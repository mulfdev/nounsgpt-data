[{"prop":{"id":150,"description":"# heyanoun - pseudonymous messages about props\n\n*thanks to Will Price for the delegated noun allowing us to make this proposal*\n\n### tl;dr\n\nA way for snapshotted nouners at a given proposal to pseudonymously submit messages about the proposal.\n\n### proposal\n\nWe believe that Nouns DAO is where the most interesting public DAO conversation is happening today. \n\nSometimes, not every opinion held is voiced though. In the past month of participating more in the DAO (noun 416), we’ve observed situations where privately held opinions don’t make it to the public discourse because they’re somewhat controversial. We believe that this is dangerous for governance. Unspoken and unresolved opinions can fester into resentment and political turmoil over time.\n\nWith this in mind, we’re building heyanoun, a way for nouners snapshotted by a proposal to comment on that proposal pseudonymously. \n\n![heyanoun mock](https://i.ibb.co/3BkBdHw/Untitled.png)\n\nNouners post a message on the heyanoun site, along with a zero-knowledge proof showing that they are in the snapshot to the relevant prop:\n\nMessages will then be passed on to a designated channel (initially could just be the funded prop’s channel) in the nouns discord server:\n\n![discord mock](https://i.ibb.co/9n3zpPW/Untitled-1.png)\n\nAll proofs will be hosted on IPFS and messages will have a link from which a user on discord can verify the proof’s veracity themselves.\n\nWe believe that this product, while simple, can surface unspoken opinions to the nouns public square and could be a huge boon to governance.\n\n### about us\n\nPersonae Labs is a new R&D lab out of [0xPARC](https://0xparc.org/) investigating how new cryptography like ZK-SNARKs changes the way we communicate online. \n\nRead our manifesto [here](https://www.notion.so/Personae-Labs-d46a90c64953416eb386a0ae2ee7679b) or watch this recent announcement talk from one of our founders [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpb1RkUoWEw).\n\nWe’ve built (to our knowledge) the earliest Eth-based pseudonymous social apps like [https://www.heyanon.xyz/](https://www.heyanon.xyz/) and [https://www.cabal.xyz/](https://www.cabal.xyz/) and are committed to furthering the technical and product frontiers here. \n\nFind us at \n\n- [https://twitter.com/personae_labs](https://twitter.com/personae_labs)\n- personaelabs.eth\n- noun 416\n\n### compensation\n\nWe foresee this project taking ~1.5mo. of dedicated effort by a team of:\n\n- 2 engineers\n- 1 designer\n- 1 PM\n\nComponents to be delivered:\n\n1. website for submitting message + ZKPs for all proposals\n2. all relevant zkp circuits\n3. discord bot for posting messages\n4. website for verifying proofs of messages (from bot)\n\nGiven a rate of 10 ETH/mo for each contributor, we’re requesting **60 ETH total** for delivery of this first app.  \n\n### future work\n\nWe hope this app is the first of many experiments around pseudonymity within Nouns DAO.\n\nIf this first iteration sees traction, we see a number of further extensions:\n\n- extend the number of places that messages are published, i.e. to a dedicated twitter account as well as discord\n- plugins/react components to integrate pseudonymous badges/proving into other governance clients (i.e. agora, discourse killer)\n- additional pseudonymous nouner groups, i.e. groups based on voting history (I voted in 10 of last 15 proposals)\n","proposer":"0x141b63D93DaF55bfb7F396eEe6114F3A5d4A90B2","startBlock":15689329,"endBlock":15709039,"executed":true},"votes":[{"support":1,"voter":"0xC3FdAdbAe46798CD8762185A09C5b672A7aA36Bb","numberOfVotes":2,"reason":"Very excited about this prop.

I connected Aubtoshi with 22 and small grants after a couple near-miss prop house rounds, and the funding she received as a result of that started her nounish journey and gave us Nouns OTG. Another example would be Jhee, a talented artist from Korea who won a contest on The Noun Square. Benbodhi then connected her to nsfw and she was funded to launch a nounish collection as a result. I could cite many other examples, but the point is: I believe flexible and nimble capital is an important tool for the DAO. I also think 22 is a very committed and hard-working contributor who does a very good job of combing through discourse and DMs to find solid proposals to fund. \n\nHaving said all of the above, I think more transparency with the day-to-day decision making of the pod would be good for the DAO generally.  I also think that it could be a real unlock for nsfw if they were to explore empowering some focused \"sub-pods\" with ETH to help further decentralize the burden of uncovering and vetting fund-worthy projects. Eg. pods for different geographic areas or niche types of proposal. Happy to help brainstorm on this concept further with 22 if interested. "}]},{"prop":{"id":152,"description":"# Nouns DAO V2 Upgrade\n\n## Summary\n\nThis proposal updates the Nouns DAO logic contract to a new version, with the following improvements and additions:\n\n1. **Dynamic Quorum**: In V1, quorum is a fixed percentage of total supply. In V2, quorum has a dynamic range, rising as a function of against votes up to a defined cap. Read [this post](https://mirror.xyz/0x10072dfc23771101dC042fD0014f263316a6E400/96zSoFfiT_RM2o2P9UbVKxPzVpB_trZqUjzllBE00BE) for more info.\n2. **Vote with Gas Refund**: Allow Nouners/delegates to vote and receive a gas refund. The vote still takes place in the case of insufficient ETH to refund.\n3. **Voting Delay Editing Bug Fix**: In V1, editing voting delay was unsafe. V2 makes it safe to edit anytime. More info on the bug [here](https://github.com/nounsDAO/nouns-diligence/blob/main/reports/proposal-58.md#major).\n4. **Cancel Proposal Bug Fix**: The DAO has a spam mitigation feature, allowing anyone to cancel a proposal if the proposer has an amount of votes less than or equal to proposal threshold. In V1, this feature didn't work when proposer had exactly proposal threshold votes; in V2 it works as expected.\n5. **Vetoer Change Is Now 2-step**: We received audit feedback that V1's vetoer change process was risky as a single-step process. In V2, the risk of setting a wrong vetoer is mitigated using a 2-step process where the current vetoer sets a pending new vetoer. Once set, the pending vetoer must accept for the change to take place.\n\n## Audit\n\n1. The code has gone through internal reviews and a [code4rena audit](https://code4rena.com/reports/2022-08-nounsdao/).\n2. **No high-risk issues were found in V2**.\n3. **Unrelated to this proposal**, one high-risk issue was found. See [this audit summary on discourse](https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/nouns-dao-v2-audit-summary/2525) for more information.\n\n\n## Dynamic Quorum Parameters\n\nAs articulated in this [detailed post](https://mirror.xyz/0x10072dfc23771101dC042fD0014f263316a6E400/96zSoFfiT_RM2o2P9UbVKxPzVpB_trZqUjzllBE00BE), three parameters need to be set for dynamic quorum. This proposal sets their values, and we’re offering the thinking behind them here:\n\n1. **Minimum quorum %**: keeping it at 10%, the same as today’s quorum.\n2. **Maximum quorum %**: setting it to 15%, taking into account recent participation levels around 30%, allowing proposals with more than 15% For votes to be decided by simple majority; the intent is for this value to provide extra protection from voter apathy, while allowing most all proposals to be decided by simple majority rather than quorum.\n3. **Coefficient**: setting it to 1, such that each against vote raises the quorum requirement by one vote, until the maximum quorum is reached.\n\nThese parameters can be edited at any time via a proposal; treat these values as the first experiment.\n\n## Vote with Gas Refund\n\nA bit more on how this feature works:\n\n1. Governance clients (like nouns.wtf/vote) need to update their code to support it.\n2. Refunds are subject to certain constraints:\n    1. Gas base fee is capped at 200 gwei.\n    2. Gas priority fee is capped at 2 gwei.\n    3. Total gas is capped at 200K, supporting voting reason text up to roughly 9,190 characters.\n    4. If the contract’s balance is insufficient, voter will receive a partial refund.\n3. This feature requires the DAO to maintain the DAO contract’s ETH balance, which should be done via periodic ETH transfer proposals from the treasury to the DAO contract (this proposal performs the first funding).\n4. The DAO can choose to withdraw refund ETH back into the treasury at any time via a proposal.\n\n\n## Proposal Transactions for Humans\n\n1. `_setImplementation`: upgrades DAO logic to V2.\n2. `_setDynamicQuorumParams`: sets dynamic quorum params to:\n    1. Minimum quorum BPs: 10% (1000 basis points).\n    2. Maximum quorum BPs: 15% (1500 basis points).\n    3. Coefficient: 1 (1,000,000 in unsigned integer with 6 decimal places).\n3. `transfer`: funding vote refunds with 12 ETH, which should be enough for just over 100 proposals at today's participation rate (excluding honk’s tendency to paste long paragraphs).\n\nAs always, please reach out in the [#54-tech-grants](https://discord.com/channels/849745721544146955/981584123225321503) channel in Discord with any questions ⌐◨-◨.","proposer":"0x05A286e5165D72823A749B00b009a2aF0dc36Ff7","startBlock":15737719,"endBlock":15757429,"executed":true},"votes":[{"support":1,"voter":"0xC8598168d8475133de3150Eff9B0cE27fB9B038d","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x9d4162CA2f01583E2f34cB594E8Cf198ACe99dd3","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x021edd67d43B365a6401a5Ee704Aa6f264F3F4e4","numberOfVotes":2,"reason":"⌐V2-V2"},{"support":1,"voter":"0x5ca6a2e5f53a48616d4ead87fF6034fc032D4722","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":"오빤 강남스타일\n강남스타일\n낮에는 따사로운 인간적인 여자\n커피 한잔의 여유를 아는 품격 있는 여자\n밤이 오면 심장이 뜨거워지는 여자\n그런 반전 있는 여자\n나는 사나이\n낮에는 너만큼 따사로운 그런 사나이\n커피 식기도 전에 원샷 때리는 사나이\n밤이 오면 심장이 터져버리는 사나이\n그런 사나이\n아름다워 사랑스러워\n그래 너 hey 그래 바로 너 hey\n아름다워 사랑스러워\n그래 너 hey 그래 바로 너 hey\n지금부터 갈 때까지 가볼까\n오빤 강남스타일\n강남스타일 오-오-오-오 오빤강남스타일\n강남스타일 오-오-오-오 오빤강남스타일\nEh, sexy lady\n오-오-오-오 오빤 강남스타일\nEh, sexy lady\n오-오-오-오\n정숙해 보이지만 놀 땐 노는 여자\n이때다 싶으면 묶었던 머리 푸는 여자\n가렸지만 웬만한 노출보다 야한 여자\n그런 감각적인 여자\n나는 사나이\n점잖아 보이지만 놀 땐 노는 사나이\n때가 되면 완전 미쳐버리는 사나이\n근육보다 사상이 울퉁불퉁한 사나이\n그런 사나이\n아름다워 사랑스러워\n그래 너 hey 그래 바로 너 hey\n아름다워 사랑스러워\n그래 너 hey 그래 바로 너 hey\n지금부터 갈 데까지 가볼까\n오빤 강남 스타일\n강남스타일 오-오-오-오 오빤 강남스타일\n강남스타일 오-오-오-오 오빤 강남스타일\nEh, sexy lady\n오-오-오-오 오빤 강남스타일\nEh, sexy lady\n오-오-오-오\n뛰는 놈 그 위에 나는 놈\nBaby baby, 나는 뭘 좀 아는 놈\n뛰는 놈 그 위에 나는 놈\nBaby baby, 나는 뭘 좀 아는 놈\n(You know what I'm sayin'?)\n오빤 강남스타일\nEh, sexy lady\n오-오-오-오 오빤 강남스타일\nEh, sexy lady\n오-오-오-오 오빤 강남스타일"},{"support":1,"voter":"0xdB7f66F3D53A6A0EC43a49C7B6713e1bd3bd1383","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x5D802e2Fe48392c104Ce0401C7ECa8a4456f1F16","numberOfVotes":16,"reason":"I would trust VERBS with my private keys.

We've clarified our deliverables, increased transparency, reduced the ask by 20%, and implemented a payment stream*\n\n## TL;DR\nWe’d like to seek funding to keep developing [Agora](https://www.nounsagora.com/) in order to improve the governance efficacy of Nouns through delegation. Our goal is to significantly increase the participation rate of nouns through a combination of software improvements, and delegation drive programs over the next quarter.\n\n## Progress so far\nWe got [funded](https://prop.house/proposal/1023) on August 31 via Prop House mandates to build an MVP. In less than one month, we’ve built a delegate platform for voters to broadcast what they want to see, and for builders to find voters who might support their proposal. To illustrate the outcome with some numbers, so far we’ve seen:\n\n* 19 statements from delegates representing 127 nouns (>25% of all votes!)\n* 25 statements from builders who are seeking delegation\n* 5 nouns delegated via Agora (that we know of)\n* Hosted a delegate race to “auction” 3 more votes to delegates\n* Proposal passed to deploy on lil nouns, as well as inbound interest from many other DAOs\n\nIn sum, Agora has created a hub that turned delegation from an invisible, behind the scenes activity, to something the community can see, participate in, discuss, and improve upon.\n\n## Roadmap & Goals\nNow that we’ve landed an MVP of a delegate platform, it’s time to start leveraging it to meaningfully drive delegation & governance participation. We expect to complete these goals and achieve their resulting outcome in roughly one quarter. Note that all points here consist of our best plan of attack today, but as we continue to build Agora, we expect the roadmap to naturally evolve as we double down on what’s working, and deprioritize what’s not.\n\n**Goal 1: Dramatically reduce friction to delegation:**\n* Integrate with nouns.wtf to propose “post-win” delegate suggestions\n* Enable direct delegation on Agora (where today we borrow the nouns.wtf flow)\n* Enable time-bound, fractional, and supercedable delegation by a proxy contract to unblock funds & whales who are currently unwilling to delegate\n* Productize delegate race so that Nouners who don’t want to pick a delegate can let the community pick for them\n\n**Goal 2: Make governance and delegation more transparent and easy to understand**\n* Continue investing in surfacing more delegate and voting data on Agora\n* Build a governance activity feed that highlights delegation, ownership change, voting, and other governance related activities.\n* Make other general improvements to Agora to make it a first class experience for governance participants\n\n**Goal 3: Activate nouns holders to either vote or delegate**\n* Direct outreach to inactive Nouners from Agora team to find them a suitable delegate\n* Implement an inactive nouner bounty program, highlighting and incentivizing the community to reach out to inactive holders.\n* Run a marketplace experiment to allow anyone to rent votes from Nouns holders\n* Run a direct reward (in both ETH and NFT prizes) experiment to directly incentivize voting\n\n**Target objectives in 3 months:**\n* 75% of new nouns are delegated to voters who vote on more than 50% of props they're eligible to\n* 50% participation in a rolling average of past 3 proposals\n\n## Transparency & decentralization\nAs a governance platform, we will take measures to maintain transparency and avoid centralization of power by taking the following measures: \n* Make Github repo public within 1 month (with proper documentation to come over time)\n* Publish all data monthly to public google sheets, or equivalent (such as API or onchain mirror)\n* Current Agora team members added together will commit to not represent more than 5% of nouns.\n\n## Team\nYitong – Project lead & designer: co-founder of Vector DAO, and previously design + product at Coinbase. Prop builder for #87, contributor to Nouns Vision, delegate.\n\n0xcaff – Engineer: Built the v1 of Agora, previously engineer at Coinbase.\n\nTom Taubkin – Protocol Engineer: Contributor to several defi projects, previously engineer at Coinbase\n\nMrtn – Ops / Community: Delegate from nounlets, funded via Prop House as governance historian, deployed Agora on lil nouns, previously pm on nouns.builder, and pm at Google.\n\n## Funding request & terms\n**Funding request:**\n\nWe’d like to request $221,000 to fund the team for a quarter (170ETH @ $1300/ETH, a 20% decrease from previous ask) and 20 ETH to incentivize voter participation.\n\n**Fund transfer mechanics**\n\n50% of the team portion & the participation incentive will be immediately deposited to the team’s wallet\n\n50% of the team portion will be streamed over a period of three months from a 3/5 multisig held by trusted members of the community. Signers for this safe will be: Elad, Krel, Yitong, Seneca, and one more to be confirmed.\n\nAs of this writing, $221,000 is 170 ETH. In order to account for ETH volatility, we will request a 30 ETH buffer. Upon fund release, $221,000 worth of ETH will be sold, with half deposited to the Agora multisig, and half deposited to the stream multisig. The remaining ETH will be sent back to the treasury.\n\n## Appendix: some illustrative mocks\nThese are purely concepts to illustrate some of the areas we’re going to invest in.

Working on Nouns full-time has been an amazing opportunity. I'd like to continue my work for the next 6 months as well. It's been an incredible learning experience, and I love building projects that serve the DAO and bring joy to the Nouns community.\n\n### **Overview of what I’ve done the last 6 months:**\n## **[PROP HOUSE](https://prop.house/)**\nI spent most of my time working on the **complete site redesign**. Besides making it more aesthetically pleasing, and cleaning up the codebase (removing unused code as we prepared to open-source it), I worked on new features to **increase the overall user experience** including:\n**-** New homepage with statistics\n**-** Dynamic social sharing cards\n**-** House & Round pages\n**-** Voting progress bar\n**-** User proposal progress card\n**-** Japanese translations\n**-** Rich text editor for prop creation\n**-** Search bar for Home, FAQ, House, and Round pages\n\n![prophouse](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/nouns/optimized/2X/1/190db5ad7841b57c47f1765534f99ea4ea514aaf_2_1380x832.jpeg)\n\n\n\n## **[NOUNS CENTER](https://nouns.center/)**\nThe site has received **18K total site visits** and is officially **linked from the Docs tab** of [nouns.wtf](https://nouns.wtf/). It has been forked by 4 NFT communities: Lil Nouns, Mfers, Blitmap, and Forgotten Runes to be used as a tool for their community. I did automation work with Brian to allow for projects and talent to add themselves more easily as the site scales. I also shipped several new pages and updates: \n**-** Funding (plus 3 funding guides: proposals, small grants, and prop house)\n**-** SubDaos\n**-** Dev Center (Docs, APIs, contract links, and Github repos)\n**-** Discord Channels\n**-** Learn (educational content from Nouncil YouTube)\n**-** Ideas\n**-** New assets (2 Figma boards, updated color palette, and 3D voxel noggles files)\n**-** New homepage\n\n![nounscenter](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/nouns/optimized/2X/d/dd1863e672d5828dce841f6074f1110d5bcaa06f_2_1380x834.png)\n\n## **[NOUN O' TALK](http://nounotalk.com/)**\nI released **14 episodes** with **33 guests**.

I personally edited all past episodes. I recently brought on 2 producers to increase the quality. The next push will be YouTube. I created a [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCR5cYWsmNUELNY7-txoba-Q) (69 subscribers) so that we can upload full episodes, as well as 3-5 video clips, each week. I am personally a big YouTube user for podcasts and I believe this will be a great way to spread the word about Nouns on a platform we don't have a huge presence in. \n\n![new_episodes](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/nouns/optimized/2X/c/ce7a16ae87085bcb48ad405ed1a84ab0daff1ddd_2_1380x832.jpeg)\n\n### **What I plan to work on for the next 6 months:**\n\n## **[PROP HOUSE](https://prop.house/)**\nI will **continue developing the Prop House web app**. As we prepare for the protocol launch, I will work on fixing bugs and frontend improvements, as I manage the vast majority of the frontend you see. I will add Spanish translations to the site and I will continue to ensure it's the best tool that it can be.\n\n## **[NOUNS CENTER](https://nouns.center/)**\nI'd like to [conduct a Prop House round](https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/small-grants-prop-house-design-round-for-nouns-center/2601) for a proper redesign of the entire site and lead the development to create a **Nouns Center v2**. I will add documentation, as in a README with install instructions, and clean up the code to make it fork-friendly for other communities. I aim to **implement Search** across the entire site for easier access to all the information. I plan to **add translations** (Japanese & Spanish) too.\n\n## **[NOUN O' TALK](http://nounotalk.com/)**\nI will continue to book guests, do my own extensive interview prep, and **host the pod** itself. I also **manage the podcast team** (Messhup for art and Matthew & Brileigh, our two producers). Besides the weekly podcast I want to grow and **proliferate Nouns via YouTube** as I mentioned above.

In 1987, he wrote the first commercial anti-virus software, founding McAfee Associates to sell his creation. He resigned in 1994 and sold his remaining stake in the company.[5] McAfee became the company's most vocal critic in later years, urging consumers to uninstall the company's anti-virus software, which he characterized as bloatware. He disavowed the company's continued use of his name in branding, a practice that has persisted in spite of a short-lived corporate rebrand attempt under Intel ownership.\n\nMcAfee's fortunes plummeted in the financial crisis of 2007–2008. After leaving McAfee Associates, he founded the companies Tribal Voice (makers of the PowWow chat program), QuorumEx, and Future Tense Central, among others, and was involved in leadership positions in the companies Everykey, MGT Capital Investments, and Luxcore, among others. His personal and business interests included smartphone apps, cryptocurrency, yoga, light-sport aircraft[6] and recreational drug use. He resided for a number of years in Belize, but returned to the United States in 2013 while wanted in Belize for questioning on suspicion of murder.[7]\n\nIn October 2020, McAfee was arrested in Spain over U.S. tax evasion charges.[8] U.S. federal prosecutors brought criminal and civil charges alleging that McAfee had failed to file income taxes over a four-year period.[9][10] On 23 June 2021, he was found dead due to an apparent suicide by hanging in his prison cell near Barcelona shortly after the Spanish National Court authorized his extradition to the U.S.[11][12][13] His death generated speculation and conspiracy theories about the possibility that he was murdered.[14] McAfee's wife, Janice McAfee, said she did not believe McAfee committed suicide, and claimed the suicide note was a forgery.[15][16]\n\nMcAfee was born in Cinderford, in the Forest of Dean, Gloucestershire, England,[17] on 18 September 1945,[18] on a U.S. Army base (of the 596th Ordnance Ammunition Company), to an American father, Don McAfee, who was stationed there, and a British mother, Joan (Williams).[19][20] His father was from Roanoke, Virginia, and McAfee was himself primarily raised in Salem, Virginia, United States. He said he felt as much British as American.[21] When he was 15, his father, whom a BBC columnist described as \"an abusive alcoholic\", killed himself with a gun.[21] He had spent his childhood living in fear that a beating from his father could happen at any time, and struggled to make sense of why this was happening to him.[18]\n\nMcAfee received a bachelor's degree in mathematics in 1967 from Roanoke College in Virginia, which subsequently awarded him an honorary Doctor of Science degree in 2008.[22] After receiving his bachelor's degree, McAfee began working towards a doctorate in mathematics at Northeast Louisiana State College but was expelled, in about 1968, because of a relationship with an undergraduate student, who became his first wife.[23]\n\nMcAfee was employed as a programmer by NASA's Institute for Space Studies in New York City from 1968 to 1970 working on the Apollo program. From there, he went to Univac as a software designer, and later to Xerox as an operating system architect. In 1978, he joined Computer Sciences Corporation as a software consultant. He worked for consulting firm Booz Allen Hamilton from 1980 to 1982.[24] In 1986, while employed by Lockheed, he read about the Brain computer virus made for the PC, and he found it terrifying.[23] Sensing a business opportunity, he went about creating an antivirus software that could detect the computer virus and remove it automatically.[20] In 1987 McAfee created McAfee Associates Inc. to sell this software, which he named VirusScan.[22] This was the first anti-virus software brought to market, and one of the first software products to be distributed over the Internet.[20][22]\n\nInitially McAfee did not seek a large userbase of paying users, but rather wanted to raise awareness of the need to be protected from computer viruses. However, by making people fear such malware, he managed to generate millions of sales, and by 1990 he was making five million dollars a year.[18] The company was incorporated in Delaware in 1992, and had its initial public offering the same year. In August 1993, McAfee stepped down as chief executive and remained with the company as the chief technical officer. He was succeeded by Bill Larson.[25] In 1994 he sold his remaining stake in the company.[26] He had no further involvement in its operations.[5]\n\nAfter various mergers and ownership changes, Intel acquired McAfee in August 2010.[27] In January 2014, Intel announced that McAfee-related products would be marketed as Intel Security. McAfee expressed his pleasure at the name change, saying, \"I am now everlastingly grateful to Intel for freeing me from this terrible association with the worst software on the planet.\"[28] The business was soon de-merged from Intel, once more under the McAfee name.\n\nOther business ventures that were founded by McAfee include Tribal Voice, which developed one of the first instant messaging programs,[29] PowWow. In 2000, he invested in and joined the board of directors of Zone Labs, makers of firewall software, prior to its acquisition by Check Point Software in 2003.[30]\n\nIn the 2000s McAfee invested in and advertised ultra-light flights, which he marketed as aerotrekking.[6]\n\nIn August 2009 The New York Times reported that McAfee's personal fortune had declined to $4 million from a peak of $100 million due to the effect of the financial crisis of 2007–2008 on his investments.[26]\n\nIn 2009, McAfee was interviewed in Belize for the CNBC special The Bubble Decade, in which it was reported that he had invested in and/or built many mansions in the USA that went unsold when the 2007 global recession hit. The report also discussed his quest to raise plants for possible medicinal uses on his land in Belize.[31]\n\nIn February 2010, McAfee started the company QuorumEx,[32] headquartered in Belize, which aimed to produce herbal antibiotics that disrupt quorum sensing in bacteria.[33][34]\n\nIn June 2013, McAfee uploaded a parody video titled How to Uninstall McAfee Antivirus onto his YouTube channel. In it, he critiques the antivirus software while snorting white powder and being stripped by scantily clad women. It received ten million views. He told Reuters the video was meant to ridicule the media's negative coverage of him. A spokesman for McAfee Inc. called the video's statements \"ludicrous\".[35]\n\nAlso in 2013, McAfee founded Future Tense Central, which aimed to produce a secure computer network device called the D-Central.[36] By 2016, it was also an incubator.[37]\n\nIn February 2014, McAfee announced Cognizant, an application for smartphones, which displays information about the permissions of other installed applications.[38] In April 2014, it was renamed DCentral 1, and an Android version was released for free on Google Play.[39][40]\n\n\nMcAfee at DEF CON 2015\nAt the DEF CON conference in Las Vegas in August 2014, McAfee warned people not to use smartphones, suggesting apps are used to spy on clueless consumers who do not read privacy user agreements.[41] In January 2016, he became the chief evangelist for security startup Everykey.[37]\n\nIn February 2016, McAfee publicly volunteered to decrypt the iPhone used by Rizwan Farook and Tashfeen Malik in San Bernardino, avoiding the need for Apple to build a backdoor.[42] He later admitted that his claims regarding the ease of cracking the phone were a publicity stunt, while still asserting its possibility.[43]\n\nIn May 2016, McAfee was appointed chairman and CEO of MGT Capital Investments, a technology holding company. It initially said it would rename itself John McAfee Global Technologies,[44] although this plan was abandoned due to a dispute with Intel over rights to the \"McAfee\" name.[45] He changed MGT's focus from social gaming to cybersecurity, saying \"anti-virus software is dead, it no longer works\", and that \"the new paradigm has to stop the hacker getting in\" before he or she can do damage.[46]\n\nSoon after joining MGT, McAfee said he and his team had exploited a flaw in the Android operating system that allowed him to read encrypted messages from WhatsApp.[47] Gizmodo investigated his claim, and reported that he had sent reporters malware-infected phones to make this hack work. He replied: \"Of course the phones had malware on them. How that malware got there is the story, which we will release after speaking with Google. It involves a serious flaw in the Android architecture.\"[48]\n\nMcAfee moved MGT into the mining of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, both to make money for the company, and to increase MGT's expertise in dealing with blockchains, which he thought was important for cybersecurity.[49]\n\nIn August 2017, McAfee stepped down as CEO, instead serving as MGT's \"chief cybersecurity visionary\". In January 2018, he left the company altogether. Both sides said the split was amicable; he said he wanted to spend all of his time on cryptocurrencies, while the company told of pressure from potential investors to disassociate itself from him.[50]\n\nOn 13 August 2018, McAfee took a position of CEO with Luxcore, a cryptocurrency company focused on enterprise solutions.[51]\n\nMcAfee was a libertarian, advocating the decriminalization of cannabis, an end to the war on drugs, non-interventionism in foreign policy, a free market economy which does not redistribute wealth, and upholding free trade. He supported abolishing the Transportation Security Administration.[52]\n\nMcAfee advocated increased cyber awareness and more action against the threat of cyberwarfare.[53] He pushed religious liberty, saying that business owners should be able to deny service in circumstances that contradict their religious beliefs, adding: \"No one is forcing you to buy anything or to choose one person over another. So why should I be forced to do anything if I am not harming you? It's my choice to sell, your choice to buy.\"[54]\n\nOn 8 September 2015, McAfee announced a bid for president of the United States in the 2016 presidential election, as the candidate of a newly formed political party called the Cyber Party.[19][55] On 24 December 2015, he re-announced his candidacy bid saying that he would instead seek the presidential nomination of the Libertarian Party.[37][56] On the campaign trail, he consistently polled alongside the party's other top candidates, Gary Johnson and Austin Petersen.[57] The three partook in the Libertarian Party's first nationally televised presidential debate on 29 March 2016.[58] His running mate was photographer, commercial real estate broker and Libertarian activist Judd Weiss.[59]\n\nMcAfee came in second in the primaries[60] and third at the 2016 Libertarian National Convention.[61]\n\nContrary to his assertion at the 2016 convention, McAfee tweeted on 3 June 2018 that he would run for president again in 2020, either with the Libertarian Party or a separate party that he would create.[65] He later chose to run as a Libertarian.[66] He mainly campaigned for wider cryptocurrency use.\n\nOn 22 January 2019, McAfee tweeted that he would continue his campaign \"in exile\", following reports that he, his wife, and four campaign staff were indicted for tax-related felonies by the IRS. He said he was in \"international waters\", and had previously tweeted that he was going to Venezuela.[67] The IRS has not commented on the alleged indictments.[68] He defended Communist revolutionary Che Guevara on Twitter, putting himself at odds with Libertarian National Committee chairman Nicholas Sarwark, who wrote, \"I hear very little buzz about McAfee this time around ... making a defense of Che Guevara from Cuba may ingratiate him with the Cuban government, but it didn't resonate well with Libertarians.\"[69]\n\nIn a tweet on 4 March 2020, McAfee simultaneously suspended his 2020 presidential campaign, endorsed Vermin Supreme, and announced his campaign for the Libertarian Party vice presidential nomination.[70] The next day, he returned to the presidential field, reversing the suspension of his bid, as \"No one in the Libertarian Party Would consider me For Vice President.\"[71] The next month, he endorsed Adam Kokesh and became Kokesh's vice-presidential candidate, while still seeking the presidency for himself.[72] At the 2020 Libertarian National Convention, he again lost, now to Jo Jorgensen and Spike Cohen for the presidential and vice-presidential slots.[73]\n\nMcAfee contended that taxes were illegal, and claimed in 2019 that he had not filed a tax return since 2010. He referred to himself as \"a prime target\" of the Internal Revenue Service.[74]\n\nIn July 2017, McAfee predicted on Twitter that the price of a bitcoin would jump to $500,000 within three years, adding: \"If not, I will eat my own dick on national television.\"[75] In July 2019, he predicted a price of $1 million by the end of 2020.[76] In January 2020, he tweeted that his predictions were \"a ruse to onboard new users\", and that bitcoin had limited potential because it is \"an ancient technology.\"[77]\n\nMcAfee was named a defendant in a 2008 civil court case related to his Aerotrekking light-sport aircraft venture and the death of nephew Joel Bitow and a passenger.[78]\n\nOn 30 April 2012, McAfee's property in Orange Walk Town, Belize, was raided by the Gang Suppression Unit of the Belize Police Department. A GSU press release said he was arrested for unlicensed drug manufacturing and possession of an unlicensed weapon.[34][79][80] He was released without charge.[81]\n\nIn 2012, Belize police spokesman Raphael Martinez confirmed that McAfee was neither convicted nor charged, only suspected.[82]\n\nIn January 2014, while in Canada, he said that when the Belizean government raided his property, it seized his assets, and that his house later burned down under suspicious circumstances.[83]\n\nOn 2 August 2015, McAfee was arrested in Henderson County, Tennessee, on one count of driving under the influence and one count of possession of a firearm while intoxicated.[84]\n\nIn July 2019, McAfee and members of his entourage were arrested while his yacht was docked at Puerto Plata, Dominican Republic, on suspicion of carrying high-caliber weapons and ammunition. They were held for four days and released.[85] Weapons were seized, according to the Public Ministry.[86]\n\nOn 11 August 2020, McAfee falsely stated that he was arrested in Norway during the COVID-19 pandemic after refusing to replace a lace thong with a more effective face mask. He later tweeted a picture of himself with a bruised eye, claiming it occurred during this arrest.[87] The photo of the alleged arrest shows an officer with the German word for \"police\" on his uniform, invalidating McAfee's claim of having been arrested in Norway. The Augsburg police later said he tried to enter Germany on that day, but was not arrested.[88]\n\nOn 12 November 2012, Belize police began to search for McAfee as a person of interest in connection to the homicide investigation of American expatriate Gregory Viant Faull, who was found dead of a gunshot wound the day before, at his home on the island of Ambergris Caye, the largest island in Belize.[89][90] Faull was a neighbor of McAfee's.[91] In a contemporary interview with Wired,[92] McAfee said he had been afraid police would kill him and refused their routine questions and evaded them.[91] He buried himself in sand for several hours with a cardboard box over his head.[18] Belize's prime minister, Dean Barrow, called him \"extremely paranoid, even bonkers\".[93] He fled Belize rather than cooperate.[94][95][96]\n\nIn December 2012, the magazine Vice accidentally gave away McAfee's location at a Guatemalan resort, when a photo taken by one of its journalists accompanying him was posted with the EXIF geolocation metadata still attached.[97]\n\nWhile in Guatemala, McAfee asked Chad Essley, an American cartoonist and animator, to set up a blog so he could write about his experience while on the run.[98] He then appeared publicly in Guatemala City, where he unsuccessfully sought political asylum.[99]\n\nOn 5 December 2012, he was arrested for illegally entering Guatemala. Shortly afterward, the board reviewing his asylum plea denied it and he was taken to a detention center to await deportation to Belize.[100]\n\nOn 6 December 2012, Reuters and ABC News reported that McAfee had two minor heart attacks in the detention center and was hospitalized.[101][102] His lawyer said he had no heart attacks, rather high blood pressure and anxiety attacks.[103][104][105] McAfee later said he faked the heart attacks to buy time for his attorney to file a series of appeals that ultimately prevented his deportation to Belize, thus hastening that government's decision to send him back to the United States.[106]\n\nOn 12 December 2012, McAfee was released and deported to the United States.[107]\n\nOn 14 November 2018, the Circuit Court in Orlando, Florida, refused to dismiss a wrongful death lawsuit against him for Faull's death.[108][109]\n\nIn January 2019, McAfee announced that he was on the run from U.S. authorities, and living internationally on a boat following the convening of a grand jury to indict him, his wife, and four of his 2020 Libertarian Party presidential primaries staff on tax evasion charges.[110] At the time, the Internal Revenue Service had not independently confirmed the existence of any such indictment.[110]\n\nOn 5 October 2020, McAfee was arrested in Spain at the request of the United States Department of Justice for tax evasion. The June indictment, which was unsealed upon his arrest, alleged he earned millions of dollars from 2014 to 2018, and failed to file income tax returns.[111]\n\nOn 6 October, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed a complaint further alleging McAfee and his bodyguard promoted certain initial coin offerings (ICOs) in a fraudulent cryptocurrency pump and dump scheme.[112] It claims he presented himself as an impartial investor when he promoted the ICOs, despite allegedly getting paid $23 million in digital assets in return.[112]\n\nOn 5 March 2021, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York formally indicted him and an executive adviser on these charges.[113]\n\nMcAfee was jailed in Spain, pending extradition to the United States.[113][114]\n\nOn 23 June 2021, the Spanish National Court authorized his extradition to face charges in Tennessee;[115][5] McAfee is suspected to have committed suicide several hours after the authorization. The New York extradition case was still pending in a lower Spanish court.[5]\n\nMcAfee married three times. He met his first wife circa 1968 while he was working towards a doctorate at Northeast Louisiana State College and she was an undergraduate student.[23] Their affair led to his expulsion from the college.[23] He married his second wife, Judy, a former flight attendant at American Airlines, circa 1987; they divorced in 2002.[23] The night after McAfee arrived in the United States after being deported from Guatemala in December 2012, he was solicited by and slept with Janice Dyson, then a sex worker 30 years his junior in South Beach, Miami Beach, Florida.[116] They began a relationship and married in 2013.[117] She claims that he saved her from human traffickers.[18]\n\nThe couple moved to Portland, Oregon, in 2013.[118]\n\nIn a 2012 article in Mensa Bulletin, the magazine of the American Mensa, McAfee said developing the first commercial antivirus program had made him \"the most popular hacking target\" and \"[h]ackers see hacking me as a badge of honor\". For his own cybersecurity, he said he had other people buy his computer equipment for him, used pseudonyms for setting up computers and logins, and changed his IP address several times a day.[119] When asked on another occasion if he personally used McAfee's antivirus software, he replied: \"I take it off[...]it's too annoying.\"[120]\n\nIn 2015, he resided in Lexington, Tennessee.[84] In December 2018, he tweeted that he has \"47 genetic children\".[121][122][123][124] His third wife described him in a Father's Day message as \"father of many, loved by few\".[18]\n\nOn 23 June 2021, McAfee was found dead in his prison cell at the Brians 2 Penitentiary Center [ca] near Barcelona, hours after the Spanish National Court ordered his extradition to the United States on criminal charges filed in Tennessee by the United States Department of Justice Tax Division.[5] The Catalan Justice Department said \"everything indicates\" he killed himself by hanging.[11][125][126][127] An official autopsy confirmed his suicide.[128][13]\n\nMcAfee's death ignited speculation and conspiracy theories about the possibility that he was murdered. McAfee's death drew comparisons to the circumstances of the death of American financier Jeffrey Epstein, who was found dead in August 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges.[129][130] Several times, McAfee claimed if he were ever found dead by hanging, it would mean he was murdered.[131] Minutes after the report of his death, an image of the letter Q was posted to his Instagram feed (his account was subsequently taken down), apparently in reference to QAnon conspiracy theories.[132][133][134] These theories have been referred to by some journalists as speculative, \"bizarre,\" and \"baseless,\" primarily based on McAfee's own statements.[132][133][134] The day after his death, his lawyer told reporters that while he regularly maintained contact with McAfee in prison, there were no signs of suicidal intent.[135] McAfee's widow reaffirmed this position in her first public remarks since her husband's death, and also called for a \"thorough\" investigation.[136][137]\n\nOn 13 February 2022, a Spanish court ruled McAfee died by suicide.[138]\n\nIn a Netflix documentary released on August 24, 2022, entitled Running With the Devil: The Wild World of John McAfee, McAfee's ex-girlfriend, identified as Samantha Herrera, alleged that McAfee faked his death to avoid tax evasion charges. This allegation has not been proven, however.[139][140]\n\nGringo: The Dangerous Life of John McAfee is a Showtime Networks documentary about the portion of McAfee's life spent in Belize. It began airing in September 2016.[141] It covers allegations against him of raping his former business partner, Allison Adonizio, and murdering Belizean David Middleton and American expat Gregory Faull.[142][143] In an interview with Bloomberg's Pimm Fox and Kathleen Hayes on 8 September 2016, he said these incidents were fabricated, and \"Belize is a third-world banana republic and you can go down there and make any story you want if you pay your interviewees, which Showtime did.\"[144][145]\n\nIn March 2017, it was reported that Glenn Ficarra and John Requa would direct a film about McAfee titled King of the Jungle, written by Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski. At various points, Johnny Depp, Michael Keaton, and Seth Rogen were reported to have taken roles and later to have left the project. In November 2019, Zac Efron was reported to star as journalist Ari Furman.[146][147][148][149]\n\nOn 12 May 2017, McAfee and his wife were interviewed on ABC News's 20/20 regarding Faull's alleged murder.[150]\n\nThe aforementioned documentary Running With the Devil: The Wild World of John McAfee includes footage from an unreleased documentary by Vice, and interviews by Rocco Castoro, Alex Cody Foster, and Robert King.[151]\n\n"},{"support":1,"voter":"0xA1c0b11B86A46885B87c7ed68b91FAa0C349e1cD","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0xC8598168d8475133de3150Eff9B0cE27fB9B038d","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":"who is CDT ?"},{"support":1,"voter":"0x0B3CF56E7dF3BB3Fb7201fFcD96d279b05DDd2E3","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x36A5Bc205DF1ED65C86301022cfc343a6ce546ff","numberOfVotes":2,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0xdB7f66F3D53A6A0EC43a49C7B6713e1bd3bd1383","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x2746D2693e4A80dC567f16d9c86A901f86734FD7","numberOfVotes":2,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x4754b7e3DEde42D71d6c92978f25F306176EC7e9","numberOfVotes":32,"reason":"gm beautifulnfts.eth how are you today?"},{"support":1,"voter":"0xd44e9b676e74aE45C0A39150be771Eb189BB2337","numberOfVotes":2,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x696ed7b26f4B019CEeC78DC8b9140ad64A6f354B","numberOfVotes":11,"reason":"Keep up the good work CDT! \n----------------------------\nGood morning @Will! \n---------------------- \nI don’t think it’s a good idea to have censored my Discord post about Poap.eth’s 10 million dollar ‘never going to be accepted’ cryptopunk bid.

Further empowering Roko to be an AI secretary/assistant for the DAO! Helping information flow better with summaries, transcripts, reviews, answering questions and more. \n2. Generating Nounish rich media (images, gifs, videos) and making the tools to generate such media accessible to the community at large to unleash their creativity\n3. Empowering other pods (e.g. ai-based team drafting for e-sports, planning events for otg)\n\nWith each of these being built with monetization / expansion to other organizations in mind.\n\n---\n\n### WELL HOW DID THE INITIAL RESEARCH GO?\n\nYou can see the initial small grant proposal here [https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/small-grants-the-nouns-ecosystem-and-ai/1929](https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/small-grants-the-nouns-ecosystem-and-ai/1929)  and Honk's extension post here [https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/nouns-ai-honk-residency-extension/2357](https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/nouns-ai-honk-residency-extension/2357)\n\n![https://imgur.com/JPkgn07](https://imgur.com/JPkgn07.png)\n\n[https://staging.roko.dev/](https://staging.roko.dev/) Is a live website where the team is experimenting and adding features with the goal of building a production ready webapp.\n\nWe initially set out to accomplish two sprints, the first to be able to break down proposals into understandable summaries / reviews. The second was more focused on demonstrating some of the possibilities of AI and what it could bring to Nouns.\n\nI am happy to report that, thanks to an engaged community and support from key contributors Honk and Evets.eth we blew that goal out of the water.\n\nTogether, we:\n\n- Held weekly sessions on Tuesdays which about 30 people regularly attended that shared developments with the project as well as educating them on fundamentals as well as cutting edge developments in machine learning\n- Built a pipeline that can breakdown proposals into reviews automatically as they as proposed on-chain (and post them to Twitter!!)\n- Built pipeline to turn recorded calls into text using SOTA voice to text then using a large language model to convert them into a bulleted summary\n\n![https://imgur.com/voyrcfZ](https://imgur.com/voyrcfZ.png)\n\n- Built a web interface that enables participants to easily consume summarized proposal content as well as edit them to better reflect their opinions\n    - [https://staging.roko.dev/](https://staging.roko.dev/)\n- Tested the ability to finetune our model using user generated content as guidance\n- Setup a backend infrastructure setup to support the ongoing development and improvement of the web interface\n- In addition, due to popular demand we began diving deep into AI generated media, we were able to generate images and video content (reactive to sound!) that features custom content (Noggles!)\n\n![https://imgur.com/hCb6gWe](https://imgur.com/hCb6gWe.png)\n\n![https://imgur.com/J1KHLy6](https://imgur.com/J1KHLy6.png)\n\n![https://imgur.com/gKTir4X](https://imgur.com/gKTir4X.png)\n\n![https://imgur.com/Vd9t0po](https://imgur.com/Vd9t0po.png)\n\n[The AI pod promo Video!!](https://youtu.be/b5Ojfo6gVcU)\n\n---\n\n### NEXT STEPS: THE AI POD\n\nThe proposed AI Pod will have 3 main focuses:\n\n1. Continue Bringing Roko to life in the form of an AI Assistant to DAO members:\n- All Nouners and teams of funded props should have access to Roko's summarization capabilities for their related audio or text content (as long as they provide feedback on their results!!)\n- Work towards improving Roko’s corpus of data (e.g. Discourse posts, Discord messages) and learn how to incorporate these into a model to improve Roko’s Nounish knowledge base.\n- Roko's website could also be updated to include a search page where people could semantically search across that knowledge base whether it is just meeting / proposal content or if Discord / Discourse content was included.\n2. Explore AI Generated Media\n- Implement and host SOTA open source image generation models customized to be able to generate Noggles on powerful GPU servers so any DAO member can access it. \n- Implement cutting edge developments as they are released (e.g. text to video, img to img, text to 3d, etc.), share our knowledge with the community, and incentivize their use!\n3. Community Engagement, Marketing, and Outreach (Competitions!!)\n- Put together competitions (with prizes!!) alongside groups like NoC to show off the best showcases of AI generated media leveraging Nouns AI tooling.\n- Assist various pods and DAO members with content generation - we've already had suggestions from helping visualize proposals to making and AI content generated coffee book and I know the community will have plenty more great ideas!!\n- Potential prop house round for utilizing the tooling?\n- Seek out partnerships with these opensource or other organizations to see if they would be interested in collaborating to try and further proliferate the brand!\n    - I’d LOVE to see us partner with some musicians to work with them to make them free music videos they could post that have Noun glasses in them or have a live show with AI generated visuals featuring Noggles\n\n---\n\n### THE FUTURE OF AI POD:\n\nHopefully, during these three months, we will be able to not only share significant advancements in AI with the community, but also have a plan for how to take the next steps to grow the AI Pod further.\nWe want to be able to show a path where this could become a self-sustaining effort that could grow and expand to other organizations, opening up a pipeline for monetization.\nWe believe that this is a great opportunity to only grow and expand the Nouns ecosystem but give everyone who is a part of it superpowers that help proliferating the meme!!\n\n---\n\n### TEAM:\n\n- The Hero Shep (Background in AI/Education/Product Management)\n- Honk Diddly (Wizard [elite full stack developer])\n- Evets.ETH (Wizard [full stack developer])\n\n---\n\n### BUDGET: 164 ETH\n\n- 10% for all related infra (5k/mo)\n- 30% for The Hero Shep (20k per month)\n- 25% for Honk (15k per month)\n- 15% for Evets.ETH (10k per month)\n- 20% for Marketing and Community Engagement (Not only compensation for prizes but also to pay people to manage / run the competitions (e.g. prop house, NOC contests) & support other initiatives that arise. )\n\nBUFFER of 15% for volatility - All ETH not used strictly for reasons relating to volatility in ETH price or infra will be added to the Marketing and Community Engagement Funds\n\nThis budget will be governed by the members of the AI Pod and controlled by a 2/3 multi-sig.","proposer":"0x5d4df391F56f0D8F854434E52A15b10b6501129f","startBlock":15785594,"endBlock":15805304,"executed":true},"votes":[{"support":1,"voter":"0xC8598168d8475133de3150Eff9B0cE27fB9B038d","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x5d4df391F56f0D8F854434E52A15b10b6501129f","numberOfVotes":3,"reason":"the beginning of something great"},{"support":1,"voter":"0x008c84421dA5527F462886cEc43D2717B686A7e4","numberOfVotes":5,"reason":"Impressed by the work to date"},{"support":1,"voter":"0xC3FdAdbAe46798CD8762185A09C5b672A7aA36Bb","numberOfVotes":2,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0xDCb4117e3A00632efCaC3C169E0B23959f555E5e","numberOfVotes":8,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x36A5Bc205DF1ED65C86301022cfc343a6ce546ff","numberOfVotes":2,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0xCF4e26a7e7eAe4b3840dd31C527096e1265AB990","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":"Mind-blowing innovation here.

We don't yet have a problem with spam, and noun ownership is still a lofty bar (nobody is spending 50 ETH for the lulz), so I support lowering the threshold to 1 noun for now.

We are asking for 23.25 ETH.\n\n## Context\nWe are NounsDAO Amigos. We are building a Spanish-speakers community for LatAm and beyond. We’ve been proliferating the ⌐◨-◨ adding some spice and a pinch of Ñs.\n\nWe recently hosted the second edition of the Nouns Fair. An IRL fun experience aimed to proliferate Nouns at the ETHBogota hackathon. We’ve confirmed the importance of this kind of event that helps increase awareness of the DAO, onboard potential builders, and put noggles in the eyes of hundreds.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qe1R5WFT9_E](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qe1R5WFT9_E)\n\nMore detailed info can be found here - [https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/nsfw-nouns-fair-ethbogota/2326](https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/nsfw-nouns-fair-ethbogota/2326) & [https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/nsfw-nouns-fair-ethbogota/2326/7?u=mono](https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/nsfw-nouns-fair-ethbogota/2326/7?u=mono)\n\n## Nouns Fair @ETHSanFrancisco\nGiven the success of the Nouns Fair in Colombia, **the ETHGlobal team invited NounsDAOAmigos to make a new edition, this time at ETHSanFrancisco!** We believe it’s important to keep having a presence at IRL events like this. As we saw in Mexico and Colombia, this is a great environment for spreading the ⌐◨-◨ and growing our Spanish-speaker community.\n\n**Goals**\n- Make a new amigo, San Francisco\n- Onboard potential contributors\n- Put Nouns in the eyes of hundreds of builders\n\n**Details**\n\nPlace: San Francisco, California\nVenue: Palace of Fine Arts\nDates: November 4 - 6, 2022\nTeam: NounsDAOAmigos\n\nThe Nouns Fair will be a 3-day cultural experience focused on builders where they will be able to engage with others and learn about Nouns. This activation will be a localized nounish experience with photo opportunities, games, merchandise, and an NFT gallery. The proliferation of culture á la nounish. The following are examples of what happened in Bogotá and what we’ll create for San Francisco with a different flavor:\n\n**Photo-opportunity & noggles**\nA fully Nouns-branded photo station where attendees can take selfies and full-body photos will serve as a welcoming station. We want to create a photo set where people can feel nounish and share it on the internet. Of course, physical noggles are key.\n![](https://i.imgur.com/XGMsKWG.jpg)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/i9Ww7cU.jpg)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/W9LifGd.jpg)\n\n\n\n**Games**\nTwo different games will be available at the place: **foosball**, and **a traditional local game**. We believe these games have a nounish feeling and will serve as an engagement factor.\n![](https://i.imgur.com/14ONVu1.jpg)\n\n\n\n**Merchandise**\nPins, stickers, and T-shirts will be distributed as rewards for spending time and engaging with the Nouns Fair by playing games and taking photos.\n![](https://i.imgur.com/TEqCnbF.jpg)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/exzjPyD.jpg)\n\n\n\n**NFT gallery**\nA 5 screens NFT gallery representing local artists and some nounish representatives.\n![](https://i.imgur.com/SvvfxNS.jpg)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/iCu328D.jpg)\n\n\n**Costs and execution**\nGiven our past experiences and the recent Nouns Fairs at ETHMexico and ETHBogota, we came up with this budget to make it suitable for ETHSanFrancisco in the US. **We are asking for 23.25 ETH**.\n![](https://i.imgur.com/XSlixrD.png)\n\n\nCosts are approximate. ETH avg. price of 1,200 USD. Prices in red are not final and we'll seek to reduce costs as much as possible. The difference in these prices will be returned to the DAO.\n\nWe are excited about this new opportunity to keep creating nounish experiences IRL that can be replicated in other countries. But most of all, to spread the ⌐◨-◨ in a fun way!\n\n**Transactions**\nDue to the time sensitive nature of this proposal, NSFW has already funded NounsDAOAmigos to execute on this project.  The 23.25 ETH transaction in this proposal will go to refund NSFW.\n\n","proposer":"0x75Ee6eb3d8DAcf41eE2e5307090B197D3E1Cca6E","startBlock":15811106,"endBlock":15830816,"executed":true},"votes":[{"support":1,"voter":"0x67BaCe9bBdF3212509A7438AE026C7C9fBef6931","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":"Mono, Ale and the rest of the core team at Nouns DAO Amigos has done an incredible job since day 1.

Our own launch of Nouns DAO'n Under also serves as a [Nouns Builder](https://nouns.build) case study. \n\n### Noggles worn by event staff\n\nOur iconic noggles are wildly underutilised, especially in the context of collaborative branding and marketing opportunities.

We have collaborated with many high caliber clients in and out of web3 such as:\n\n[![](https://i.imgur.com/7kdbuvP.jpg)](https://vimeo.com/586628568)\n\n\n[Compound](https://www.behance.net/gallery/129713109/Compound-III) - Compound III is a collateralised borrowing protocol that optimizes capital efficiency, gas costs, and security.\n\n[![](https://i.imgur.com/ugBEZmu.jpg)](https://vimeo.com/715516917)\n\n[STL](https://www.behance.net/gallery/146273121/Smart-Token-Labs-TokenScript) - A revolutionary new Web3 technology designed to take Token Gating to the next level.\n\n[![](https://i.imgur.com/mjRPzlF.png)](https://vimeo.com/553216699)\n\n\n[Coinbase](https://www.behance.net/gallery/131256363/Coinbase) - Coinbase is the easiest place to buy and sell cryptocurrency, via a trusted and easy-to-use platform for accessing the broader crypto economy.\n\n[![](https://i.imgur.com/yeJCvDP.jpg)](https://vimeo.com/575631888)\n\n[Adobe Splash Screen](https://www.behance.net/gallery/129640141/Adobe-After-Effects) - Each year, Adobe commissions artists from a variety of disciplines and styles to show off the power of Creative Cloud by producing custom artwork to represent each product.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/auygyYd.png)\n\nWe at NeverSitStill encourage creative thinking  and personal development amongst the company,  which lead to a conversation about Nouns with motion designer [James Vallance (MrSEAKs)](https://twitter.com/SeaksMr). His collaboration earlier this year with Gnars DAO, and his work with Gami (Noun 189), to create an animated piece for NFT NYC proliferating Nouns. A major component of Nouns' participation in NFT NYC.\n\nSee more here: [Full video](https://create.zora.co/collections/0xdcbca59d38eb3abfcb5055fe7bd7f5ce027d03c3) | [Artist BTS & NY billboard footage](https://twitter.com/SeaksMr/status/1553862678795661312)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/8ja4qFe.png)\n\n## Proposal\n\n### What will we make for you?\n\nA 30-60 second, crafted hype video that represents Nouns in an exciting way. Exploring Nounish themes through visual metaphor, celebrating the culture with existing users, and onboarding the new.\n\nThink of it as an above-the-funnel video encapsulating the key themes of Nouns in a punchy, artistic, and fresh video to make people go WTF is Nouns?\n\nThe look and tone of the piece will be designed to capture attention, potentially becoming an ownable style for future Nouns advertising and messaging material. \n\nIt's a catalyst video to start the gravitational pull that is Nouns.\n\n### What is the video going to be about?\n\nThe video will represent strong themes that Nouns focuses on through visual metaphor:\n\n- Use case of NFTs for raising funds for positive change\n- Evolution and growth of Nouns\n- DAOs/community\n- Bootstrapping/launchpad\n- Interaction of Nouns and IRL, bringing the power of crypto to IRL\n\nWith these ideas at the core, we spin them into a powerful narrative that follows the birth of the Noggles and its exponential growth to become an object of power, one for positive change in the world.\n\nTo represent the multi-faceted nature of the Nouniverse, we intend to use a mixed-media approach, with input from various artists within our team. Distinct flavours coming together to create one visual style in a seamless video.\n\nWe feel this approach also carries the spirit of the Nouns DAO. A diverse pool of people building something great together.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/A0oZVgy.jpg)\n\n### The Nouniverse & Big Bang\n\nIn the beginning, at the centre of it all is the Noggle. The Noggle atom, molecule, cell, animal, vegetable, mineral. We want to place the Noggle at the centre of this big bang and follow the narrative of it's growing impact on the universe.\n\nThis rippling wave will take effect on the world around it, transforming and creating. What does the world look like through a Nounish lens?\n\n### Why hype video?\n\nThe current state of our fast-paced digital world needs information to be condensed into a highly digestible format to relay anything valuable.\n\n[Prop 143](https://nouns.wtf/vote/143) spoke to the fantastic concept of the video marketing funnel. To borrow a term from the Nounish team, we want to talk to the top of the funnel and go even more front-facing, above the funnel. This is why it’s important to create a first point of contact with broader audiences that inspires them to care about what they’re seeing. We want to ignite a spark within viewers to seek out and learn more about Nouns of their own volition.\n\nA hype video executes this perfectly. A short, visually rich video, presented in an artistic, eye-catching way, that grabs people's attention and hooks them in, down the Nouns rabbit hole.\n\n### Do traditional hype videos work in web3?\n\nIt’s well known that video is a perfect medium to promote and create awareness of a brand/product. Hype videos are a tool used by luxury brands within web2 and we want to bring these tried and tested methods to web3 and Nouns.\n\nTake the promo video for [Doodles v2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv9TaQ5z9jw), or the [Otherside](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1equGhkQE) Yuga Labs video. These are both great examples of highly crafted, short animated hype videos to blow up awareness of a brand/product to funnel new audiences into web3 and their brand.\n\nThese videos aren't about explaining how, but what and why.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/IbzEFzH.gif)\n\n### Video Lifespan\n\nA hype video has a long shelf life and is easy to re-use. Whenever you need promotional content, take an already existing hype video and place it at the front of marketing to interest viewers.\n\nCombine the re-usability of a hype video with assets that are CC0 and you have a piece of art that can be re-used, re-jigged, and a video that can live on for a long time.\n\nRender characters, assets, scenes, and the entire video as CC0 for all to share and spread Nouns proliferation.\n\n### Meta\n\nAir-drop current Noun owners their very own piece of this hype video in the form of NFTs created from scenes of the entire piece.

This stepped approach allows us to spend an appropriate amount of time in each phase, delivering top notch work in an efficient timeline. At each major milestone, our clients give condensed feedback to ensure that the work is communicating its message clearly.\n\nTo ensure the work is original and ownable, we use a period of time for high level research and development. This means we aren't aiming to re-create a reference, but build something new and ownable for the Nouns DAO.\n\n### Pre production\n\n- R&D (Community liaisons to guide content)\n- Concept art, thumbnails\n- Design, visual language development\n- Storyboarding\n- Animatic\n\n### Production\n\n- Animation\n- Music development\n- NFT + POAP creation\n\n### Post-Production\n\n- Compositing, Grading\n- Sound design\n- Mastering\n\n### Deliverables\n\n- Brand hype video (Widescreen 16:9, 4K, 30fps) [archival master + web ready]\n- Working files\n- NFT ready exports (TBD with community)\n- POAP artwork (TBD with community)\n\n### Production Schedule\n\nPre production to begin before EOY if approved.\n\nFull production starting no later than January 8th, taking approximately 10-12 weeks to complete the final piece.\n\n### Communications\n\nRegular updates and WIP process interaction with the Nouns community is important. We want to build in public and share progress openly.

[NounsOTG](https://nouns.wtf/vote/110) is partnering with the team at [Stoopid Buddy Studios](https://nouns.wtf/vote/73) for the [Rose Parade](https://tournamentofroses.com/) in Pasadena, CA after New Year's Day, to help Nouns reach an audience of over 38 Million individuals nationwide.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/HOT1b1T.jpg)\n\n\nWhat will this collaboration look like? NounsOTG will be working directly with the team at Stoopid Buddy in person on the ground for 10 days during this event. The Stoopid Buddy team has covered all build and production costs for the float during this event in [Proposal 73](https://nouns.wtf/vote/73). After multiple conversations discussing how this event could be further bolstered, Aubtoshi and NounsOTG have been asked to be a part of this event. NounsOTG plans on adding to the already-established effort that Prop 73 has put forth in the following ways:\n\n**10 Days of On The Ground Activations + Brand Ambassadors**\n\nAfter Christmas, all of the floats for the parade (which are being framed out and built off-site) are transported to their final location prior to the parade, which is where thousands of volunteers come to help decorate the floats with flowers. This time period will include full days of OTG (On The Ground) interviews, filming, activations with volunteers, activations with people who are waiting for the event to begin, and more. We will also be filming with the life-sized nounish “walk-arounds” (nouns costumes made by Stoopid Buddy, creators of costumes seen on the celebrity singing show “The Masked Singer”) during this time. Post-event, the floats will be staged in a different holding area to be observed and photographed one last time.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/5jlT56O.jpg)\n*Nounish \"Walk-Arounds\" by SB*\n\n\nAdditionally, NounsOTG will scout and hire 10 trained brand ambassadors that will be active the day before the parade, during the parade and afterwards, and at the Rose Bowl when handing out the mini limited edition footballs. The responsibilities of these ambassadors will include being on-brand, walking (waving, jumping, dancing) in a 5-mile parade line. We have allowed for the cost of their food and beverages during specific meal times, transportation to and from the event from the staging area, additional hours on the day prior during the final prep; as well as team meetings, zoom calls and fittings prior to the event, as we plan to deck them out in Nouns Brand and other nounish swag.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/sbu1t1L.png)\n\n**Special Guest DJ + Custom DJ Set On The Float + Over 18,000 Nounish Giveaways**\n\nThe DJ will be none other than **Richerd Intern**, and his crew will perform with a full/unique set during the live event! Although the parade float images are still not public or released, I can reveal that there will indeed be room for Richerd... \n\nHis team is London based and the cost comes directly from their team and includes their travel and accommodation. We couldn't be more nounish with the Noun266 (Chart Bars Noun head) if we tried!\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/JiJ5BwX.png)\n\nOver the course of 10 days, we will be handing out over 18,000 unique nounish items, including limited edition mini footballs and shirts, low-fi paper noggles, sticker packs and nouns temporary tattoos. Our goal is to get these items national television coverage during both the parade and rose bowl game. Noggles on the faces in the audience and children throwing nounish mini footballs would be a lasting image during this important holiday event. This opportunity has allowed OTG to connect to other nounish builders and we are open to further collaborations with Nouners and builders.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/jp42GOh.jpg)\n\n\n**Immediate Impact**\n\nIf you are unfamiliar with the Rose Parade or its impact, it is one of the major events of the year as the 5 mile parade ends with the start of the Rose Bowl football game. Outside of the 37 million viewers at home, the entire area of Southern California is focused on this event for several weeks prior!\n\nOver **1 Million people** will be in attendance on the day of the parade with a live broadcast to over 37 Million additional individuals nationwide. With a 5 mile parade line and an entire week of content creation and nounish item giveaways prior to the parade as the float is brought to completion, this will be one of the key proliferation event opportunities of the year for NounsDAO. Not to mention the day after the event sees 60-100k attendees that visit the floats to get a close up look at all the details - another amazing activation opportunity.   \n\n\n\n\n**Proposal Cost Breakdown**\n\nTotal ETH: 52, Total USDC: $78,000 *amount calculated with 1 ETH = $1,500 USD\n\n\n* 2.77 ETH: 250 Limited Edition Shirts (Nouns X Stoopid Buddy X Rose Parade)\n* 3.50 ETH: 5000 Stickers packs & 5000 Temporary Tattoos + Nounish MVPs for product placement\n* 5.65 ETH: Full custom DJ set by special guest DJ (includes Travel & Accommodation for their team)\n* 6.45 ETH: 10 Nouns Brand Ambassadors walking next to the parade and handing out items\n* 6.55 ETH: 250 Limited Edition Footballs (Nouns X Stoopid Buddy X Rose Parade)\n* 11.72 ETH: On-Site Coordination & Production Management: Aubtoshi & Emma & 2 PAs (10 days)\n* 14.84 ETH: Travel Costs & Accommodation & Staging Area for Items (10 days)\n* 0.00 ETH: 7000 Lo-fi Paper Noggles (Send purchase order to NSFW, no additional funding needed)\n* 0.52 ETH: Fees to cover for multi-sig transactions outlined below\n\nTo account for any ETH volatility during the time this prop goes through the voting process, we are adding an additional 10 ETH to this prop. After the initial conversion to USDC, any extra eth from this 10 ETH will be immediately sent back to the DAO. Additionally, any ETH left from the Travel Costs & Accommodation budget will also be sent back to the DAO.\n**Total ETH amount requested from NounsDAO: 62 ETH**\n\nAll funds will be held in a multi-sig wallet that will initiate the following transactions:\n* Convert ETH to $78,000 USDC ($780 for txn fees)\n* Send any remaining ETH back to the NounsDAO\n* $3,395 USDC: Sent to PA1 for on-site production assistance during 10 days\n* $3,395 USDC: Sent to PA2 for on-site production assistance during 10 days\n* $5,395 USDC: Sent to Aubtoshi for production coordination payment\n* $5,395 USDC: Sent to Emma for production coordination payment \n* $8,475 USDC: Sent to DJ + team upon confirmation of their booking and release forms collected\n* $9,405 USDC: Sent to OTG to order Stickers, Temporary Tattoos and Shirts\n* $9,675 USDC: Sent to OTG to have payment ready for OTG Brand Ambassadors\n* $9,825 USDC: Sent to VSVSVS to order limited edition footballs\n* $22,260 USDC: Sent to OTG to book travel/accommodation/food/additional costs\n\n**The multisig (2/3) signers are:** \n\n[**Aubtoshi**](https://nounsagora.com/delegate/aubtoshi.%E2%8C%90%E2%97%A8-%E2%97%A8)\n[**Toady Hawk**](https://nounsagora.com/delegate/toadyhawk.%E2%8C%90%E2%97%A8-%E2%97%A8) \n**Nounder 9999**\n\n\n**Long-Term Value**\n\nStoopid Buddy has been actively engaged in the community and are clearly delivering on their prop. Outside of creating a successful experience at the event itself, footage from the event will be used in the documentary outlined in [Proposal 73](https://nouns.wtf/vote/73). I have been to the studio in Burbank, I have met the walk-around craftsman and have been trusted by the Stoopid Buddy team to see confidential alpha from their News Years Event and participate in production conversations leading up to it. \n\nThis additional push to create a nounish experience and vibe during the event will connect Nouns directly with all the many people in attendance, plus brand new audiences at home. **While the SB crew are focused on long form video for their documentary, this proposal will allow me and my team to supplement that content with visceral and viral short-form content perfect for social media. All our content will of course be made CC0 and available for future use, ensuring that the DAO's investment in this event is documented and that our brand is seen and experienced by an even broader audience than those reached by the documentary and broadcasts alone.** \n\nProp 73 will go down as one of the most successful funded proposals to date for NounsDAO, not only for its reach and high quality production, but for real nounish interaction with so many real people. I feel honored to have been asked by SB to help with the on-site activation piece for the Rose Bowl Parade, to ensure that our Nouns national television coverage has the best visuals possible with lasting effects. I look forward to the opportunity to bring this NounsOTG activation to life!\n","proposer":"0x5D802e2Fe48392c104Ce0401C7ECa8a4456f1F16","startBlock":15862088,"endBlock":15898088,"executed":true},"votes":[{"support":1,"voter":"0x3993996B09949BBA655d98C02c87EA6ABf553630","numberOfVotes":2,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x8BecD7EbF3F910090f9264DFD0Bb221Ea04af8c3","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x86030dbbCe1c771Ff6622C20455cd3619aa93c05","numberOfVotes":50,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0xdB7f66F3D53A6A0EC43a49C7B6713e1bd3bd1383","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x5ca6a2e5f53a48616d4ead87fF6034fc032D4722","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":"Aubtoshi promised me a son if I voted for this."},{"support":1,"voter":"0x387a161C6b25aA854100aBaED39274e51aaffffd","numberOfVotes":2,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x0C66d954d9cb1ebDF4E37a000262323C83655e70","numberOfVotes":2,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0xb8a9Ed8D008FA1F161809f15a11F4161FB8b717e","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0xA002C3a0c7eb9330C5b21cF3BEC7fd1A7FA0bEFE","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0xCF4e26a7e7eAe4b3840dd31C527096e1265AB990","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":"Aubtoshi with Nouns OTG and SB out here doing amazing things! \n\nThis proposal is jam-packed with value for the DAO and displayed as such.

Instead of giving all power and capital solely to a project’s founders, the Nouns model enables communities to emerge progressively, and to be active participants in how their brand and community evolves.\n\nWe believe that more Nouns forks should exist - so we’re building a tool anyone can use to build them.\n\nFor the past couple of months we have been working on the Nouns Builder: a product that makes it easy for anyone to create their own Nouns DAO with any art, any auction cadence and flexible DAOs that can evolve over time.\n\nAs we’ve been building this tool, we’ve increasingly realized that it makes sense to use this very tool to create a DAO that will govern, sustain and develop the Nouns Builder project itself. By doing so, Nouns builder can:\n* Demonstrate the utility of Nouns Builder as a public good\n* Utilize the ecosystem of tools in Nouns: Prop House, Agora\n* Experiment using the NounsDAO model as an alternative to the subDAO multisig\n* Experiment using the NounsDAO model to proliferate a protocol and products\n* Expand use of the NounsDAO model as a more effective governance model for collective decision making\n* Share governance of this DAO with Nouns, Zora, and future contributors as interested in expanding the horizon of this public infrastructure as we are. \n\nWe are going to call this DAO “Builder”, with its own art and NFT that will be minted each day. Builder will be NounsDAO from day 1, with the goal of proliferating this infrastructure.\n\n**Core details to note:**\n\n* Based on extensive feedback from the Nouns community, the protocol is entirely free. There is currently no protocol wide fee.\n* DAOs can opt in to gift a certain amount of their NFTs to Nouns or any other DAO or platform\n* In prior versions of the proposal, we proposed that NounsDAO would be the deployer of the Builder DAO. Based on feedback from the community we have removed this aspect of the proposal.\n* The protocol development has been extensive, with careful consideration made to\n    * Enable DAOs to easily upgrade and evolve themselves over time in a safe manner\n    * Be gas efficient\n    * Open up room for exploration around new distribution types like VRGDAs\n* The protocol has been audited via Code4rena, with Zora paying $129K USDC ($90k in prizes) to complete it.\n* We have built an easy to use tool at [nouns.build](https://nouns.build) where over 60 testnet DAOs have been created in the process of testing and refining the user experience.\n\n**Ask:**\n\n1000 ETH contribution to seed the Nouns Builder DAO treasury to help this public good reach its full potential. \n\n\n**Completed Work:**\n\nRather than requesting retroactive reward for development, ***we are asking NounsDAO to pay it forward* by seeding the Builder treasury with ETH** for funding the development of the Nouns Builder protocol as a public good and expansion of the ecosystem by the community. \n\nZora contributed ~4 months of development time on creating the Nouns Builder protocol\n* Full time contributions from the Zora solidity, backend, and front end engineering teams\n* Full time design and creative direction for Nouns Builder artworks.\n* ~100 ETH spent on the Code4rena audit.\n\nThis contribution to the Nouns Builder DAO treasury means there is sufficient Day 1 capital to immediately conduct prop house mandates and funding rounds for the development, proliferation, and accessibility of the protocol and ecosystem for the benefit of the public.\n\n**Deliverables:**\n* Audited Nouns Builder smart contracts.\n* Custom Nouns Builder generative artwork (CC0).\n* Builder DAO for anyone in the community to join and contribute.\n\n**All of the ETH will be going to the Nouns Builder DAO treasury.**\n\n**Builder DAO:**\n\nThe Builder DAO is created using the Nouns Builder tool and protocol. It is the entity onchain that will be responsible for funding the proliferation of the ecosystem and development of the protocol over time. \n\nWe believe Nouns Builder represents critical public infrastructure for community decision making, and we want to use the full power of the NounsDAO model to further this protocol and ecosystem of different apps built on top of it, as well as being able to natively tap into tools in the ecosystem like Prop House and Agora.\n\nBuilderDAO creators will receive the following governance rights in the Builder DAO for a period of 5 years after Builder DAO’s launch to allow the creators to support of the growth and development of this public good while in its nascency:\n* 1/10 to zora.eth\n* 1/20 to nouns.eth\n\nFor clarity, DAO members shall not receive any revenues from Builder DAO daily auctions. All funds in the Treasury shall be dedicated to improving the Builder DAO protocol and its public good function, and growing the community, brand, and ecosystem. \n\nThe Builder DAO will start with a daily auction. The NFTs that will be minted each day are a nounish artwork that expands on the ideas of “Internet flags”, a collection of unicode symbols that communities can organize around, with the nounish colors at its core, as well as the noggles.\n\nHere is a sample of the codex below:\n![](https://i.imgur.com/kArgmJn.png)\n\n\n**NounsDAOs for Public Infrastructure:**\n\nWe believe it is important to experiment with Nouns forks as a way to further particular pieces of infrastructure within the nounish ecosystem. Instead of funded LLCs and companies to ultimately manage tools like Nouns Builder and things like Prop House, we want to actively explore using a Nounish DAO as the primary entity to further a public protocol and an ecosystem of many platforms built on top of it. \n\nThis is why we are leading from the front with the Builder DAO. We are also optimistic that this can become a blueprint for any team that is developing protocols—like Zora itself. \n\n**Sustainability:**\n\nIn prior proposals there have been open questions around the future models for sustainability without need for persistent funding from NounsDAO all the time. We believe that this is the first meaningful step in this direction, and we hope to set a precedent and blueprint for future teams to build sustainable Public Infrastructure that is native to the Nouns ecosystem and DAO itself.\n\n**Transaction Details:**\n\n1000 ETH transferred to an escrow smart contract that will hold the funds until the Builder DAO is live and operational. We are expecting this to be live on approximately November 15th.\n\n**References:**\n[Discourse post](https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/proposal-nouns-builder-draft/2007)\n[Prop house](https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/prop-house-protocol-public-infrastructure-by-nouns-dao/1594)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/yPwwE6T.jpg)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/M31ZnVx.png)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/GLLYhTu.jpg)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","proposer":"0xd1d1D4e36117aB794ec5d4c78cBD3a8904E691D0","startBlock":15891023,"endBlock":15927023,"executed":true},"votes":[{"support":1,"voter":"0xd1d1D4e36117aB794ec5d4c78cBD3a8904E691D0","numberOfVotes":20,"reason":""},{"support":0,"voter":"0x5ca6a2e5f53a48616d4ead87fF6034fc032D4722","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":"Plenty of forks exist, this tool is only to bring the lowest effort forks into being.

All other large scale, long-term projects/pods have started small and demonstrated demand before asking for outsized funding (See [Prop House Protocol: Public Infrastructure by Nouns DAO](https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/prop-house-protocol-public-infrastructure-by-nouns-dao/1594) as cited in this proposal). Builder currently has no metrics to match the size of this ask.\n\nThe Zora team should decide which approach to take.

(This can be the same person and message or different people and messages)\n*   The episode must be on Mr. Beasts main YouTube channel.\n*   The Nouns must be featured on the show for any of the funds to be paid out.\n\nSo it might be a good idea for people to submit ideas to Mr. Beast that inspires him to meet these criteria. \n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n\n## **TOTAL COST**\nIf this proposal passes but no one can convince Mr. Beast to take on and complete the project within the next 9 months – all the Eth will be returned to the Treasury. **Total Cost of 0 Eth.**\n\nIf this proposal passes and someone is successful in convincing Mr. Beast to feature the Nouns in the most watched show on the internet while hopefully giving a lot of money away to good causes it will have a **Total Cost of 500 Eth.**\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n\n## **WHY MR. BEAST?**\nHe is the most watched person on the internet (with over 100m subscribers and up to 300m views on his videos), so I think Nouns featuring on his show would bring awareness to Nouns, NFTs, DAOs and Ethereum to millions. In doing so, it will allow people to see the great creative initiatives that Nouns are working on and have funded (e.g.[73](https://nouns.wtf/vote/73))  as well as charities it has supported (e.g. [104](https://nouns.wtf/vote/104) ,[42](https://nouns.wtf/vote/42) ). On top of this I would hope it will showcase the ability of a decentralised network of people to raise funds and successfully deploy those funds in innovative ways that leverages its community to make big things happen!\n\nMr. Beast already has a good awareness of crypto and he has a history of giving to charity at a large scale too so hopefully he will be able to bring awareness to all of this in a thoughtful, considered, and fun way.\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n\n## **A $250k REWARD … THAT IS A LOT OF MONEY!?**\nI can imagine some Nouners balking at the $250k prize being paid to whoever can convince Mr. Beast to take on this challenge, which is understandable.\n\nMy goal is to create value for the DAO and while one could argue that people will take on this challenge for a smaller amount – we just don’t know if it would be _as_ effective and ultimately it will always be a guess as to what the _right_ figure is.\n\nThe goal is to mobilise 99.9% of the internet and get them interested in making this happen through the incentive of a big reward. And while no one can be certain of the exact figure that would be most effective, what I _do_ know is that $250k has a high chance of success. It will advertise itself by getting people talking about it and it will massively increase the chances of the challenge being accepted. I believe we would rather potentially pay more to increase the chances of success.\n\nWhile it is a lot of money, I think it presents extremely good value. Price is what you pay and value is what you get. If no one can make it happen, nothing gets paid out and the price is zero. But if someone does make it happen, a $750k price to have the Nouns featured on the most watched show on the internet will provide great value.\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n\n## **WHAT DO I GET FROM THIS?**\nNothing\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n\n**Terms and Conditions**\n*   Transfer will be made to the prize winner after the video has aired on YouTube.\n*   Mr. Beast cannot refer himself as the person to win the prize.\n*   If Mr. Beast decides to do the show but does not (or can not) identify the person or message that convinced him to take it on - the $250k will be put into a prop house round where $50k will be awarded to 5 charities as voted on by Nouners.\n*   The $500k (340 Eth) will be transferred from the multisig to Mr. Beast upon written agreement between the parties.\n*   For the interest of transparency and to avoid conflicts of interest: I am not Mr. Beast nor do I have any affiliation with him in any way. If (somehow) it is me or this proposal that convinces him to do the challenge or to do it for charity, I will pledge the prize fund to charity and no Nounder will be eligible to win this prize.\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n\n**Funds**\nIf the proposal passes, Eth to the equivalent of $750k will be converted to USDC to fund the challenge and any excess will be returned to the treasury. \n\nThe funds will remain in the multisig until either the challenge is accepted or converted back to Eth and returned to the treasury after 9 months if the challenge is not accepted.\n\nThe funds will be held in a 2 / 3 Multisig with the signatures being:\n\n*   Hindsight - [Twitter](https://twitter.com/0Hindsight) - [Agora](https://www.nounsagora.com/delegate/0xhindsight.eth)\n*   Jarmen - [Twitter](https://twitter.com/jarmen43)\n*   Sam Ellis - [Twitter](https://twitter.com/manofmissle) - [Agora](https://www.nounsagora.com/delegate/thepencil.%E2%8C%90%E2%97%A8-%E2%97%A8)","proposer":"0x55b0a25d697647281553a177321DAd0a0Bf9A148","startBlock":15926193,"endBlock":15962193,"executed":false},"votes":[{"support":1,"voter":"0x1e66a3D0a6A327b1F29e8ACf3a3d9E1E4E088683","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":"When asked what he thought 'Nounish' meant 4156 said \"do good with no expectation of return, create positive externalities, embrace absurdity & difference, teach people about nouns & crypto, have fun\"\n\nWe hope all of you think this is a Nounish Proposal"},{"support":1,"voter":"0x55b0a25d697647281553a177321DAd0a0Bf9A148","numberOfVotes":2,"reason":"When asked what he thought 'Nounish' meant 4156 said \"do good with no expectation of return, create positive externalities, embrace absurdity & difference, teach people about nouns & crypto, have fun\"\n\nWe hope all of you think this is a Nounish proposal"},{"support":1,"voter":"0x9a2F6117D1FFa82ad0A2B36f133d476DB5bD55F5","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x49a8B75F1C76fCd7a9F51180F5E6C286C2EE284c","numberOfVotes":0,"reason":""},{"support":0,"voter":"0x70eCe45cDc64A768f936Ccb8aC851578251363e3","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":"This proposal does not demonstrate an understanding of Mr. Beast's video process.

The first in the pipeline is a nounish NNS version of EtherScan. \n* Launch the Nounish Club project to push proliferation in and outside the Nouniverse through a new experiment of community reward and participation.\n* Create a full documentation for end-users and developers expanding the ways in which they can integrate the NNS in their projects.\n* Start the first experiments and collaborations for Phase 3.\n\n**Requesting** funding of 195 ETH to execute our Expansion Phase.\n\nFunds will be immediately converted in USDC to avoid volatility exposure of any kind.\n\n[![NNS-proposal-artwork-2.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/yd7g5qPr/NNS-proposal-artwork-2.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/SXtx2vHW)\n\n## How the NNS started\nThe idea of the NNS originated from a question:\n \n*“Is there a way to transform a meme icon into a fully functional domain, where its utility grows proportionally to the meme adoption?”*\n \nDuring the first months of work, this idea evolved from its very first draft on Prop House, letting the NNS become a possible solution to several interesting scenarios:\n \n* In an ecosystem based on CC0 like the Nouniverse, with a lot of new communities and sub-DAOs, the .⌐◨-◨ could become a universal tool for companies and creators to interact with the entire ecosystem at once.\n***How so?***\nThe power of a CC0 ecosystem is the proliferation of a main idea in many sub-projects and communities. In the Nouniverse, that idea is represented by the ⌐◨-◨ meme. The noggles appear in every nounish community, but at the same time they are part of different NFTs and collections. At the moment, there isn’t a token that can unify the Nouns ecosystem at an infrastructural level. The .⌐◨-◨ can fill this gap, allowing companies and creators to reach the whole ecosystem by simply integrating the NNS into their token-gated experiences and initiatives.\n\n* The more the NNS is integrated on new apps and marketplaces across the world, the more the .⌐◨-◨  will help spread the nounish culture at an exponential level.\n***How so?***\nThe NNS serves as an on-chain identity badge for all the people who share the nounish culture. Having your .⌐◨-◨  attached to your web3 identity makes it clear that you belong to the “nounish internet society”. The more the NNS will expand, the more the Nouns proliferation will reach places that wouldn’t even have been considered before.\n\n* In a market dominated by 2 titan projects and few TLDs, the NNS could become the first experiment of a collaborative naming system on ETH. This would allow other communities to join the NNS and create their own TLD on top of the NNS, making the whole protocol stronger and more widely adopted, and offering the new communities the advantage of having their TLD natively resolved across the NNS network from day 1. \n***How so?***\nOnce the Nouns Name Service is globally recognised by important apps in the space, it could open its network to other communities as well. This way, communities will not only get their customized TLD (that’s nothing new), but this will be able to be natively resolved everywhere from the very beginning. This will literally onboard in the Nouniverse and in Nouns DAO whole communities made by end-users and talented builders, constantly bringing new ideas and improving engagement thanks to a proven system of funding based on Prop House, Small Grants and all the other nounish DAOs.\n\n**In a nutshell,** for a community joining the NNS would mean not only having a naming infrastructure, but also being able to build and nurture important relationships in the Nouniverse that will push new ideas and collaborations with the entire ecosystem.\n\nThese applications, which at the moment represent our focus, will offer Nouns and the Nouniverse an important value in terms of proliferation, new users in existing nounish platforms and the attraction of new builders.\n\nAnd we are confident this is just the beginning of many other applications for the NNS.\n\n[![Nouns-Name-Service-NNS-works.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/CKSxMGqR/Nouns-Name-Service-NNS-works.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/bZVh32LP)\n\n## Roadmap (The 3 Phases)\nBuilding this kind of Naming System is a big task. Which is why we split our development in 3 Phases. After the first one is completed, the NNS will be able to move to the next one, and so on.\n\n### PHASE 1: Core Ecosystem and Community\nThe power of any protocol lies in its network.\nThat’s why our top priority since launch has always been to build a strong core ecosystem from which we can expand.\n\nWhile new naming systems often rely on external plugins to resolve their names, the NNS aims to create a network where every NNS name is natively resolved without any additional action by the users.\n \nAt the time of writing, the NNS has been supported by all the major nounish projects, officially connecting the Nouniverse. \n\n[![Nouns-Name-Service-NNS-projects.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/SNcXyNvt/Nouns-Name-Service-NNS-projects.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/RNVCd99c)\n \n**ENS reservation period and stats:** \n\nDuring the first 60 days after launch NNS names could only be claimed by their correspondent .eth.\n \nWhile this impacted the NNS growth in the very short term, it also allowed the early adopters to have full control of their identities, thus focusing more on identity than speculation.\n\nThe ENS reservation ended on 19 October 2022 with the following results:\n\n* 355 names claimed\n* 252 unique owners\n \nAs you’re reading this, after 4 months of development and 2 months of Reservation Period, Phase 1 is officially completed.\n\nAt this time, 2 weeks after the end of the Reservation Period, a total of 526 .⌐◨-◨  names have been registered from 311 unique owners.\n\n[![nns-launch-artwork.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/KvH4WgjG/nns-launch-artwork.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/mt7bzk7J)\n\n### PHASE 2: Expansion and Nounish Club\n\nPhase 2 will start the real proliferation of the NNS.\n\nAs mentioned in the TL;DR, the Expansion phase will have several goals, starting from the integration of the NNS in new DAOs, apps and marketplaces outside the Nouns ecosystem, also solving the .⌐◨-◨ current copy-paste issue. \n\nPart of the Expansion will also be the building of an NNS Scan, which you can picture like an NNS version of EtherScan. We will also create a new and more complete website, where end-users and developers will be able to access a full documentation so that they can find new ways to integrate the NNS in their projects. \n\nThe NNS Squad will also have access to an experimental Treasury which will be used to reward active members and finance new missions.\n\nFinally, and what we believe is the most exciting part of this Phase, we will launch the Nounish Club project to push proliferation through an experimental form of community reward and participation. \n\nAt the end of these developments, we will start the first experiments and collaborations for Phase 3. \n\n### The Nounish Club \n\nThe Nounish Club is an experiment made to reward nouners, nounish projects and communities outside the Nouniverse through new forms of community participation.\n \nThe idea is to allocate to this initiative all the numbers from 0 to 9999.⌐◨-◨, making them a new coveted asset to stimulate NNS proliferation and inspire new community ideas.\n\nHowever, these numbers won't be available to be bought from the NNS.\n\nThey will only be earnable by taking active part in .⌐◨-◨ proliferation and in special initiatives, and they will be entirely distributed for free through what we like to call a “Proof of Proliferation” process. \n\nThe Nounish Club will be an exclusive group inside the NNS, completely in the hands of the Nouniverse.\n \nEvery nounish project will be able to add a special benefit to the club, such as discounts, NFTs, voting power, early accesses and more. They will also be able to ask the NNS to get a specific allocation of numbers to be shared among their communities or to be used as assets to keep in their treasury.\n \nThe more benefits will be added, the more the access to the Nounish Club will be valued.\n\nHere are some key points of how this would work:\n\n* The NNS will allocate an initial amount of numbers to the NNS Squad DAO created through Nouns Builder. This will add an additional asset to the treasury that will be managed according to DAO voting.\n* For the first 6 months, the numbers from 0 to 669 will be reserved for Nouners. Every existing nouner, as well as new ones, can request their specific numbers offering their help to proliferate the Nouns Name Service or to add benefits to make the Nounish Club more valuable. \n* Specific numbers would be used to invite new strategic users into the Nouns ecosystem.\n* Nounish DAOs and projects would be able to request a certain allocation of numbers for proliferation initiatives. This will make the distribution of the Nounish Club more and more decentralized.\n* If the experimental allocation to the NNS Squad DAO is successful, the NNS will gradually allocate a bigger amount of numbers to the DAO over time. \n\nThe Nounish Club benefits will be grouped on a url like nounishclub.wtf and new proposals about ideas, benefits and allocations can be managed through the NNS Squad DAO and discussed on the NNS Discord.\n\nThe Nounish Club will also use Prophouse as another important tool to generate and reward new ideas.\n\n#### Why the Nounish Club?\n\nWe are exploring what the NNS can become through a continuous loop of never-tried before experiments and feedback. The Nounish Club is one of them.\n\nThe reason we are excited about the Nounish Club is that we believe it can be an interesting experiment which, if successful, will be able to create a massive value for every community in the Nouns ecosystem.\n\nThis value can be seen as:\n\n* **Building value:** It will be a further incentive for nounish communities to build cool things for the NNS and the Nounish Club.\n* **Proliferation value:** It will generate a further proliferation of the .⌐◨-◨  and can be used to onboard strategic users into the Nouns ecosystem.\n* **Economic value:** The more the NNS and the Nounish Club will grow, the more every name of the Club will be valuable (incentivizing more building around it).\n\n[![NNSproposal-artwork3.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/90rG85XH/NNSproposal-artwork3.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/hQRzvY72)\n\n### PHASE 3: Protocol\n\nOnce the NNS is supported by the major platforms in the space and successfully completes all the other tasks, it will be ready to open the protocol to other communities.\n \nThis upgrade will allow other great projects to build their TLD on top of the Nouns Name Service.\n \nThis will strengthen the relationship between the Nouniverse and worldwide communities working together for the proliferation of the Nouns Name Service.\n \nDwelling on the developments of Phase 3 is not the focus of this proposal, which aims to focus on the Expansion and Phase 2. However, our ultimate mission is making Nouns the center of a naming revolution that will attract not only end users, but also companies and other big projects.\n \nSome aspects of Phase 3 are still being brainstormed and we can’t wait to share more details with the community when they’ll be ready.\n\n## FUNDS\n\n### Personal context for full transparency from Dom (@dotnouns)\n\nBesides the 2 ETH received from Prop House in April, all the NNS development was bootstrapped.\n\nAs a founder and a true believer in the NNS, since the end of May I decided to commit 90% of my time on the project, gradually reducing the personal clients I was following in my day job.\n \nIf this can seem a hazard to many, burning the bridges that could act as a way out allowed the project to be laser focused on execution and allowed the NNS to become what it is today.\n \nThe goal of this proposal is helping the NNS to build a starting fund that will push the development and the proliferation with the same laser focus that has characterized Phase 1.\n\n### The request in a nutshell\n\nWe are requesting 195 ETH to scale the NNS, fully complete Phase 2 and begin experiments for Phase 3 as well.\n\nFunds will be immediately converted in USDC to avoid volatility of any kind.\n\n### How the funds will be used\n\nThe funding from this proposal will serve to develop the following areas, which will be crucial for the long-term success:\n \n·  \t**Expand the team** and hire top professionals for specific tasks or projects. In particular, main focus will be given to external integrations and community building.\n·  \t**Design a website** that will offer more support to end users and developers. This will include an extensive tech documentation and FAQ section.\n·  \t**Create a DAO for the NNS Squad through Nouns Builder.** The DAO treasury will be used to coordinate proliferation actions among members and to manage the allocation of numbers for the Nounish Club.\n·  \t**Create an NNS House on Prop House** focused on building new products for the NNS ecosystem, the Nounish Club and developing new integrations with important partners.\n·  \t**Push proliferation** in and outside the Nouns ecosystem through the Nounish Club.\n·  \t**Add a new .nouns TLD** that will help overcome .⌐◨-◨ copy-paste problems on external apps, thus making its applications more flexible and effective. \n\n### Thoughts about the .⌐◨-◨  copy-paste “issue”\n\nOne frequent objection about the .⌐◨-◨  is that noggles are not easy to type on the keyboard. This is indisputably true.\n\nThe .⌐◨-◨  is first of all an identity badge of the Nouniverse. That’s why it’s natively resolved on all the nounish platforms without any effort or action by the user.\n\nEven if every tool built around the NNS would make writing the .⌐◨-◨ easy as a click, to expand the applications of the Nouns Name Service we are also exploring the creation of a .nouns TLD.\nThis domain would ease the integration of the NNS in several apps (especially wallets) and would unlock interesting additional applications.\n\nIn the future, NNS users would be able to connect all their NNS names to this core extension and from their dashboard they could decide how they want to appear in their favorite communities.\n\nThis development is still in brainstorming mode, but we wanted to share it to give some context about our initial focus and what we’re going to work on next.\n\n### Milestones and funding release\n\nIn an effort to show our commitment and laser focus in the NNS mission, we decided to divide the funding allocation in 2 tranches.\n\nThe first 97.5 ETH will be unlocked upfront and will cover the first 3 months.\nIn particular, during this period we will: \n\n* Launch and proliferate the Nounish Club project and its DAO\n* Release the new website with a full documentation\n* Complete the first new integrations with projects outside the Nouns ecosystem\n* Start the first experiments with the .nouns extension. (If everything works smoothly we will be able to release it during the first 3 months, otherwise it will be launched in month 4.)\n\nThe list only refers to the goals highlighted in this proposal and doesn't include actions that will be part of the ordinary proliferation strategy of the NNS, such as community initiatives, viral actions and collabs with other projects in and outside the Nouns ecosystem.\n\nAt the end of the first 3 months, these milestones will be checked and verified by nouns community members Toady Hawk and Benbodhi.\n\nIf this first Milestone Check is successful, the second and last part of the funding will be released.\n\n### Multisig Wallet\n\nFunds will be managed through a Gnosis multisig wallet (2/3) with the following trusted signers:\n\n* [Dotnouns](https://twitter.com/dotnouns) (NNS)\n* [Toady Hawk](https://nounsagora.com/delegate/toadyhawk.%E2%8C%90%E2%97%A8-%E2%97%A8) (Proposal Sponsor and Milestones Checker)\n* [Benbodhi](https://nounsagora.com/delegate/benbodhi.%E2%8C%90%E2%97%A8-%E2%97%A8) (Milestone Checker)\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThis is what the Nouns Name Service is right now, and what it could become.\n\nWe realize it’s an ambitious vision, and that there might be challenges and many things we didn’t predict, as for every venture in unexplored waters. \n\nHowever, ever since the beginning, we’ve tried to earn the community’s trust. We are now fully committing ourselves to something that could be extremely beneficial for the Nouns ecosystem in the long term.\n\n**If you believe in this project, we ask you to consider supporting this proposal, so that we can together build the future of the Nouns Name Service!**\n\n","proposer":"0x5D802e2Fe48392c104Ce0401C7ECa8a4456f1F16","startBlock":15978444,"endBlock":16014444,"executed":true},"votes":[{"support":1,"voter":"0x8BecD7EbF3F910090f9264DFD0Bb221Ea04af8c3","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x538C4F2AfA012911851dAdf0655cb61377e7a8EB","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":"Would love to see more devs on the team.

Since winning that round (2 ETH), I have seen him work so hard to set up and roll out the .⌐◨-◨  network and identities that many of us love and use every day. \n\nHe has also reached out to every corner of the nouniverse to make sure .⌐◨-◨ is natively resolved almost anywhere you want to interact, from nouns.wtf and Agora to basically any nounish auction site you can think of. \n\nHe built all this foundation nearly for free, almost seven months of blood, sweat and tears for a couple ETH. Now he is asking the DAO to believe in the potential of the network and his plans for it, and I think it’s a worthwhile endeavor to give him some funding and runway to do so. \n\nPhase 2 is all about proliferation of the .nouns (NNS) network and I think the planned 3-pronged approach of 1) continuing to integrate more communities to resolve . ⌐◨-◨ natively, 2) running social media campaigns and the Nounish Club initiative to make nns names more desirable and 3) seeding/spinning up a DAO with Nouns builder to create a flywheel of community proliferation using Prop House and other methods to reward community members who help spread the .⌐◨-◨ meme, is a powerful strategy to get as many nounish people as possible using this network daily (and therefore proliferating nouns across web3.) \n\nNouns will never have a token like $APE and I don’t think it ever needs one. But absent that, I think .⌐◨-◨ is a really cool and low-friction way to unite communities all over the nouniverse, and I’m looking forward to seeing what Dom and team can do with some ETH and a little runway. \n\nAlso, if the team does NOT knock this out of the part with their efforts in the first 3 months, Benbodhi and I have the right and obligation as multisig signers / milestone checkers to send the second half of the funds back to the DAO instead of releasing them. I of course don’t expect this to be necessary, but it does nonetheless lessen the outlay risk in my opinion, if you trust our judgment.   \n\nI was happy to support Dom by sponsoring this prop on chain after seeing all his work on NNS to date, and happy to vote yes here.

Focused primarily on the sectors of software, arts and IRL with a funding range between 8-25Ξ, our goal is to help builders with a track record scale up within the Nouns ecosystem.\n\n## Overview ##\n\nThere currently exists a large gap within the current Nouns funding landscape that creates challenges for Nounish builders in the ecosystem. \n\nOn the lower end of the spectrum, there are many options for builders to seek funding for <10Ξ, between NSFW, Prop House, and a number of subDAO efforts (Gnars, SharkDAO, Lil Nouns, etc). On the higher end, there is virtually no limit as we have seen on-chain props go to $1M and beyond.\n\nHowever, in between these two points there is a gap that continues to grow as we see NSFW, Prop House, and subDAOs prefering to run more experiments with smaller amounts, all the while prominent Nouners are increasingly calling for the DAO to scale upward and not consider on-chain props lower than 20Ξ.\n\nThis places builders in a tough spot where they must figure out how to take their concept from point A to point B to achieve escape velocity. This issue is further exacerbated by the closure of the official Nouns Discord server, which will make it harder for the DAO to reach consensus on on-chain props as a governing body.\n\nDCS will focus on working with these builders who have \"graduated\" from one of the off-chain funding programs and provide them with bridge funding and guidance as they work towards the goal of passing a larger scale on-chain prop with the broader DAO base.\n\nSaid a different way, we help builders **Do Cool Sh*t**.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/pMkWTM2.png)\n\n## Pod Details ##\n\nDCS pod members will leverage their Nounish network and experience to guide and work with builders to ensure their further success in the DAO. DCS will act as a working group to ensure our funded builders are provided more than just capital but an active group to collaborate with and build alongside.\n\n**The pod plays a key role in four ways:**\n\n- Creates a stepping stone for off-chain \"graduates\" on their journey to larger on-chain props, both in terms of financial support and guidance in refining their project\n- Provides accountability and additional data points for the broader DAO to consider when the resulting props go on-chain\n- Emphasizes a transparent decision making framework that is data-driven and scalable\n- Actively works with builders to ensure their further success in the DAO by being a source of active support and guidance helping them move through the roadblocks and challenges they face\n\n**What areas will the pod focus on?**\n\nDCS will focus on key areas where we feel we can provide the most value and help ideas scale quickly. Given the subject matter expertise and experience of pod members, the following areas are our initial focus: \n\n- **Software** - dApps, smart contracts, mobile apps, gaming\n- **Arts & Content** - artists, musicians, video and content creators\n- **IRL** - local/regional activations, events, and other on-the-ground efforts\n\n\n**How will the group operate?**\n\n- Props (sourced from off-chain funding programs) will be be submitted to the pod online\n- Prop will be discussed on weekly DCS calls\n- Prop will be voted on in the DCS Discord\n\nWe will work with the operators of the various off-chain funding program to raise visibility for DCS as a \"next step\" for graduates. We will use Prop House and/or [AddressBoard](https://www.addressform.io/) to receive formal funding requests, so we can ensure proper data collection throughout the process for the DAO.\n\nThe pod will convene once a week on an open call to discuss what has been submitted since the last meeting and to discuss additional pipeline developments. These calls will be available to the community. This will foster discussion about props, help engage with builders and elevate the quality of props that get funded. Emphasis will be placed on data-driven processes to ensure greater builder accountability and proper measurement of ROI back to the DAO.\n\nAfter discussion, pod members will decide which props will be funded by voting on a dedicated Discord channel (or via Prop House platform).\n\nPod members are required to attend weekly meetings and actively give feedback on props. Pod members can be removed and replaced based on participation (which will be decided by the remaining members of the pod). Pod members will be rotated every 3-6 months in order to spread knowledge, boost decentralization and to ensure the pod is not overly reliant on any single member.

As soon as the rest of the USDC is available, it is sent to the recipient's wallet, no user intervention needed. We expect this to take a few days at most, depending on the total amount.\n\nTokenBuyer allows anyone to swap USDC for the ETH it holds. It uses Chainlink's ETH/USD price feed to set the price.\n\nWhenever a proposal requests USDC from the DAO, it will also include a transaction to top up TokenBuyer with additional ETH, proportional to the USDC amount requested.\n\n(*This \"automatic top-off\" is part of nouns.wtf; other governance clients can choose whether they implement this behavior*)\n\n### Example:\n* Builder A creates a proposal that requests 100,000 USDC\n* 2 actions will be added to the proposal:\n    1. Send 100K USDC from the TokenBuyer to Builder A\n    2. Send $150K worth of ETH to TokenBuyer to swap for USDC\n       * The extra $50K (50% buffer) is added in case ETH price goes down\n       * If TokenBuyer already holds ETH, then it will be sent less ETH accordingly\n* When the proposal executes:\n    1. 100K USDC it sent to Builder A\n        * If TokenBuyer has less than 100K USDC on hand, a debt will be registered towards Builder A\n    3. TokenBuyer will swap ETH for 100K USDC\n    4. Any remaining USDC debt to Builder A is paid as soon as it is swapped\n\n### UI preview\n\nThis is a preview of a new proposal creation flow for nouns.wtf developed by Brian.\nIt will go live once it's possible to request USDC.\n\n![proposal_ui_1](https://i.imgur.com/cOqFO3V.png)\n![proposal_ui_2](https://i.imgur.com/vZNqCJ7.png)\n\n### Parameters\n\n* `baselinePaymentTokenAmount`: amount of USDC to hold \"on hand\". Currently set to $500,000.\n* `botDiscountBPs`: a price discount to incentivize anyone (probably bots) to swap USDC for ETH. Currently set to 10 bps (0.1%).\n\n### Admin access\n* The tech pod & the DAO have an \"operator\" privilege with permissions to:\n    * Modify `baselinePaymentTokenAmount`, allowed range is: 0 - $1M\n    * Modify `botDiscountBPs`, allowed range is: 0-150 (0-1.5%)\n    * Pause TokenBuyer swaps\n    * Withdraw ETH from TokenBuyer and send it to the DAO\n    * Change the operator\n* Only the DAO has the ability to:\n    * Send USDC\n    * Change the allowed ranges for `baselinePaymentTokenAmount` and `botDiscountBPs`\n\n### Arbitrage bot\n* A reference bot has been developed and [open-sourced](https://github.com/solimander/eth-buyer-arbitrage-bot) by solimander. We encourage anyone to run their own bot or improve on the code\n* The tech pod will be running the reference bot at the beginning to bootstrap the system\n* Anyone can perform swaps against TokenBuyer. If we see low activity, we will increase the `botDiscountBPs` parameters to increase the incentive (e.g. if gas prices become high).\n\n## Auditing and Testing\n\n* The smart contracts were audited by yAcademy. [Audit report](https://github.com/nounsDAO/token-buyer/blob/166ec30ecd5dada8e17b55317ce3823d4c36b35f/audit/yAcademy_NounsDAO_TokenBuyer_review.pdf)\n    * No \"critical\" issues were found\n    * 1 \"high\" and 1 \"medium\" issues were found. The \"high\" issue was fixed, and the \"medium\" issue was acknowledged as not being an issue for us.\n* Prior to this proposal a few rounds of funding and spending using Token Buyer were done on mainnet\n\n\n## Funding\n* Assuming `baselinePaymentTokenAmount` is set to $500K, we would want to fund TokenBuyer with enough ETH to swap for $500K.

Sailing is one of the most prestigious sports and often gets attention of the media, guests, and residents. It's enjoyable to participate in, to watch live, and creates beautiful images and video to share.\n\n\n### Nouns in the New York Harbor\nNFT.NYC is only four months away. Most likely NFT and web3 projects are going to run the same promotions with posters and billboards. *Why not make something different?*\n\nFollowing the success of [Prop 102](https://nouns.wtf/vote/102), I would like to organize a sailing event on April 9th in New York with help of Manhattan Yacht Club. The NFT.NYC sailing event is going to be order of magnitute larger to match the gravity of the legendary New York.\n\n\nI will put together a fleet of seven J/24 sailboats and one bigger sailboat in New York bay with Nounish sails. We are going to invite Nounish people and sail together from New Jersey to Manhattan, Brooklyn Bridge, and the Statue of Liberty.\n\nWe'll be using J/24 sailboats for this event because it is the world's most popular one-design keelboat. It is a classic Porsche of sailing and respected by all sailors. It is easy to sail and looks beautiful when you get up the Nounish spinnakers.\n\n\n### Interactive Community Building\nThe plan is to make teams of 3 experienced sailors and 3-4 guests for each boat. The guests will be able to actively participate by steering boats and trimming sails. We are going to use one bigger boat to accomodate all guests and swap guests on boats near the Statue Of Liberty so all the guests can get full experience. 100 people will be invited, with priority to for the Nouns community. 20 invitations will be sent to special NFT.NYC attendees (media, artists, etc.) \n\nIt is going to be unforgettable experience. Later, we can gather together at Manhattan Yacht Club's clubhouse and share a few beers.\n\nLet's enjoy early spring sailing in NYC together and use this unique opportunity as a team building and proliferating event. A lot of New Yorkers and visitors are going to see Nouns logos during NFT.NYC and posted on social networks.\n\n### Documentation\nAll events/locations before and during the event will be documented and all media will be regularly shared with the [nounish ⌐◨-◨](https://twitter.com/nounish) team and posted on social networks.\n\n----\n# Details\n\n### Event map\n![](https://i.imgur.com/ysZx8iI.png)\n\n### Nouns branded sail designs\n![](https://i.imgur.com/S7SfqsE.jpg)\n\nBased on sail inventory availabe at Manhattan Yacht Club, it would be best to buy both mainsail and spinnaker sails. The available at manhattan yacht club sails have mount gay rum logos and wouldn't look good during our photo ops.\n\nDiscussions on sail designs and upcomming events will be posted on twitter and nounish discord.\n\nAfter NFT.NYC, the sails will be shipped and stored in my yacht club, in korea for possible future Nounish events.\n\nThere are four different design options availbe\n1) same color fabric, red noggles\n2) same color fabric, different color noggles\n3) different color fabrick, red noggles\n4) different color fabric, different color noggles\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Jiz8Rn0.png)\n\nIMO most of the beautiful thing about nouns community is collective hacking, designing, and thinking. I would like to get feedback from community to find best sail designs. \n\n\n----\n# Budget\n### Nouns NFT.NYC sailing photo op & team building\nWe going to invite as many people as possible, starting with Nounish folks. The event would be a best way to proliferate Nouns and organize a team building event for Nounish people.\n- **$24,000** Chartering fees for 7+ boats at Manhattan Yacht Club\n    - I received quote of $3,800 per boat for a general public\n    - The price might go down after I send an official request from my yacht club\n- **$35,000** Nouns sails inventory for 7+ boats\n    - (branded spinnakers and mainsails)\n    - I wil keep all the sails safe for future possible events. For example, NFT.NYC sailing event in 2024!\n- **$10,000** Small travel grants for sailing teams comming from Seattle, San Francisco, Texas, Michigan, Maryland.\n    - We need experienced crew to operate sailboats.\n    - The plan is to make teams of 3 pro sailors and 3-4 guests per one boat\n- **$15,000** Safety and media motor boats etc\n    - It is very important to have a couple motor boats available for media or in the case of emergency\n- **$5,000** The big boat is going to accomodate more guests. Later, on the way back from the Statue Of Liberty, we aregoing to swap guests and give more people chance to experience J/24 sailing.\n    - NFT.NYC is a big event and we might want to invite a lot of interesting people to the Nouns sailing event\n    - Also, some parts of New York bay is no fly zone for drones so it would be best to put a few photographers on a bigger boat\n- **$15,000** photo/video team\n- **$5,000** Nouns branded t-shirts and caps to look like a true team (120 pcs)\n- **$5,000** BBQ, beers, and rum for after party at Manhattan Yacht Club\n- **$21,000** expenses for operations team including me; $7k per person (I will need at least two reliable people with sailing experience with me to organize 7+ sailboats, photo ops, coordinate everyone etc; getting ready venue and boats 2 days before the event; 2 days cleaning boats and packing everything after the event)\n- **$15,000** budget for unexpected expenses and price offset (we can use some money to make invitations, rent more sailboats, buy more sails, stickers for boats, add more safety measures, shipping or storage for sails after the event etc)\n- **$10,000** I would like to request a small compensation for my efforts to plan the event for next 3 months.\n\n**Total: $160,000 or ~134 ETH (1 ETH = $1,200)**\n\nWe are asking for $160,000. It is a lot of money but it is worth every dollar if you look at everything we are going to accomplish.\n\n----\n# Person in Charge\nI am [fiveoceans_dev](https://twitter.com/fiveoceans_dev), member of Nouncil, creator of [Prop 102](https://nouns.wtf/vote/102), sailing since 2011, and love Nouns Community.\n\n---- \n# Multisig\nThe receiving address is a Gnosis Safe with 4/6 signers.\n\n**Multisig address**: 0xAC2671bAaA44b79cA1Fb006750c684E5349d721b\n\n**Multisig signers:**\n1. **toady_hawk**: 0x5D802e2Fe48392c104Ce0401C7ECa8a4456f1F16\n2. **benbodhi**: 0x80826180A2629206E3499B5167aaC8440E3F87f6\n3. **adrianmcli**: 0xE7304bA0f157f2Ade94015934284b6704BC72911\n4. **Brennen**: 0xf8a065f287d91d77cd626af38ffa220d9b552a2b\n5. **142**: 0xE6232ed3436C4065D38D8BFdC8EA90858ecDfa69\n6. **fiveoceans_dev**: 0xDf6e59c6DF1E9500fd35A76FF4C62F9901E90019\n\n$160,000 USD = ~134 ETH (1 ETH = $1,200 USD)\nAdding 15% buffer for volatility: 154 ETH\n\n**Proposed Transaction**\n```\n0xAC2671bAaA44b79cA1Fb006750c684E5349d721b.transfer(\n 154.0 ETH\n)\n```\n\n### Swap Plan\nUpon receipt of funds, signers will convert the ETH to $160,000 USDC.\n- Leftover ETH will be sent back to Nouns DAO treasury\n- $60,000 USDC will be sent to fiveoceans_dev's wallet upon conversion\n    - the money will be used to book sailboats, and pre-order sails \n- $100,000 USDC will be kept in the safe until all the details of the Nouns NFT.NYC sailing event are finalized and posted (date, event program, sail designs, invitations)\n\n","proposer":"0xc2d4f2D86E9fF3415C7e0C3Ee44C8819D25Fe413","startBlock":16005898,"endBlock":16041898,"executed":true},"votes":[{"support":1,"voter":"0xf8A065F287d91d77cD626AF38ffA220D9B552A2b","numberOfVotes":3,"reason":"SAIL!"},{"support":1,"voter":"0xa903C06BF35286f6d1cDAD25396748353979a44C","numberOfVotes":2,"reason":"These boats look amazing on the water and what better place than New York?

Conveying a good idea in a way that voters can understand and relate to is even more difficult.  With the increased number of proposals and ideas coming in weekly, it’s more important than ever to effectively communicate one's idea and value proposition.  For some builders, proposal writing may not be a core strength. So their proposals may fail on-chain, even if the core concept is valuable.\n    \n2. **Effective Communication with DAO Voters is Difficult**\n    \n    One of the most difficult challenges for builders in the Nouns ecosystem has always been figuring out how to have open dialog with voting Nouners and Delegates. These challenges will only increase as the DAO grows. Now, with the Official Nouns Discord closed, this is an even more pressing issue. \n    \n3. **Constructive and Honest Feedback is Rare**\n    \n    Very few people within Nouns are giving truly honest and constructive criticism to proposals that need work. Discourse and Nouncil feedback sometimes can be “soft”, as people may not want to publicly discuss the potential pitfalls of a fellow community member’s idea or hurt their feelings.  We see this occurring more frequently with on-chain proposals, and it doesn’t help anyone in the long run.\n\n\n\n[![boxbrain.gif](https://i.postimg.cc/14xN6w0Y/boxbrain.gif)](https://postimg.cc/wRVvYtGh)*Think INSIDE the box!*\n\n\n# Our Solutions\n\n**PropBox will aim to solve the above pain points in the following ways:**\n\n1. Ugly Dao has a talented roster of builders, many of whom have experience writing successful proposals for Prop House, NSFW and on-chain. We also have professionals with experience in the legal, marketing, education, and communications fields. With our combined training and experience, we can help builders create proposals that make an impact. Additionally, sometimes the most difficult part of seeking funding from Nouns is **knowing where to go.** We can help proposers understand if their idea is best suited to a Prop House round, an NSFW pitch, a discussion with the newly minted DCS Pod, or a full on-chain proposal. Finally, we believe that proposals should lean on multimedia content to achieve maximum impact in an attention-scarce environment. We want to help builders integrate engaging videos and visuals into their proposals.\n\n2. We know the Nouns community like the back of our Ugly hand, and can help new builders navigate the difficult task of amplifying the message of their proposal. From appearances on The Noun Square, discussions in Nouncil or other Nounish discords, as well as conversations on Twitter, Discourse, House of Nouns and elsewhere, we know how to help builders with the most difficult part of getting funded for a proposal: **Communicating directly with the people who ultimately will vote yes or no.** \n\n3. The DAO needs more well-intentioned people who are not afraid to give would-be builders The Ugly Truth, and we are prepared to do so.\n\n\n# The PropBox Value Prop\n\nOur goal is to become the premier resource to help builders create great proposals and find pathways to funding in the Nouns ecosystem. We plan to find and incubate teams and projects from multiple sources, including:\n\n- Current builders in the ecosystem who are looking for feedback and help navigating the proposal process.\n- New builders who need extra help onboarding into Nouns, writing proposals, and making the right connections to be successful.\n- “Uncut gems” from Prop House and Discourse to fund proof of concept projects and prepare the teams for potential larger on-chain proposals in the future. We aim to find builders with the highest potential and help them fulfill that potential. Ideas from this category should have at least 10x potential from the amount of initial funding.\n\n# The Origin Story\n\nThis project began as an initiative by [Andrew ](https://nounsagora.com/delegate/andrewladdusaw.eth)[Laddusaw](https://twitter.com/AndrewLaddusaw), through [Nouncil](https://discord.gg/nouncil), following the [Combinator Round in Prop House](https://prop.house/nouns/open-round:-25-eth) back in July (aka “the before times.”) Andrew saw a lot of talented teams that submitted great proposals, but of course the round only had one winner for the 25ETH prize. \n\nHe began contacting builders and building a system within Nouncil Discord to give these teams feedback to prepare them for an on-chain proposal, or to help them secure alternative funding sources. When they began reviewing proposals publicly as a group, other builders asked for help as well.\n\nDuring this initial trial, the Incubator team gave feedback to 9 proposals. Through that process: One secured funding through NSFW. One pursued another Prop House to fund a proof of concept, won, and later joined Nouncil. One ended up abandoning the initial idea, but moved on to other projects during the incubation process, and has now been funded for multiple other projects within the DAO (shout out [ripe0x](https://nounsagora.com/delegate/ripe0x.eth).) Two other proposals ended up with on-chain votes, one narrowly being defeated and one securing funding for 40 ETH (Prop 144 for One Click Bots). \n\n[![andre-testimonial.gif](https://i.postimg.cc/JnndSt6P/andre-testimonial.gif)](https://vimeo.com/774010662/b852cb4533)\n*Click to watch a 2 minute PropBox testimonial video from Andrei (BotFrens)*\n\nWe learned a lot through this experiment. We’re continuing to follow up with the builders as they hone their ideas, and expect to see even more fruit from these efforts in the coming months. We’re also continuing to improve our feedback process and we believe we’re ready for the next phase of growth.\n\n\n# The Timeline\n\n**This proposal will support the PropBox team for a 3 month period to do the following:**\n\n- Actively locate builders in the ecosystem to help drive their ideas forward and guide them through the proposal process that is most appropriate to their ideas and building stage.\n- Create an active Builder’s Guild in the PropBox Discord, where those who are creating tools and proposals can do so in the open, and together. This well help create consistent startup energy in the Nouns community.\n- Review every Discourse, and various Discord community posts, making sure everyone submitting proposal ideas gets quality feedback and the best possible Nouns experience when they first arrive in the community. One of our greatest desires is that new, talented builders would not leave the community discouraged after getting negative feedback, simply because they didn’t understand the funding process or the culture of what it means to be a part of Nouns.\n- Create a website to house a toolkit of templates, best practices, tips and tricks, and contact information giving builders a toolbox to maximize success.\n- We will also spend the next three months exploring several ideas, which we will present to the community at the end of the proposal funding period:\n    - *How to potentially make an incubator like this self-sustaining in the future.*\n    - *A system to temperature check proposals and gather feedback from as many sources as possible, including from those with the most likelihood to swing vote outcomes.*\n    - *How to create efficiencies in the proposal process, so that new community members can transition from their first interactions to building as effectively as possible within the DAO.*\n    - *Exploring systems of trust-building to make sure that scammers are not able to abuse the treasury through gaming or fraud.*\n    - *Decisions about what form this group should take in the future; how to incorporate new members, ideas, and processes to maintain the highest degree of quality feedback, help, and value to the DAO.*\n\n\nAll of the above is to serve the ultimate goals of PropBox: \n\n**To help builders write high quality proposals, and to make decision-making simpler and less time-consuming for DAO members.**\n\n# The Budget\n\n**75ETH** **Total**\n\n- **60 ETH** - In our trial, we were able to achieve a great deal of success with people who were just volunteering their time. We know that with DAO funding, we will have much more capacity to onboard talented builders and incubate many more proposals. \n    - **20 ETH** per month as a payment to team members, to be paid retroactively based on work completed and builders helped. This work will include engaging builders at every stage of the proposal process, guiding them, and helping to write effective and media-rich proposals. These team rewards will be distributed via biweekly Coordinape rounds (Nouncil model.) All payment data will be publicly available to the DAO. \n    - Our team goal will be to engage with a minimum of 30 builders about their proposals over the course of a 3 month period. \n    \n- **10 ETH** for a pool to fund some small projects, as an experiment in additional targeted flexible funding for the DAO: Taking small ideas that we encounter through the process of our work and helping those teams to execute small ideas or create MVPs of larger ones. \n- **5 ETH** of retro funding for what has been done to build this system already.\n\n# The PropBox Team\n\nWe are a group of Nounish builders that have created and executed successful proposals at every funding level. We are consistently active in Discourse, offering constructive feedback and working privately with builders to help them formulate effective proposals and seek funding. We are passionate about great ideas, effective communication, and robust proposals that drive the nounish meme forward. ⌐◨-◨\n\n[![propbox-group-shot-smaller.png](https://i.postimg.cc/qvQ8CwwZ/propbox-group-shot-smaller.png)](https://postimg.cc/ZWB9Gr1r)\n\n- ***Lead: [Andrew Laddusaw](https://nounsagora.com/delegate/andrewladdusaw.eth)***\n- ***Core Team:***\n***[BradQ](https://twitter.com/iambradq)***\n***[ProfWerder](https://nounsagora.com/delegate/profwerder.%E2%8C%90%E2%97%A8-%E2%97%A8)***\n***[SuperTightWoody](https://nounsagora.com/delegate/supertight.eth)***\n***[Toady Hawk](https://nounsagora.com/delegate/toadyhawk.%E2%8C%90%E2%97%A8-%E2%97%A8)***\n\n***Support: Other UglyDAO Members***\n*18 super builders and counting with diverse skills and talents who are passionate ambassadors for Nouns inside and outside of the community*\n\n**Multisig:**\n*Funds will be transferred to and held in a 3/5 Gnosis Safe (propboxvault.eth) with the 5 trusted Nouns community members above.*\n\n# The Bottom Line\n\nWe believe the DAO needs to attract more awesome builders, and needs teams of diligent people finding good ideas and helping them to bloom into full-fledged, effective Nounish initatives. \n\nWe are uniquely qualified to help these builders write awesome proposals, strategize ideal funding paths, and facilitate DAO communications, and we are asking for a mandate to do exactly that. \n\n## Think INSIDE the Box, vote YES for Prop 175!

To that end, the market has the ability to signal whether the PropBox idea/team/approach works and funding to the extent requested would distort this process.\nIn addition to reducing the timeline and funding amount, I would recommend voting for this proposal if it had target metrics: 1 month, interface with 10-15 builders, target 1-2 amazing on-chain proposal, include a “finders fee” to subsidize the funding gap.\n\ndevcarrot:\nI agree with the other Nounders that there should be a market for this type of advising that takes the form of a \"finders fee\" or \"tip\".

Periodically, I've seen a tonne of contests hosted by our nounish communities such as [coloring book contests](https://nounsarchive.wtf/portfolio/nounsense-02) by Noun22 & Messhup, [memes contests](https://nounsarchive.wtf/portfolio/noadz-valentines-day) by Noadz, and is now mainly being held by the [Noun Square](https://twitter.com/thenounsquare) team. We have seen full of delightful contest submissions with all sorts of genres from all across the world.\n\nI took an initiative to build a website where we can display all of the entries from NounsDAO's contestants because I personally feel it is very important for the DAO to do so. Additionally, it provides access to all future possibilities. \n\nAs time passes, I feel it needs to grow even more by including all of the Nouns projects from the community and not only the contestants. Our memes proliferations are all contained inside.\n\nWhy is it important to document and archive these things?\n\n> \"The body continuously explores time and space. It holds our history, if we listen closely.\" -Chloe Chotrani\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/aDIU2rB.jpg)\n\n---\n\n### **Summary**\n\n* **Long-term Vision** ; \n    * To retain past and future historical key data of all talented builders & artists that contribute around Nouns ecosystem.\n\n* **Objective** ; \n    * 1) To help **onboard newcomers** that are interested in Nouns so they can catch a **glimpse** of what the project is all about. Navigation will be improved through enhanced visual design to create a stronger first impression.\n    * 2) **References that act as inspiration**. Drawing from references is beneficial because it provides our imaginations with tangible things to model after.\n    * 3) To create potential opportunity for artists / builders to receive **commissions or collaborative works/projects** with others.\n\n* **Strategy** ; \n    * 1) **Simplified TL;DR / streamlined landing page with upgraded visuals** consists of ; *to browse relevant areas & specific parameters* ;\n            * simplified projects/contests brief\n            * project owner/hosts\n            * total funded/prizes\n            * categories (*ex; art, community, tech, marketing, physical etc*)\n            * links to discourse/full props/related infos/contests\n            * social media (*ex; twitter, discord*)\n            * tags / filters *(most recent, oldest, alphabetically)*\n            * distinct project images with descriptions\n            * status\n            * contest winners\n            * CC0 label together with proof of CC0 (*ex; toggle/submit forms etc*)\n            * search bar with data points\n            *( all are shown under **Details**)*\n\n    * 2) **Coordinate with other existing platforms** already in place (ex. ***[nouns.center](https://nouns.center/), [proposal.wtf](https://maty-eth.notion.site/maty-eth/NounsDAO-Proposals-Overview-b8c76e6ac8e44515966ee032ea20f860), [nounish](https://twitter.com/nounish)***) by pooling resources & efforts for maximum efficiency and also to complement each other.\n    * 3) **Contents sustainability** ; we will be using Notion for the database and will be publically viewable. Content submission form with formats will be available for community use. An additional idea is to work with Nouns AI team for data scraping by using certain hashtags/keywords *(to be discuss)*.\n    * 4) **CC0 Contents & Icon** ; any artist can **enable or declare** their work to be CC0 by submitting forms that will be made available soon. It is freely usable by anyone for remixing and other creative purposes. A \"CC0\" icon will appear that contains additional proof of CC0.\n    * 5) A **daily dose of nounish things** ; daily curated posting of one random nounish project to give more **visibility & brand consistency** for long term goals.\n    * 6) Main whiteboard to organise works ; [Nouns Archive's FigJam](https://www.figma.com/file/g1etPE6nK6WtwK35i9C8gs/Nouns-Archive?node-id=0%3A1).\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/YtMFFYJ.jpg)\n\n* **Measuring Success** ; \n    * 1) We are tracking using Google Analytics and will factor in a monthly report & insights of the website.\n    * 2) As per *image* attached, it is an event count for 2 months. \n    * 3) Organic views and engagements will always be the baseline metrics, but currently, **85%** of the contents are exclusively focus on contest entries.

Recent events have highlighted the dire need and importance of such work. This prop proposes to fund 100 ETH to their donation address: zachxbt.eth (address can be verified from their twitter profile).\n\nDonations have always been somewhat controversial within Nouns governance. [Prop 21](https://nouns.wtf/vote/21) donating 169 ETH to Gitcoin grants was one of the most contentious votes in our early history. [Prop 108](https://nouns.wtf/vote/108) donating 500 ETH to Ethereum protocol development (via the Protocol Guild) was much more unanimous but still there was discomfort and discourse around whether the DAO was becoming \"a tax inefficient way for DAO members to make donations.\" \n\nI agree that we shouldn't resort to becoming a complacent vehicle of passive philanthropy. We should instead aim to actively contribute and be a net producer of public goods ourselves such that our meme (brand) can fully capture the provenance value (claim on originality of) the public work and thus leverage the virtuous cycle to do more than what capital alone could have done. However, there should be exceptions to this rule if there is an urgent and common public cause that warrants highlighting. I would like to suggest that this is such a case. Crypto needs more validators like ZachXBT.\n\nWith donations we need to be extra wary of conflicts of interest or self-dealing. Unfortunately there is no way to prove this cryptographically, but I attest that I have no prior (or planned future) relationship with ZachXBT and that today was the first time I contacted them (via twitter) to ask for their permission to make this proposal.

Our initial proposal had no funding for the team, but we were recommended otherwise by Nouners.\n\n**Public Application:**\n* Explorer Grants will be publicized via Twitter, 1:1 outreach from the team and its network, Twitter Spaces with Nouns community organizations, Discords, etc\n* Candidates will submit public applications, showing past work and motivations for exploring the Nouns ecosystem, as well as a couple problem spaces that interest them\n  * These applications will also benefit the community at large who can recruit builders from this group\n* Candidates will largely be assessed on talent, potential, and excitement about Nouns. Reasoning for accepted candidates will be made public. The 3-person team will decide on 4 final candidates to accept.\n* 1 slot in the program will be allocated to a Nouns community vote\n\n**Program:**\n* 10 ETH for 2 months of part-time exploration for each builder\n  * *Detail: Overpaying slightly is critical to attracting talent that may not otherwise come to us. We are targeting people who make more than $150,000 a year in their full-time job*\n* Weekly check-in call with builders. Members of the Explorer Grants team will help them explore ideas, connect them to Nouners and builders, and lead workshops\n* **End of Program Objective:** each builder submits an on-chain or Prop House prop for continued funding\n\n### Team\n* **mrtn, lead organizer:**\n    * Previously a PM at Google and NBA Top Shot, he has now contributed to a variety of Nounish projects - Nouns Builder, AI Pod, Agora, as well as doing a 24 Hour Nounish live stream, and receiving a Governance Historian grant. At USC, he ran an organization that guided students towards entrepreneurship, whose members include several YC startups. He's a big believer in diversifying funding sources for Nouns builders, and experimenting with the patronage model. *Comp: 3 ETH / month*\n* **jihad, community & product expert:**\n    * Core contributor at Forefront, creating media and building infrastructure for tokenized communities. He is also a delegate and “Lil Nouncilor” at Lil Nouns DAO, a contributor to Public Nouns, one of the winners of the recent Nouns Agora delegate race, and is part of the team building [Adjectives](nouns.terminal.co), an analytics and proposal evaluation platform for Nouns DAO. Jihad believes that Nouns must be a center of excellence for tokenized communities, and the Explorer Grants program would be a step in the right direction in attracting the brightest minds to do focused yet unstructured work in the Nouns ecosystem. *Comp 2 ETH / month*\n* **dot, technical expert:**\n    * Dot is an iOS dev turned nounish builder - a founding member of Nouncil and most recently Lil Nounder at Lil Nouns DAO; the first full fork of Nouns DAO. Dot started Lil Nouns as a way to expose nouns to as many people as possible. Lil Nouns DAO leverages its 8 nouns alongside its own treasury to fund and support public goods built by lil nouners. In doing so, Lil Nouns has become a builder onramp to Nouns DAO itself. *Comp: 2 ETH / month*\n\n***We will use a 3 of 5 multi-sig, with the core team members as well as krel and yitong.***\n\n### Questions\n**How will you actually find these builders?** Our team has fairly deep networks within the crypto and broader tech space; we'll leverage our personal connections as well as our social media presence to find more builders. Additionally, a large appeal of programs like these (Thiel Fellowship, Prop House, MacArthur Grants) is the benefit of continued funding + prestige, which we intend to lean into.\n\n**But what if the builders don't do anything?** This is similar to everything in Nouns already - there's a social contract to uphold, someone could always dissapear after receiving 200 ETH on-chain. We can setup the grant via Sablier to revoke if a builder goes MIA, however.\n\n**What will they actually build?** The first round will not have a particular mandate but future ones could be structured closer to Prop House mandated rounds, where there is a theme. We believe that time and freedom is key to allowing talented builders to find something meaningful to build long-term.\n\n**Why not just run this on Prop House?** Decisions are not always best made by large committees. Prop House rounds do not allow for deep conversation and analysis of candidates. A transparent, small committee allows for depth and betting on candidates who might not otherwise get a shot (i.e. people who aren't good at writing a description on prop house but would be amazing builders). Additionally, we'd like to create a long-term relationship with these builders via an organized cohort.\n\n**What if no good work comes out of this?** That's a possibility, as is the case with prop house rounds. However, we believe that Nouns already has a great enough brand to attract solid builders. However, if nothing goods comes out of this trial, then we will have learned that pro-active grants for attracting builders is not a valid technique for our DAO. If there are takeaways, they can be adapted into other funding sources, like Prop House or NSFW in the future.\n\n**Why are you being paid?** Our initial proposal did not include payment for the team, but it was suggested by Nouners that we should be getting paid to create accountability, as well as allow us to dedicate more time in making this more of a full-fledged program than one-off grants with no support from us.\n\n### Total Funding\n5 Builders x 10 ETH = 50 ETH\nTeam Comp: 14 ETH\nTotal: 64 ETH\n\n***Questions?

It’s like Adult Swim on a dozen espresso shots, in one-minute-or-less episodes, released as 1/1 NFTs.\n\nThis is an opportunity to expand Nouns DAO culture by unleashing highly visible artist-created, community-developed CC0 video content that can be distributed everywhere. It’s also a brand-new way to use web3 tooling to release episodic videos, and an opportunity to pioneer a decentralized media production model that can help inform the future of entertainment. \n**takes a breath*\n\nRead on and watch the below video to learn more.\n\n[![Worst Case Decision](https://cdn.hashku.com/wcd/Nouns_WCD_Pitch_vid_screenshot_1500x.jpg)\n](https://vimeo.com/772223496/a53f2e2dad \"Worst Case Decision\")\n\n\n## What’s Worst Case Decision?\nWorst Case Decision is maybe the first episodic “show” to be released as an NFT series.\n\nEach season of WCD features 7 bite-sized fever dreams that are handcrafted into 30-70 second “episodes.” Every episode chases surreal characters along a bat-shit hyper-casual narrative that loosely follows a theme. So far we’ve explored themes such as “mayonnaise portal,” “everyone is wet,” “hi-fi asparagus rain,” and “too many cats,” to name a few.\n\nThe show’s vibe feels like surfing in a sea of technicolor absurdity, with a low-fi, internet-infused, stop-motion animation style. Video, painting, web3, DALL-E, comedy, commerce… WCD has it all. (Scroll to the bottom of this proposal to view sample episodes.)\n\n**Worst Case Decision Quick Facts:**\n\n* 50 Seasons planned, 7 episodes per season (350 episodes total)\n* Episodes released episodically as 1/1 video NFTs via worstcasedecision.com\n* Each season features an ever-changing cast of characters and collaborators\n* NFTs can be purchased with credit card and digital currency (ETH)\n\n## What makes this exciting for Nouns DAO?\nWe’re at the dawn of a new era for entertainment—one that will enable audiences and creators to build sustainable models of cultural production together. As perhaps the first-ever serialized 1/1 NFT video collection, Worst Case Decision is taking a pioneering approach to launching meme-y, weird, funny narrative shorts with and for the communities who believe this kind of art should exist in the world. \n\nBeyond pioneering this new web3-native episodic production model, there are a few specific benefits that Nouners can expect from supporting this project:\n\n**Noun-ified Episodes**\nThe entire season will be built based on decentralized creative direction by opening up key decisions to the Nouners (and in some cases the internet at large, for max visibility). This includes community input/voting on:\n* The “themes” of each episode\n* Protagonists (I’ve got so many weird character ideas, man)\n* Supporting cast (really, so many weird characters)\n* Episode backgrounds\n\n**CC0 Content & Nouns Memes**\nThe Nouns season of WCD will be entirely CC0. This means that anyone can meme the shit out of the entire season, which will be full of Nouns references, noggles, and other inside jokes specific to Nouns’ community, culture, and lore. Cut up and re-mix the episodes however y’all see fit, and post wherever you want.\n\n**Additional Benefits to Nouns DAO**\n\n1)\t**Major marketing and PR exposure.** This is a first-of-its-kind video collection in the NFT space, and there’s “a lot of press to be had.”\n2)\t**WCD is planned for 50 seasons.** Nouns would be the 3rd season of 50, and the first-ever sponsored season—representing an early entry into supporting what could become a historic release.\n3)\t**Introduce Marc’s audience to Nouns.** I’ve been an independent artist for 25 years, and as a result I’m decently well known. I can help bring the fine art world’s attention to Nouns and web3 at large.\n4)\t**Reach non-web3-savvy folks, too.** Our tech partner [Hashku](https://hashku.com) has both crypto-native and custodial credit card minting solutions, meaning that non-crypto folks can participate in NFT auctions.\n\n![](https://cdn.hashku.com/wcd/nouns_pfp_collage%20copy_sm.jpg)\n\nThese are just mere examples of potential Nouns x WCD characters! Glorious, yes? Please feel free to take ‘em and make ‘em [your PFPs](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Ff52SL1p3PGzdxYtCO7kyA9kpE2N4EAY?usp=share_link). (Shhhh…. there will be plenty more via https://nouns.build/ in the future.) \n\n## What makes this exciting for Collectors?\nI care immensely about my collectors. I want to add value and make the experience as fun and engaging as the episodes themselves. We have an expansive vision and are thrilled to include our collectors along this journey. \n\nIf you are a holder of a WCD episode from any season, you’ll get access to:\n\n* My network via a private discord channel for collectors (a seat on the board so to speak)\n* Input on IRL WCD events\n* Early access to future WCD collabs and projects  \n\n## Marketing & Community Development\nOur philosophy for marketing and PR follows the vision for the project. Simply put: Our weird creative vision and IRL performances are going to cause some really interesting responses, which we’ll engage with using our built-in strengths with social media and PR.\n\n**Marketing Plan**\n\n* **Launch activities** – Our team will produce strategic content and a mix of online and IRL activations to generate as much pre-launch awareness as possible. We have an existing list of interested & interesting media partners to engage here. The web3 PR agency Serotonin is among them.\n*  **High-velocity engagement** – A dedicated Project Ambassador will act as a marketing strategist, online social maestro, and Nouns champion, using multi-channel engagement tactics to build momentum. \n\n* **Partnerships & sponsorships** – I (Marc) have a long history of partnering with brands to co-create projects. We will be bringing on some truly exciting collaborators and sponsors to spread the word even farther.\n\n* **Long-term community growth** – Our desire is to make this project fully self-sustaining. To do this, our goal is to increase the performance of NFT auctions and overall engagement with the series by aggressively growing the WCD community. \n\n* **Transparent success metrics** – We will track and analyze meaningful engagement metrics to keep the community informed on how we’re doing, and to strengthen our marketing approaches overall.\n\n## Open-Sourcing Our Promo Strategy\n\nWe wish to be as transparent as possible with our learnings about marketing and running this project. We’ll create a public document outlining our goals, metrics, successes, and learnings so that our efforts can help future projects and the community at large.\n\n## Project Team\n\nIn addition to an amazing lineup of advisors, our core team currently consists of the following:\n\n**Marc Horowitz** // Creator & Visionary \n**Chris Coy** // Partner & Spiritual Advisor \n**Damien Newman** // Creative Consultant & Power Supporter \n**Matt Casanova** // Builder of Technologies\n**Hashku** // Minting Platform\n\n## Budget\nAnticipated activities and budgets (by phases):\n\n* **Pre-Production** – $9,650\nStudio usage, lighting equipment, episode concepting/ production planning for all 7 episodes, props, backgrounds, art department (hand making all the noggles and weird other props).\n\n* **Production** – $16,875 \nDirector fee, cinematographer/camera operator fee, additional creative direction and shoot crew/collaborators, daily incidentals during shoot (food, grip, etc), and production assistance.\n\n* **Post-Production** – $11,500 \nSound finishing/sfx/sound design, music licensing, editing, smart contract customizations for specific season NFTs, season-specific website costs (video bandwidth and hosting). \n\n* **Promotion of Nouns + WCD Season (Outreach/Marketing/PR)** – $17,475\nSpread the word about the Nouns DAO and its sponsored season of WCD via strategic editorial write ups, podcast appearances, live events, IRL media stunts/performances, and other activations TBD.  See further notes in “Marketing Plan” (above).\n\n\n**Total Budget** ($55,500) + price contingency: **50 ETH** (converted to USDC immediately) \n\n\n## Timeline & Logistics\n\n**Mid-late February, 2023:** Launch the project with unsponsored seasons 1 and 2.\n\n**Mid-January:** Collaborate with the Nouns community. Using voting mechanisms and other means of gathering community input, we will collectively shape WCD season 3.\n\n**Mid-late January:** Once our Nouns season is planned, each episode takes roughly 2 days to film and edit. That brings pre-production, production, and post-production to 3-4 weeks total.\n\n## How NFT Auctions Will Work on worstcasedecision.com\nEach season of WCD video episodes will be dropped over the course of a week (dates will be announced via [@marchorowitz](https://twitter.com/marchorowitz)).\n* Each day at 9am PST a new episode will drop on worstcasedecision.com\n* Each episode will be released as a 1/1 NFT \n* Each NFT’s auction will end at 8:55:59 am PST the following day\n* When one auction closes, the next one drops—and this continues for 7 days in a row, Mon–Sun.\n\n## The Future of WCD and Episodic NFTs\nWe have the team and vision required to evolve WCD into a genre-defining series. Beyond this, we think we’re onto something in regards to how serialized NFTs can be used as a sustainable model to fund the production of some truly weird and great videos—and other creations as well.\n\nIf you are interested in learning more and chatting with Marc and the team personally, please reach out and we’ll have a chat ;)\n\n## Thank you, Nouners!\nIf I get the chance to collaborate with you all, I know we can make something really fun and amazing.

We will hand pick, and noun pill, five of our favorite creators to complete the other 5 shorts.\n\n**The Rules**\n1. The short must be funny.\n2. The short must be 15 seconds.\n3. The short must feature at least one Noun.\n\nProposers will submit a portfolio (or at least one example of previous work) + a 1 sentence creative pitch for their short.\n\n**Distribution**\n\nOnce the 10 shorts are complete we will plan for an entertaining online premiere, looking to collaborate with people in the Nouniverse, creators, and media outlets with established audiences. Then we will upload these to our own branded social media accounts and anywhere else on the internet that will showcase them. We will also provide the video files publically, allowing anyone to use them in future Nounish projects and news.\n\n**Awards**\n\nWe have an additional 20 ETH to award as prizes. We'll experiment with a variety of prizes and allocation methods including token gated Nounish community votes, live celebrity critic votes, and somehow we're going to get Goldy's dog to choose one prize winner. Also included will be a prize specifically for the best CC0 shorts to incentivize creators to release their content CC0.\n\nAll of our these additional prizes will be open to public submissions - artists not selected and funded through Prop House can create their short anyways and have another shot at competing for the prizes.\n\n**Branding**\n\n10 ETH is included to cover basic branding needed for this Prop House round. This could include logos, a simple website, a Nouns Shorts video bumper to play between shorts, etc. We will return any ETH we do not use to the treasury.\n\n\n---\n\n\n## Who is Nouns Stories\n**Stoopid Buddy**\n8 time Emmy-winning studio behind Robot Chicken & Nouns Documentary\n\n**Walter Newman**\nSVP at Adult Swim overseeing such shows as Rick & Morty, Robot Chicken, Smiling Friends, Lazor Wulf + Adult Swim shorts.\n\n**Pixel**\n[Goldy's](https://twitter.com/Goldypix) Oscar Shortlisted hybrid production studio are behind [nounish ⌐◨-◨](https://twitter.com/nounish) and the soon-to-be-released  animated short film \"[The Wizards Hat](https://twitter.com/nouns_stories/status/1570433066900017152?s=20&t=T_vYbAun_YQEsZUlEwfjSA)\" from the original Nouns Stories proposal. \n\n**Joshua Fisher**\nCreative manager, SharkDAO Rep, Ugly Noun, The Nouns Square Foundooor, NounsDAO Buildooor and Nouns narrative advocate.\n\n**Joel Cares**\nCEO of [Lobal Global](https://lobal.global/), video [Director](https://joelcares.net/), founding member of [Nouncil](http://nouncil.wtf/), creator of [Nerman](https://twitter.com/nermanbot).\n\n\n---\n\n## The Future\nSeason 1 is just the beginning.

Nouns X Everybody is more about the process itself (which could be applied to other areas, not just content creation). Additionally, although this proposal pays more to the winning submissions - it is doing so because it requires the team to produce AND distribute without a guarantee of payment. While the number of views are not everything, they do matter, as we can have the highest quality content in the world but it only matters if people see it. \n\nInstead of determining what we think people will want to see, this proposal will instead outline the guidelines in terms of output as well as the minimum result we want achieved in terms of outcome. Leaving it open for anyone to implement their own creative process in order to achieve that result.\n\nBy funding this the proposal we would hope to achieve the goals of:\n\n\n* Having a minimum of 10 pieces of original video content created, each with a minimum of 2k views on YouTube (20k total views minimum but I would expect much much more).\n* Getting new and innovative ideas from both from within and outside of our existing community by allowing them creative control on the output.\n* Bringing people into the Nouniverse as they will need to learn more about Nouns so as to create content which will enable them to win this challenge.\n* Showcase how the various elements of the DAO (see: ‘The Process’) can be combined to create a cohesive process for project implementation.\n* Demonstrating a proposal process that brings benefit to the DAO and rewards creators while not requiring compensation for the proposer. With 86% going to content creators, 12% going to marketing and just 1% going to administration along with 1% earmarked for an independent report on effectiveness of the proposal after 9 months. \n\n\n---\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n\n# THE BRIEF\n\n**Create a short hype video that either explains or pulls people into the Nouniverse and if your video gets over 2k views on YouTube before April 30th 2023 you could be awarded part of the $200k fund.**\n\nThe **Top 10 Videos** ranked by number of YouTube views that meet the minimum entry requirements below will be put up for a vote where **4 winners** will be selected and awarded **$50k each**.\n\n* Any person or team is free to submit an entry to this challenge. \n* To enter, simply create your video, upload it to YouTube and get people to watch it.\n\n___\n\n_**MINIMUM QUALIFYING CRITERIA**_ \n\n- Has more than 2000 organic views on Youtube by the end of the Submission Period\n- Must meet the brief (i.e. It either ‘explains the Nouns’ or ‘pulls people into the Nouniverse’)\n- Content must be original. While videos may reuse existing content if it is not mostly original it will not qualify.\n- Is positive in nature and is rated PG\n- Must be a video and not a YouTube \"shorts\"\n- Should include ‘#EnterTheNouniverse’ in the description (so we can easily filter submissions)\n\n\n---\n\nComplete creative freedom is given to entrants on how they want to achieve the goal – it can be animated, live footage, a mixture of both or something completely different. Some teams might focus on higher end productions that explains Nouns to people while others might focus on something simple and unique that pulls people into the Nouniverse (i.e. see the different approach[ Coinbase](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJ9pNQrz0fA&ab_channel=AnthonyKalamut) had vs other cypto companies during the superbowl in trying to achieve the same result). It is up to the creator to do what they think will work.\n\n\n\n---\n&nbsp;\n\n## SELECTION CRITERIA\n\nThe **Top 8 Videos with the most views on YouTube + 2 Videos chosen by the Selection Committee** will be entered into the Voting Round – where Noun holders will vote for the 4 winners of $50k each.\n\n\n\n* All videos must meet the minimum qualification criteria\n* Selected entries will be free to provide any additional information at this stage to be included in their entry which demonstrates why their content should win (for example, data from other social media platforms like Twitter, TikTok or any other measure of engagement)\n* Selected entries may be asked to provide information to the selection committee proving that their YouTube views were organic that the data has not been manipulated or paid for.\n* A person/team can submit as many entries as they want but only their best entry (which they can choose)  will be selected for the final vote.\n* We are including 2 videos selected by the committee due to the fact that some entries may not be in the Top 10 in terms of views of YouTube but may have merit for nomination through a disproportionate level of engagement on other channels and/or be of exceptional quality or have uploaded their video late in the process but has gained a lot of views in a short time period.\n---\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n\n# THE PROCESS\n\nIf this proposal is successful, the following process will take place:\n\n\n\n1. **Proposal Passes:** $200k and 25 Eth with be transferred to a multisig controlled by the Multisig. The challenge has officially started.\n2. **Submission Period:** There is a 5 Month window for anyone to create and publish their hype video.\n3. **Create Marketing Dept:** 25 Eth will immediately be used to fund a Prop House Round with 5 Eth being awarded to the 5 best proposals detailing how they will market and find entrants for this project. (see note at bottom)\n4. **Selection Period:** When the submission period has ended on April 30th 2023 there will be a 2 week selection period where the creators of the Top 10 videos will be invited by the Selection Committee to make their submissions. These submissions, including any additional information the creator wants to provide, will be uploaded to a Prop House round by the Selection Committee.The selection committee will be paid 3 eth for administering this.\n5. **Voting Round:** Nouns will have a 1 week voting period to cast their votes for the 4 winning submissions to be awarded $50k each.\n6. **Payment:** Funds will be distributed to the Winners by the Trusted Parties.\n7. **Analysis**: 2 eth will be earmarked for an indpedent evaluation of this proposal after 9 months. To see how effective it was at achieving the stated outcome. \n\n_**Important Note:** If no one meets the minimum qualifying criteria, the Nouns pay nothing (with the exception of the 25 eth used to fund the marketing dept prop house round) and all funds are returned to the Treasury. But for every person or team that does meet the criteria, we have at the very least a piece of original video content with more that 2k views on YouTube._ \n\n\n\n\n** **\n\n**Selection Committee:** The Selection committee will be comprised of 5 independent members of the Noun community, selected by Hindsight, whose job it will be: (a) select the Top 10 videos to be included in the final Noun vote as per the minimum qualifying criteria and the selection criteria above, (b) contact these creators to submit any additional information for the final vote and (c) upload those submissions to a Prop House vote.\n\nThe work of the selection committee is minimal and mostly administrative (checking that views are organic etc) and as such will only require 3 eth (of which I will get none).\n\n_In order to maintain independence and to ensure a fair process members of the selection committee cannot enter a video to the challenge_\n\n\n---\n\n**Stated Goals of this Proposal** \nIf this proposal passes, it success or failure will be measured against meeting the following criteria:\n* The creation of a minimum of 10 pieces of good quality, original content before April 30th\n* A minimum of 100k cumulative organic YouTube views across all content created in persuit of this prize before 9 months of this proposal passing\n___\n\n\n\n**Team** \nReally the point of this prop is that there is no 'team' but for the interest of transparency and to include a section I think should be in all props:\n* Hindsight: I am not a member of any other teams, councils or projects and I do not receive any compensation from any DAO source. I have no conflicts of interest and will not financially benefit from this proposal.\n* My only role will be to be on the multisig and to choose the selection commitee (A role I would be happy to give to someone else if they are suitable and want it!)\n\n\n---\n\n**Transaction Details**\n\n\n\n* 30 Eth will be transferred to fund a Prop House Round to create a marketing team for the challenge, the selection committee administration cost and the retrospective report on outcome.\n* $200k USD will be transferred to fund the prize pool.\n\n_If less than 4 teams do not meet the minimum qualifying criteria then any USDC that has not been used will be returned to the treasury._\n\n**Total Cost:** $200k + 30 Eth\n\n**Multisig**\n\nThe multisig is a 3/5 consisting of the 5 best looking members of the dao\n\n* [Hindsight](https://twitter.com/0Hindsight)\n* [Elad](https://twitter.com/eladmallel)\n* [Jarmen](https://twitter.com/jarmen43)\n* [Maty](https://twitter.com/matyETH)\n* [Adrianmcli](https://twitter.com/adrianmcli)\n\n___\n\n**A note on the 'Marketing Dept' creation**\n\n\nThe prop house round for 25 eth will award 5 submissions 5 eth to market this challenge and try and find people and teams outside both inside and outside of Nouns to make submissions. I will draft the prop house round if this proposal succeeds. An idea of submissions that will be encouraged are: contacting media schools, creating a landing pages with instructions, engaging with influencers to promote etc. \n\n___\n\n\n**Why YouTube Views**\n\n\nAs stated earlier, YouTube views are not everything, but they do matter and after looking at the view count of Nouns content I think we could benefit from a proposal with a proposal that has goals in terms of distribution as well as production. \n\nMany of these videos will have more views on Twitter and other platforms and I would expect the same from any video created for this challenge. But for the interest of managing the proposal we will have to set one medium as the primary one for measurement and I think YouTube is the most appropriate.\n\n2k views to reach the minimum entry requirement may seem small, and it is, but remember this is a MINIMUM, and we would expect any video that qualifies in the Top 10 to have many more views than that. \n\nHere you can see how many views Nounish content is currently getting on YouTube\n[![YT-V.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/XYSbwxm9/YT-V.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/bsTWP0zv)\n\nWhile some content that that use gimmicks, shows a lack of creativity nor effort, or does not show a clear comprehension of what the Nouns ecosystem is may meet the minimum qualifying criteria (whether due to the creator having large existing YouTube following or otherwise), ultimately the winning pieces of content be decided upon by a Nouner vote and so are extremely unlikely to be awarded anything for their efforts.

See my Tenor page https://tenor.com/users/coralorca\n* Side proliferation on large social networks with common keywords. Get traffic by appearing on top of the \"Retainer\" and \"Fire Hydrant\" search engine for billions of users.\n\n## **SCOPE: TIKTOK + INSTAGRAM + SNAP**\n\nI initially received funding from NSFW to create the AR glasses on Snapchat, then won two Prophouse rounds ([round 5](https://prop.house/nouns/round-5/498) and [round 7](https://prop.house/nouns/round-7/860)) which funded 8 additional filters bringing the total on Snapchat to 13.\n\nThe frog head has been ported to TikTok and Instagram as a feasibility test.\n\n\nFor this proposal I will create: \n\n\n**- 50 Noun heads on TikTok with the ability to switch between the 23 glasses colors using a simple screen tap.**\nCreating these requires [Effect House](https://effecthouse.tiktok.com/), TikTok’s AR filter authoring tool.\n>🐸 [Try the TikTok frog head](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMF92trdt/) \n\n![](https://imgur.com/2GCssla.jpeg)\n\n###### The TikTok Frog effect has been played over 5000 times since its publication on 11/24/22 (without any marketing)\n\n---\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**- 50 Noun heads on Instagram with the ability to switch between the 23 glasses colors using a simple screen tap.**\nCreating these requires [SparkAR](https://sparkar.facebook.com/ar-studio), Meta’s AR filter authoring tool.\n\n>🐸 [Try the Instagram frog head](https://www.instagram.com/ar/667609521529085)\n>Also available on [FB](https://www.facebook.com/fbcameraeffects/tryit/667609521529085/) and [Messenger video calling](https://www.messenger.com/ar/667609521529085)\n\n![](https://imgur.com/vVXc6G7.jpeg)\n\n###### Instagram video preview\n\n---\n\n\n\n\n**- 37 additional Noun heads on Snapchat (bringing the total published on Snapchat to 50) with the ability to switch between 23 glasses colors using a simple screen tap.** \nCreating these requires [Studio Lens](https://ar.snap.com/lens-studio), Snap's AR filter authoring tool.\n\nSnap Lenses are particularly interesting because they:\n- Integrate seamlessly with Discord, Zoom, Twitch, Google Hangout, OBS etc. using the free [Snap Camera](https://snapcamera.snapchat.com/) desktop application. See this [Youtube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWIZn\\_-oFig) I made if you want to learn how to do it.\n- Have advanced face tracking features with seamless animations\n\n> 🐸 Try the Snap Frog head [here](https://www.snapchat.com/unlock/?type=SNAPCODE&uuid=8cbf1be819ec4a888f6917453a1d17c8&metadata=01)\n🦈 Try the Snap Shark head [here](https://www.snapchat.com/unlock/?type=SNAPCODE&uuid=a1839d8ba0074f49882af6378ab63577&metadata=01)\n🤖 Try the Snap Robot head [here](https://www.snapchat.com/unlock/?type=SNAPCODE&uuid=102be3194e2d49fb83d297e4b9d18103&metadata=01)\n(You can use your phone and the Snapchat app or your desktop with [Snap camera](https://snapcamera.snapchat.com/))\n\n![](https://imgur.com/M5Ybldo.jpeg)\n\n###### Over 13 heads created on the Snapchat platform, see [creator page](https://lensstudio.snapchat.com/creator/6y\\_fgP0Vr6RqaJt3jIJLRw).\n\n---\n\n## **PROCESS**\n\n![](https://imgur.com/dsON2XB.jpeg)\n\n###### Consistency across the different authoring software: Snap’s *Lens Studio*, Meta’s *SparkAR*, and TikTok’s *Effect House*.\n\nI have been optimizing this pipeline for some time, and each trait needs custom animations depending on its shape. The geometry has to be considered individually, and some traits are more challenging than others. This is a similar process to what I went through when translating all 2D Nouns to 3D voxels with 3Dnouns.com. You can speed up the pipeline with work habits and experience, but each head requires specific attention to craft the Nounish details that make the difference.\n\n## **METRICS**\nI will share metrics from the different social platforms with the community.\nHere are some metrics from the Snapchat filters created with Prophouse funding and some recently published filters on TikTok.\n\n#### TIKTOK\n![](https://imgur.com/Qdb7oSX.jpeg)\n###### Close to 20k plays in two weeks with 0 marketing.\n\n#### SNAPCHAT\n\n![](https://imgur.com/PFoW7Ri.jpeg)\n\n###### The Robot Noun’s head has almost 600k plays in November! This is an interesting case of side effect proliferation. \n\n![](https://imgur.com/T1NMuqt.jpeg)\n\n###### BudLight was the first filter created, and currently totals over 4k plays.\n\n\n\n\n\n## **PORTING MODELS TO INSTAGRAM AND TIKTOK**\nI will import the 50 models to Meta’s and TikTok’s AR authoring software (respectively *SparkAR* and *Effect House*) to publish them to Instagram, Messenger, Facebook, and TikTok and reach a wider audience. \nRegarding the workflow, the 3D assets will be re-used, however, they still need to be imported, positioned, scaled, lit and the animation triggers need to be configured on an individual basis and depending on each software capabilities. \nFrom a technical standpoint Snap Lens Studio > SparkAR > TikTok Effect house. My goal is to make each Noun head as consistent as technically possible across all different platforms. See Frog head above.\n\n## **WHICH NOUN AND WHEN**\nI will deliver between 10 and 20 heads per month, released on the three platforms simultaneously as they are created. I will create community requested heads first, and otherwise will craft the traits that I think will be the most successful. \n👉Here is an open To-do if you want to add your favorite traits to the list: \nhttps://www.notion.so/Filters-List-1b12bdc8b51e42f4b726b650b3784f7a\n\n![](https://imgur.com/lrjR7ac.jpeg)\n\n###### Potential AR Filters candidates \n\n## **COMPENSATION**\nFor the Prophouse winning rounds, I suggested 4 filters for 2 ETH, when ETH was around 1800-2000 USD. The market price for such 3D AR lenses sits between 1500-5000 USD per filter. \nFor reference, [this MAYC filter I created](https://www.instagram.com/ar/1025321405001469/) was commissioned by LollaPalooza for Snapchat and IG and was around 5k USD - It is a little more complex with many eyes and snot coming out of the nose.\n\nWith ETH currently around 1200 USD, I adjusted the price to 3 filters for 2 ETH, around 800 USD.\n\n- Setting up the geometry and creating the expressions system for each of the 37 heads in Blender.\n**(37/3) * 2 = 24.7**\n\n- Porting the geometry to TikTok, Instagram, Snapchat, setting up the animation triggers and publishing to these platform with consistent tagging and video previews.\nI am estimating this work at 0.18 ETH per filter for a total of 137 filters.\n**(50 on TikTok + 50 on Instagram + 37 on Snapchat) * 0.18 = 24.7**\n\nThis brings the total ask at **49.4 ETH** with an average price of 0.36 ETH per filter. \n\n---\n\n## **ETH ADDRESS**\n\n0x9c74aE08Fd4337E14786f086D911E964df35e623\n\n## **WHO I AM**\n\n![](https://imgur.com/jmO7FHf.jpeg)\n\nCoral Orca:\n- Community member \n- Early Nouncillor\n- 3D buildor: visualization with voxels, AR and VR, architecture and art. \n- [Prop 2](https://nouns.wtf/vote/2) we created [https://3dnouns.com](https://3dnouns.com/) with [0xFloyd](https://twitter.com/0xfloyd)\n- [Prop 126](https://nouns.wtf/vote/126) With [John Hamon](https://twitter.com/johnhamon_)\n\nHappy to be here, and build with my internet friends. \n\nThank you for reading this proposal!\n\nFeel free to tag me on Twitter or Discord to answer any questions.

Over that time period, Prop House has become a core piece of infrastructure for the development of the Nouns ecosystem – onboarding a sizable percentage of the most impactful builders while spreading the Nouns meme far and wide. We are requesting 570 ETH to continue to fund development of Prop House over the next 6 months (Jan ‘23 - Jun ‘23).*\n\n---\n\n***State of the Prop House(s):**\nOn Dec 1st, 2022, Seneca hosted an open call to update the community on what we’ve been up to since the [proposal #105](https://nouns.wtf/vote/105). You can view the [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1TbJsbXWCPxbMyE25Xr_kfQjJJYMtGw0HEYuLrtdkndI/edit?usp=sharing) and recording of the talk [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qD9v1ihIRmw).*\n\n---\n\n## Onboarding builders\nThe most important outcome of Prop House for Nouns has been its ability to onboard a large percentage of the most impactful builders in the ecosystem. **More than funding, the core feature of Prop House is about activating builders**. Whether it be for folks who had never heard of Nouns before or those who were just hanging around, Prop House was the mechanism that took them from inactive to building within the ecosystem.\n\nGiven Nouns is about bottom-up brand building as opposed to top-down centralized direction, we hope that Prop House can continue to serve as a tool to execute on that Nouns vision. Below is a list of some of the builders who’ve been activated by Prop House:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/2ZeeWk9.png)\n\n## Where we are today by the numbers\nOur last proposal ([#105](https://nouns.wtf/vote/105)) passed on July 18, 2022. Since then, we’ve made substantial progress on all core Prop House KPIs:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/JtrkRUm.png)\n\nAll our charts are seeing sustained month-over-month growth despite market downturns:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/fBw6qTd.jpg)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/P5rXSsH.jpg)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/4q3e9hS.jpg)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/jr1bwSR.jpg)\n\nThe funnel from prop award to prop completion has maintained a high conversion rate. Close to 85% of all prop winners go on to complete their proposed work. Below is an analysis on all prop winners from all funding rounds within the [Nouns house](https://prop.house/nouns) (18 funding rounds and 105 awarded proposals):\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/H71CV2j.jpg)\n\n## Spreading the Nouns meme\nOver the past 5 months we’ve onboarded several communities, most notably [Meebits](https://prop.house/meebits) via [Ape Coin DAO funding](https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-110-meebits-prophouse-sponsored-by-apecoin/8219). By doing so, Prop House has spread the Nouns meme far beyond our immediate community. In tandem with Prop House growth comes furthering the reach of the Nouns meme along with what Nouns stands for: building.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/nTQsPIo.jpg)\n\n## Product\nThe Prop House team has been busy working on the core product ([prop.house](https://prop.house)). A brief summary of what we’ve done follows:\n\n- Contracted one the best designers in the space (0xHab from Rainbow)\n- Revamped UI across the entire app\n- Implemented multi-round houses\n- Upgraded voting UX\n- Open sourced the [repository](https://github.com/Prop-House/prop-house-monorepo/).\n- Released a [GraphQL interface](https://prod.backend.prop.house/graphql) for Prop House data which lead to projects like [NounsAtlas](https://nounsatlas.com), [Voters.wtf](https://voters.wtf) and [Nounish.cv](https://nounish.netlify.app/)\n\n## Protocol\nWe’ve also made strides in the development of the Prop House protocol.\n\nThe protocol leverages both Ethereum and Starknet in an effort to provide the best possible user experience. This dual-chain architecture enables Prop House users to propose and vote by signing a message, while decentralizing the entire funding flow.\n\nWe use Ethereum as the operations and execution layer, where houses are managed and payouts are made, while Starknet handles all user actions that occur within a funding round.\n\nAll of the code is publicly available today in the [Prop House repository](https://github.com/Prop-House/prop-house-monorepo/tree/protocol).\n\nBelow are some of the core pieces of infrastructure we’ve developed to support the protocol, where we are currently, and what to expect as we near mainnet launch:\n\n- The [protocol](https://github.com/Prop-House/prop-house-monorepo/tree/protocol/packages/prop-house-contracts) itself, which has been deployed to Goerli.\n- The [Prop House SDK](https://github.com/Prop-House/prop-house-monorepo/tree/protocol/packages/prop-house-sdk), which simplifies interaction with the protocol (L1 & L2).\n- The Starknet Relayer, which is responsible for submitting signed proposals and votes to Starknet on behalf of users.\n- Ethereum & Starknet subgraphs, which are currently in development.\n- Current blockers:\n    - [Cairo V1 Migration](https://medium.com/starkware/open-sourcing-cairo-1-0-b3100a664bb0)\n    - [Support for V1 on StarkNet](https://medium.com/starkware/starknet-regenesis-the-plan-bd0219843ef4) (expected Q1 ‘23)\n    - Protocol audits (pending testing on testnet)\n\nAssuming no major hiccups, we aim to deploy the protocol to mainnet before the end of Q1 2023.\n\n## Financials\n*The Prop House financials doc is publicly available [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iKGgedZmAzMNCFkd2PqjBd-ZgutrOjuYqfirDG1wS3g/edit?usp=sharing)*\n\nOver the course of one year and three proposals ([#23](https://nouns.wtf/vote/23), [#62](https://nouns.wtf/vote/62), [#105](https://nouns.wtf/vote/105)), Nouns DAO has funded the Prop House team 555 ETH for deploying towards Nouns builders and 695 ETH for development and operating expenses.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/oxC4c8l.png)\n\n*Note: current burn rate for Nouns funding rounds is low (~20-30 ETH / mo). If at any point the DAO chooses to have another party deploy Nouns House Funding, we will return all remaining funds to the DAO.*\n\n## What’s next?\n### Protocol launch\nWe are aiming for a mainnet launch by the end of Q1 2023. What follows is the timeline we are executing against to get to launch:\n\n- Migrate to Cairo V1\n- Complete Goerli testing\n- Finalize Prop House SDK & Starknet Relayer\n- Launch subgraphs for Ethereum & Starknet\n- Developer documentation\n- Protocol audit\n\n### Product development\nAlongside the transition to the protocol as the data layer, we will continue to develop the UX of app:\n- Core UX: better proposing, discovery and voting user experiences.\n- The launch of house and round managers such that anyone can create a house, deposit funds and initiate funding rounds.\n- Implementation for infinite rounds for grant pods to run their entire operation via Prop House.\n- Develop social features for communities. \n\n## Sustainability\nThere are several avenues to explore on how to make Prop House sustainable. For the time being, we are continuing to pursue funding by Nouns DAO as we believe it to be a positive sum engagement. Below we dive into potential avenues:\n\n### Nouns DAO funded (current)\nTo date, Nouns DAO has funded development costs of Prop House over the past ~12 months (695 ETH). For the current model to continue to work, Nouners would have to agree that the value created for Nouns by Prop House is higher than that of the development costs. In this framing, Nouns DAO is a patron to Prop house where its ROI is the onboarding of high impact builders, the attention generated by Prop House as public infrastructure by Nouns DAO and it being infrastructure for Nouns to run on.\n\n### Fees for usage\nThe true and tried approach is turning on fees at the client and/or protocol. This approach would require a substantial increase in volume (to the order of about 50-100x) to maintain current burn rates. So while feasible, it is not a solution for the short term. \n\n### Experimental\n**Nounish DAO**\nIn prop [#105](https://nouns.wtf/vote/105), we posed Prop House DAO as a plausible avenue to making Prop House sustainable. While it is still a potential route, there are concerns as to whether or not the DAO makes sense at all. At the core of it is whether the Nouns DAO format is appropriate for non-purely meme driven protocols. There’s also the question of whether every protocol needs a DAO and a corresponding governance token. So while the DAO is not out of the question, we believe that with experiments like [Nouns Builder](https://nouns.build/), the answer will become clearer over time. \n**Pure Meme NFTs**\nThere’s a case to be made where Prop House NFTs are minted to hold provenance value. This alone could capture long-term upside in the same way a visual artist and their collectors do. \n\n## Funding Request\n570 ETH to fund development of Prop House protocol & client over the next 6 months (Jan ‘23 - Jun ‘23). \n- 486 ETH: 3 engineers, 1 designer and 1 all hats.\n- 84 ETH for OpEx including contractors, infra, audits, bounties, translators, etc.\n\nFunds would be received by the [Prop House team multi-sig (3/5)](https://app.safe.global/eth:0x5BcD6f3B0a5519D448FBDf33204091bbE097C992/) where the signers are Seneca, Solimander, CDT, VapeApe and Devcarrot.","proposer":"0x177751396D8236569C5C7B04232C7b7281a3B9f3","startBlock":16149901,"endBlock":16185901,"executed":true},"votes":[{"support":2,"voter":"0x86030dbbCe1c771Ff6622C20455cd3619aa93c05","numberOfVotes":60,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x55b0a25d697647281553a177321DAd0a0Bf9A148","numberOfVotes":2,"reason":"This is an actual no brainer.

Recent events have highlighted the dire need and importance of such work. This prop proposes to fund 100 ETH to their donation address: zachxbt.eth (address can be verified from their twitter profile).\n\nDonations have always been somewhat controversial within Nouns governance. [Prop 21](https://nouns.wtf/vote/21) donating 169 ETH to Gitcoin grants was one of the most contentious votes in our early history. [Prop 108](https://nouns.wtf/vote/108) donating 500 ETH to Ethereum protocol development (via the Protocol Guild) was much more unanimous but still there was discomfort and discourse around whether the DAO was becoming \"a tax inefficient way for DAO members to make donations.\"\n\nI agree that we shouldn't resort to becoming a complacent vehicle of passive philanthropy. We should instead aim to actively contribute and be a net producer of public goods ourselves such that our meme (brand) can fully capture the provenance value (claim on originality of) the public work and thus leverage the virtuous cycle to do more than what capital alone could have done. However, there should be exceptions to this rule if there is an urgent and common public cause that warrants highlighting. I would like to suggest that this is such a case. Crypto needs more validators like ZachXBT.\n\nWith donations we need to be extra wary of conflicts of interest or self-dealing. Unfortunately there is no way to prove this cryptographically, but I attest that I have no prior (or planned future) relationship with ZachXBT and that today was the first time I contacted them (via twitter) to ask for their permission to make this proposal.","proposer":"0xa555d1Ee16780B2d414eD97f4f169c0740099615","startBlock":16155738,"endBlock":16191738,"executed":true},"votes":[{"support":1,"voter":"0x8BecD7EbF3F910090f9264DFD0Bb221Ea04af8c3","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":"Duh"},{"support":1,"voter":"0x5D802e2Fe48392c104Ce0401C7ECa8a4456f1F16","numberOfVotes":23,"reason":"https://postimg.cc/XXxzy5Cm"},{"support":1,"voter":"0x86030dbbCe1c771Ff6622C20455cd3619aa93c05","numberOfVotes":60,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x5ee24Cf78aeB5213F06C4ED718c7bbEF6fe1209E","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0xA86882277E69FbF0a51805cdc8b0a3a113079E63","numberOfVotes":2,"reason":"https://create.zora.co/collections/0xb6e8e1b617a10f0123c9bd57011493754ff6a361"},{"support":1,"voter":"0x1e66a3D0a6A327b1F29e8ACf3a3d9E1E4E088683","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0xa903C06BF35286f6d1cDAD25396748353979a44C","numberOfVotes":2,"reason":"I voted yes on the cancelled prop and I’m voting yes again.\nThis is something we were hoping to do through tings.wtf so it’s amazing to see more attention and larger treasury to allocate funds to a public good like this.\nVery nounish ⌐◨-◨ "},{"support":1,"voter":"0x1766255E71A11f9f9D13aBE3f2840E3f6942Aa29","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":"Protect Zach at all costs."},{"support":0,"voter":"0xAEC4075e4fc8cE829BC4f0cFD5e2fA10dd2b12D1","numberOfVotes":2,"reason":"Voting against since I had in thr first iteration of the prop.

Additionally, a portion will be distributed as gaming competition prizes.\n- [Gnars](https://twitter.com/gnars_dao)\n    - Proposed use: Extreme athletes could wear these in social media posts, at IRL events, and in interviews.

We want to make governance participation fun. \n\nOur vision is to create a governance platform that is both delightful and easy to use, empowering voters to effectively govern NounsDAO. The client is being created on top of an upcoming open-source framework, built by nounish developers, for nounish developers.\n\n# Current progress\n\nWe've had early success with [House of Nouns](https://houseofnouns.wtf/), with many Nouners and non-Nouners alike expressing their love of the intuitive interface. We want to continue building on this success and make it easier for people to participate in governance in an engaging way.\n\n![Screen Shot 2022-12-07 at 9.40.34 PM.png](https://imgur.com/D7F1Q0a.png)\n\nNot familiar with House of Nouns? You can discuss proposals with others, view important context, and vote all in one intuitive interface on [https://houseofnouns.wtf](https://houseofnouns.wtf). \n\n**Some data:** \n\n- MAUs - growing 100% month / month\n    \n    ![Screen Shot 2022-12-08 at 7.03.38 PM.png](https://imgur.com/aKCSwBO.png)\n    \n- Working with Nouns, Lil Nouns, and Gnars. In talks with many more communities.\n    \n    [https://houseoflilnouns.wtf](https://houseoflilnouns.wtf/proposals/69)\n    \n    [https://gnars.house](https://gnars.house) \n    \n- ~13.5% registered-user market penetration\n    - 170 registered users / 1263 total members in Nouns (delegates + Nouners + anyone who has voted or made a proposal on-chain or in Prop House)\n\n# **Core vision and goals**\n\nOur vision is to make it easier for voters to participate in Nouns governance by providing rich context, intuitive conversation tools, and seamless integrations with other Nounish platforms. This will be built on top of an open framework, empowering developers and solving impactful problems specific to nounish governance. \n\nIn short:\n\n- Provide all context on proposals, voters, builders, and team members, and view all conversations from Discord, Twitter, and Discourse in one place\n- Build a custom forum client directly into HoN that is backwards compatible w/Discourse, allowing users to create and discuss proposal drafts and get early feedback\n- Provide first-class support for Nouns forks and Prop House, and deeper integrations with Atlas, Federation and Agora\n- Create the open source House of Nouns framework, serving core data displayed on the site through a GraphQL API, paired with a developer friendly SDK for building on top of House of Nouns infrastructure\n\n## Product Breakdown\n\n### **Context layer**\n\nWe will attach more information to proposals, such as FAQs, comments, relevant links, conversations from other platforms, video attachments, and more. We're currently working with @maty.eth on integrating data from [proposals.wtf](http://proposals.wtf). \n\n![Screen Shot 2022-12-09 at 1.20.48 PM.png](https://imgur.com/NWxsu7o.png)\n\nWe also will provide more context on Nouners, builders, and team members, such as their past proposals, voting record, and Agora profile, directly in HoN. \n\n![Screen Shot 2022-12-07 at 9.35.06 PM.png](https://imgur.com/b8zipr3.png)\n\nAfter a proposal is executed, we will make it easy to see what has been delivered as a result.\n\n### Forums + conversation stack\n\nWe're building an alternative forum client like Discourse that pulls data from Discourse, and integrates token signaling and Ethereum-based identities. This will be built into House of Nouns and will allow users to create and discuss proposal drafts, get early feedback, and graduate drafts to proposals. It will also provide context on builders and [members](https://collective.xyz/nouns/members), and allow token-based voting.\n\n![Screen Shot 2022-12-09 at 1.19.55 PM.png](https://imgur.com/oXSPL8Y.png)\n\nWe also want to provide more intuitive ways to get early community consensus, such as upvote/idea boards. This will allow users to easily move from an idea to a draft proposal, get comments, and then move to an on-chain proposal with ongoing comments and voting.\n\n### Integrations\n\nDeeper integrations with other Nounish products like Nouns Atlas and Nouns Agora. \n\nView conversation from Discord, Twitter, Discourse etc. in-line on [houseofnouns.wtf](http://houseofnouns.wtf). \n\nFirst class support for Nouns forks, Prop House, Federation, and other governance sources\n\n- one-click governance clients for Nouns forks\n- vote on Prop House rounds directly in HoN with intuitive and easy UI\n- Federation integration (ex: vote on HoN as a Gnars holder)\n\nWhile we will make sure our infrastructure can support all Nounish communities, we will focus on solving problems specific to Nouns governance in the next 6 months. We believe this is where we can have the biggest impact.\n\n## House of Nouns Framework\n\nWe are building an open source framework to give builders the tools they need to build custom governance and discussion experiences for their communities. We will build House of Nouns on top of this framework, in a similar vein to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) being both a builder and end-user of NextJS. \n\nThe main components of the framework are:\n\nOpen access to core data displayed on the site through a GraphQL API.\n\nReact [SDK](https://github.com/collectivexyz/sdk) for developing on top of House of Nouns infrastructure, including hooks to access data, pre-built components etc. \n\n## Differentiation\n\nAgora approaches the problem of low governance participation from the delegation perspective. Don’t want to vote? Delegate to someone to do it for you. \n\nHouse of Nouns approaches it from the conversation and context-aggregation perspective.  Empowering Nouners to vote independently and be empowered to think for themselves. \n\nBoth approaches are valid and necessary for the ecosystem to grow. We will be working closely with Agora to ensure we don’t build the same things and otherwise waste valuable energy. \n\n## Success Metrics\n\nOur goal is to have 30% or more of the Nounish ecosystem using (voting/discussing/viewing) House of Nouns *every week*. Currently, about 14% are registered users. We believe that with further improvements to the proposal conversation stack and better user experience, we can reach this goal. \n\nUltimately, our goal is to have the House of Nouns framework and SDK integrated into 10 or more clients by July 2023.\n\nWe will use these as the two primary metrics to evaluate our success in 6 months.\n\n# **Transparency & decentralization**\n\nAs a governance platform, we want to avoid centralization of power by taking the following measures:\n\n- Building the House of Nouns framework as an open source public good\n    - Offer up all data through APIs and a developer friendly SDK\n    - Transition discussion data to open data layers as soon as an attractive option has wide adoption / traction\n    - Offer a React SDK for components and data fetching\n- Current House of Nouns team members added together will commit to not represent more than 5% of NounsDAO.\n\nOur goal is to open-source the core building blocks of governance and discussion, and provide killer developer tooling on top of the HoN rails so anyone can build custom experiences for their communities and subcultures. \n\n## Sustainability\n\nWe plan to generate revenue by offering bespoke upgrades to other DAOs similar to Red Hat, as well as charging hosting costs for larger communities. Our goal is for the HoN client to become self-sustainable within 12-16 months. These upgrades will be built into the broader platform and framework for all users. \n\nFor the HoN framework, we’re exploring alternative public goods funding routes (Nouns model, Gitcoin etc.) so we can be empowered to continue building something maximally useful for the entire ecosystem. \n\n# ********Team********\n\nWe are a small startup [(collective.xyz)](https://twitter.com/collectivexyz) that has been building for Nouns and won the governance client mandate [round](https://prop.house/nouns/nouns-governance-clients) 3 months ago. \n\nHouse of Nouns team:\n\n[dadkins](https://twitter.com/dadkins_) - 9 years in software, longtime crypto hacker, cofounder [@collective.xyz](https://twitter.com/collective.xyz)\n\nwhise - lead data engineer ex: Amazon / longtime buildor\n\n[Wojciech](https://kocjan.net/) - Killer product engineer, built [nounslaunchpad.wtf](https://nounslaunchpad.wtf)\n\n[Tim G](https://github.com/timmyg) - former head of engineering at crypto startup, full stack maestro\n\nwith support from [rocketman](https://twitter.com/rocketman_w) and [jac](https://github.com/jac18281828)\n\n# Funding Request\n\nWe compare closely to other proposals, like [Agora’s 3-month proposal](https://houseofnouns.xyz/proposals/154) (170 ETH for a team of 4 for 3 months (14 ETH per mo./ person), or Nouns AI Pod (12.75 ETH per mo./ person). \n\nWe request 340 ETH in USDC to fund development of House of Nouns framework & client over the next 6 months (Jan ‘23 - Jun ‘23).\n\n• 330 ETH: 4+ engineers (13.75 ETH per mo./ person)\n\n• 10 ETH: funding for Prop House round(s) to build out alternative clients and views into governance+discussion on top of the HoN framework.  \n\n50% deposited immediately to the teams wallet via [USDC payments contract](https://nouns.wtf/vote/172).\n\n50% USDC streamed over a period of 6 months from a 3/5 multisig held by trusted members of the community.

The status of each Noun will change throughout the day and you can tend to it accordingly to keep it alive, happy, and healthy.\n\n## Introduction & Background\n---\nHello Everyone,\n\nI'm Jeff (aka heyjeff.eth, jefe) and I’ve been developing an app over the past year that aims to engage NFT collectors by bringing their NFTs to life. Quick backstory:\n\nThe concept was inspired by the popular Japanese phenomenon ‘Tamagotchi’ released in the late 90’s. Each handheld device contains a virtual friend the user must tend to in order to keep it alive, happy, and healthy. Interestingly enough, it’s a style of game that you don’t necessarily ‘beat’ or ‘win’. It’s more of an experience of having a buddy that you can play with, care for, and watch grow throughout it’s lifespan, forever.\n\nI thought it’d be fun if people could do the same with their NFTs, so I decided to build a prototype. At first it started out as just a silly napkin sketch, but now we’re proud to say we’ve recently finished adding support for all 6,969 CrypToadz, each with 11 unique animations totaling over 75,000 files! *(That’s 7.6 GB of raw toad data)*. For those who own a CrypToad, you can check out the app [here](https://tinycitizen.xyz).\n\nHere’s some footage:\n[![CrypToadz Gameplay](https://i.imgur.com/KHs4MZi.png)](https://vimeo.com/780511900)\n\n\n## Motivation and Goals\n---\nWhat we’re aiming to do is leverage the tech we’ve developed for CrypToadz and adapt it to build tools so that anyone can generate, access, and download Nounish animations on demand for cc0 use.\n\nTo do this, we’ll develop an easy-to-use Build-a-Noun app through which anyone can choose a pre-existing Noun or build their own by mixing and matching traits at will or at random. Users will be able to preview animations on the fly and then instantly download any or all of the animations they like, with the option of exporting the individual animation frames as well. The app is future-proofed too, so every Noun that is born each day will be readily accessible.\n\nNot only that, but any animation for any Noun configuration can be easily accessible via a back-end API and/or a URL for developers to use in their web apps instantly and seamlessly.\n\nAs an added bonus, anyone can immediately interact and play with their Noun or custom Noun through our other interactive app we’ve already built!\n\nUltimately, the goal of all of this is to empower people to actively use Nouns in engaging, refreshing, and easy ways to help spread the meme.\n\n## Build-A-Noun App, prototype & poc\n(early prototype shown, does not represent final product)\n[![Build-A-Noun Prototype](https://i.imgur.com/Viv5UfU.jpg)](https://vimeo.com/777492078)\n\nThe 20 total actions and states are: idle (breathing/blinking), happy/loved, laughing, talking, dancing/head bob, eating: pizza, mushroom, veggies, fruit, hamburger, playing a gameboy, sad/crying, drinking: coffee, water, tea, health/mana potion, tired, sick, and sleeping.\n\nThe above is an early prototype solely to convey the concept of the Build-A-Noun app. The final product will have a redesigned and intuitive interface, with way more options and functionality, such as:\n* Select transparent or any background color (hex or rbg input)\n* Quick select any existing Noun ID config\n* Searchable traits by ID or name\n* Randomize traits button\n* Flip the animation (left-facing vs right-facing)\n* Change output animation speed\n* Apply an rbg tint to the animation\n* Apply a black and white filter to the animation\n* Resize animation to specific dimensions\n* Export all individual frames for a given animation\n* Pick and choose which animations to export\n* Add text overlays\n* Share-to-Twitter button to quickly tweet your creations \n\nFlipped![](https://i.imgur.com/bIxYeRQ.gif) B/w filter![](https://i.imgur.com/eI9okhg.gif)\nrbg(255, 5, 555) tint![](https://i.imgur.com/1n2f2xY.gif) Sped up 3x![](https://i.imgur.com/FsMU13t.gif) Flipped, 0.75x speed, rbg(293, 65, 5) tint![](https://i.imgur.com/AaLiqTR.gif)\n\n\n*Examples of animation customization options*\n\nIn total, we’d pre-generate 8,700 animation files (435 Nouns assets x 20 unique states), each with an average of 30 frames per animation. That's  a total of 261,000 individual frames to bring this vision to life! There are 23,377,200 possible combinations for a Noun, and 467,544,00 possible animations outcomes (23,377,200 x 20)!\n\n\n## Why?\n---\nCurrently, there isn't a scalable tool in the Nouniverse that allows users to quickly produce a wide range of highly customizable Nounish cc0 animations on demand.\n\nGame developers, content creators, and everyday users can benefit from such a tool as a building block to create even bigger and more Nounish things!\n\nWe're trying to fill this gap in the Nounscape by providing STOMMs (*Super Tool of Mass-Memeification*) in an area that is lacking. With this tool in place, I believe we'll see an explosion of new Nounish content for everyone to use and enjoy as they see fit.\n\nPlus, being able to interact with your Noun deepens our emotional connection to them!\n\n## Sneak Peeks\n---\nWe made the following animations for Lil Nouns for fun as a test, but the same concepts apply for Nouns. Here's a peek at 10 out of the 20 total states. Choose any background color you like, or none at all (transparent).\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/u0ZdEUw.gif)\nIdle\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/p9ecpWa.gif)\nEating pizza\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Ygk8hBI.gif)\nSleeping\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/euvT8qO.gif)\nPlaying Gameboy\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/CqHr6cL.gif)\nHappy\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Wnxg4Uj.gif)\nSad/Crying\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/1TBwth1.gif)\nDrinking coffee\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/LmXiVcz.gif)\nSick\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/qbxc4Wy.gif)\nTired\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/oIWI1F3.gif)\nHealth potion\n\n## Interactive App ~ Bonus ~\n---\nAnyone who owns a Noun or builds one with our Noun Builder app can interact with it on a daily basis through an app we've already built (works on mobile too)! Each Noun will be animated to reflect it's current state or action - it will truly feel like your Noun has come to life!\n\nHere are the following mechanics:\n\n4 Stats (each max val of 100):\n* Fullness\n* Energy\n* Happiness\n* Health\n\n3 Player Actions (each grants XP needed in order to level up):\n* Feeding – Increases fullness and happiness\n* Sleeping – Increases energy and health\n* Playing – Increases happiness, decreases fullness and energy\n\n3 Conditions:\n* Can’t sleep while starving\n* Can’t play while sleep-deprived\n* Can’t eat while sick\n\n3 Items (purchasable with points earned from completing actions)\n* Coffee – Triples the amount of XP gained, but cannot sleep for 8 hr\n* Health Potion – Replenishes health to full\n* Mushroom (can be easily reskinned to another object) – 1 of 4 potential effects, chosen at random:\n    * Jumbles stats at random\n    * Earn a random amount of XP\n    * Gain 1 level\n    * Eat a poisonous mushroom and die\n* All stats decay by 2 every 4 hours automatically, forever\n* Sometimes, at random, 1 of the 4 stats will be depleted to zero if all stats are non-zero\n* If neglected for ~8 days, the NFT will die\n* NFTs can be revived, but lose 1 level and costs points\n* Highest levels are ranked in a public leaderboard\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/PaRnHTs.gif)\n*Nounish interactive gameplay demo (limited features)*\n\n\n## How is this valuable to Nouns??\n---\n\n### 1. Public Goods & Network Effects\n\nEveryone from experienced devs to everyday users will be able to generate & access Nounish animations on demand, either through the API or the front-end tool within a few clicks.\n\nThis means anyone -- enthusiasts, developers, and/or content creators can save countless hours by bootstrapping these animations to be used any way they like! Some examples include: \n\n* Enrich existing apps or websites\n* Use as stickers and/or emojis for Discord servers\n* Use the animations to develop a game\n* Use them to make merch and/or NFTs\n* Enhance Nounish media like tweets, infographics, or videos\n* Use as pfps\n* Download the individual animation frames to make sprite sheets\n* Use the frame data to create lip-synced animated avatars for video/audio calls\n\n-- the possibilities are endless!\n\nThe end result will lead to quicker turnarounds for prototypes and media creations, and act as a catalyst for the proliferation of new Nounish content overall.\n\nQuote from devcarrot, Nounder:\n\"This sounds like a very fun idea, I love the animations. Would you be willing to make the data accessible to other developers via a public API? Maybe with something like a license that requires attribution? It could be interesting to have Nounish characters hanging out on the various projects’ sites; imagine Timpers’ disco floor but with TinyCitizen characters rendered in real time.\n\nThe disco floor:\n![](https://cdck-file-uploads-europe1.s3.dualstack.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/standard21/uploads/nouns/original/2X/a/a30c42ece4e30f7f4aac00f6979b82a057b19eb9.gif)\"\n\n\n### 2. Rally community around organic and fun reward systems\n\nThrough the interactive app we’ve already built, it provides opportunities for users to earn rewards through quests.\n\nAs an example, we’ve successfully rewarded 80+ unique CrypToadz players with a CrypToadz hat and pair of Nouns glasses to those who reached level 10 with a CrypToad through the interactive app. Everyone shared how much they loved this event!\n\nThis provides a more rewarding experience because the merch drop felt earned rather than simply given. In turn, it promotes camaraderie and a sense of fellowship among the community who want to achieve a mutual desired result by partaking in shared experiences.\n\nAny Nounish DAO that wishes to engage their audience can task their community with completing certain actions through the app and granting them an award upon completion.\n\n**Reward bundle: CrypToadz Hat + Noun Glasses + NFT NYC Coaster**\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Xupiot6.jpg)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/f8PToWz.jpg)\n\n*pssst… This event is still ongoing! If you want a CrypToadz hat and Nouns glasses you can still grind for them! Find me on Discord :wink:*\n\n### 3. Tap into & activate new creators and builders\nIf we make these assets readily available for people to access in an engaging and easy manner, it could open up doors for new people to enter the ecosystem.\n\nThose that need assets to build on Nouns in new or interesting ways but have no developer or animation experience can often feel discouraged not knowing where to start.\n\nWith the Build-A-Noun app as a building block, we can inspire existing Nounish community members as well as potential new ones to create something Nounish easily and quickly. Anyone can get up and running with tens, hundreds, or thousands of animations ready to use within minutes.\n\n\n## Deliverables\n---\n* Create an easy-to-use front-end tool + website where anyone can create and download unique cc0 gifs for any Noun configuration on the spot. The 20 unique states/actions are:\n    * Idle (breathing + blinking)\n    * Happy/Loved\n    * Sad/Crying\n    * Laughing\n    * Talking\n    * Sleeping\n    * Dancing/Head bob\n    * Eating\n        * pizza\n        * mushroom\n        * fruit\n        * veggies\n        * hamburger\n    * Drinking\n        * coffee\n        * water\n        * tea\n        * health potion\n        * mana potion\n    * Playing a gameboy\n    * Tired\n    * Sick\n* Create a back-end API, where anyone can instantly grab any animation for any Noun configuration for use in their web apps programmatically via an API key and/or a URL\n* Revamped front-end design with mobile-friendly version to generate animations on the go!\n* Integration with our existing free-to-play side-app where users can interact and play with their Nouns (already built)\n* Publicly host the raw base64 encoded png frame data for all Nouns assets in json format so anyone can use the animation frames how they like\n\n## Timeline\n---\n### Total: 10 weeks\n\nEach individual trait needs to be manually animated for all 20 states. That's roughly ~1,000 files per week (435 x 20 / 8). Some take shorter than others because they're static in a given animation, or they mimic the same motion as another animation and can be ported. Regardless, there is a lot of upfront work to be done.\n\n### Weeks 1-4:\nFront-end work, complete site redesign and development. Mobile-friendly optimization. Developing gif creation software with various customization options.\n\n~50% of animations files complete\n\n### Weeks 5-8:\nBack-end work on API creation. Work on image processing and manipulating animation frame data. Create hosting solution for animation data.\n\n~100% of animation files complete\n\n### Weeks 9 & 10:\nHook-up back-end to front-end. Allow 2 week buffer for testing & bug fixes, or any last minute optimizations/improvements.\n\n## Who we are\n---\n![](https://i.imgur.com/EkzLRN9.gif)**heyjeff.eth** - Full-Stack Dev / Design / Vision / Logistics\n\nI’m an engineer, problem-solver, and purveyor of ideas that I believe are worth telling.\n\nI've been involved in the NFT space since early 2021 and became Noun-pilled a couple months ago through some people I’ve met within the CrypToadz community.

We were fascinated by the Nouns protocol and community and soon began building out sharkish tools to ease some of the unique challenges of a Nounish subDAO. We created a dashboard for SharkDAO, which included widgets for a snapshot client, calendar, and token-gated document center. We wanted to build a simple interface for casual members to be able to quickly catch up on the latest in SharkDAO and Nouns. Soon after, other communities asked if they could have their own dashboards. We open-sourced the code, modularized the components, and invited other web3 groups to join. Today, we’d describe [Calabara](https://calabara.com/explore) as an open-source design house for public infrastructure and applications.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/V819CqQ.png)\n\n\nBy prop [62](https://nouns.wtf/vote/62), we began to get excited about many of the ideas being communicated by the Prop House team. We'd been thinking deeply about community funding protocols for some time ourselves, and were eager to experiment with the Prop House model. Unfortunately, we weren’t yet able to run our own Prop House rounds at SharkDAO (because we don’t use an erc721 for governance). Prop House wasn’t open-source yet, so we decided to fork the core ideas of Prop House and build something of our own: Creator Contests. \n\n## Creator Contests … WTF?\n\nCreator Contests are a nounish middleware for distributing funds to creatives.\n\nCreating scalable funding infrastructure at all levels is a critical building block in establishing Nouns as the world's largest open-source brand. Creator contests build upon the strong foundations developed by the Prop House team while experimenting with novel features to create unique incentive systems and new ways to fund builders – allowing any Nounish community with an ENS the ability to start running their own contests.\n\n## How does it work?\n\nSimilar to Prop House, participants create submissions in response to a contest prompt, and voters choose the best ones. Once the contest is over, funds are distributed to the winners. All contests follow this basic model, but administrators have full control over the contest settings to layer-on additional components. Here’s what we offer today …\n\n* Submitter Rewards\n    * Define 1 or more winning ranks (1st, 2nd, ... nth place)\n    * Define 1 or more rewards for listed ranks (ETH, ERC20, ERC721)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/LK2Vg12.png)\n\n* Voter Rewards\n    * Voters that accurately choose rank N submission will split X reward.\n    * Can be used to create unique incentive systems.\n    * NOMO-style games can be created, where voters join forces to try to choose the 2nd best submisison without pushing it to first place.\n![](https://i.imgur.com/IBwqCwI.png)\n\n* Participant Restrictions\n    * Token thresholds required for participants to submit or vote\n    ![](https://i.imgur.com/YcwFxhK.png)\n\n* Voting Strategies\n    * Token -- Voting power based on token holdings\n    * Arcade -- Uniform voting power for all qualifying voters\n    ![](https://i.imgur.com/KpVyBT8.png)\n\n* Twitter Integration\n    * Collect submissions via Twitter interactions\n    * Inherit all existing infrastructure while proliferating via Twitter\n    ![](https://i.imgur.com/0J7OkhJ.png)\n    ![](https://i.imgur.com/cDWuZ26.gif)\n    \n* Additional Parameters\n    * Vote total visibility\n    * Anonymous Submissions\n    * Self Voting\n  ![](https://i.imgur.com/jkCGMtY.png)\n\n\n## Our Nounish Journey: part 2\n\nBefore Spring 2022, we had bootstrapped the project ourselves. We were lucky enough to receive support from SharkDAO, and they funded us with 7 ETH to develop an MVP of Creator Contests. We launched our first contest in September, and have helped fund 45 nounish creatives with ~4 ETH and 25k ERC-20 tokens since. 2 months ago, we received a small grant of 8 ETH from NSFW to develop the Twitter Integration mentioned above. We have groups like SharkDAO, Composables, TNS, and the Society of Nounish Cartoonists running contests as we speak. We are now ready to take Creator Contests to the next level.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Fk7grjB.png)\n\n\n## Goals for the funding period\n\nFor this funding period, we’d like to focus on “Top of the funnel” funding infrastructure. This means implementing a scalable protocol for funding creatives in the 0.069 - 3 ETH range. Our goal is to fund 100+ nounish creatives in the 3-month window.\n\nWhile bringing the codebase out of “MVP mode” so it can sufficiently scale to other Nounish pods (and make it easier to fork), we’ll work on the following upgrades:\n\n* Support native video and other media formats\n* Add vote audit reports\n* Add voting capability for Noun delegates\n* Experiment with new voting strategies\n* Simplify contest initialization process.\n* Improve our twitter algorithms\n* UX redesign - It’s time for CC to get Nounish\n\n\nWe’d also like to answer the following questions:\n\n* Are voter rewards a feature or a bug?\n* In the voting period, how impactful are visible vote totals on a communities ability to choose the “best” submissions?\n* Does submission history serve as a relevant talent repository for other pods?\n* Are deep Twitter integrations viable for other tasks, like governance? (Nouncil, Nerman, etc)\n* Are there ways to maintain a certain level of submission quality without directly moderating submissions?\n    * Prop House already sees a certain percentage of “low quality” submissions, and we’ll see higher levels at this funding tier. Are there ways to ensure a certain quality standard without direct moderation? Learnings from this experimentation could be layered on top of Prop House and other applications.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Defining success\n\nSuccess at the funding tier we are targeting is tightly coupled with onboarding. We’ll define onboarding for the scope of this project as the following:\n\n* New creatives\n    * Introduce new creatives to Nouns and extension communities\n* Existing creatives to larger funding tiers\n    * Support creatives in the earliest stages of ideation that can translate to quality Prop House or NSFW proposals\n* Between Nounish extension communities\n    * Increase the discoverability factor of extension projects and communities through different contest designs and synergies, i.e.\n        * TNS and Composables co-host a round\n        * Multi-community voting\n        * Twitter contests\n\nOf course, success for us also hinders on our ability to proliferate the meme. Twitter integrations drastically increase our proliferation potential -- elevating contests from a siloed web app to a publicly discoverable and interactable experience. We're focused on lifting the stack as close to the \"public edge\" as possible and see the potential for these integrations in other Nounish areas.  \n\nDefining success is one thing, measuring it is different. For this funding term, we’ll do so manually by following up with participants and winners while exploring ways we can automate and better measure this in the future.\n\n\n## Prop House\n\n*Why not just fork Prop House for real?*\n\nWhile we haven’t really heard this much, it’s a valid question that we anticipate some Nouners might have.\n\nHalting further experimentation to go back and layer our changes on top of the PH codebase feels like a step backwards at this point in time. We envision a coordinated approach where both PH and CC are able to sandbox and test different ideas and merge the ones that work. Ultimately, the far more relevant component to fork will be the smart contracts for a trustless implementation that the PH team is leading, which we fully plan on doing. \n\nAt worst, CC is an alternative client for Prop House. At best, it is an experiment in funding infrastructure, working alongside Prop House in developing sound protocols for high velocity, trustless, and scalable funding infrastructure for web3 communities – all powered by Nouns.\n\n## Team\n\nWeez: frontend, designer, UX, support\nNick: lead dev, fullstack\n\n## Links\n* [Calabara](https://calabara.com/explore)\n* [Github](https://github.com/calabara-hq/calabara)\n* [Twitter](https://twitter.com/calabarahq)\n\n## Budget\n\n60 ETH for continued development\n\n3/5 Multisig tasked with sending 30 ETH of project funds to the team wallet upon execution, and setting up a 3-month stream for the remaining funds.\n\nSigners:\n\nNick: nickdodson.eth\nBenbodhi: signed.benbodhi.eth\nJuan: juanx.eth\nJoshuaFisher: joshuafisher.eth\nToadyHawk: toadyhawk.eth\n\n\n## Proposed Transactions\n\n0x55d1f4091Ced357cD4C4F9dd12531b8fDBe2dd26.transfer(\n    60.0 ETH\n)","proposer":"0x1e66a3D0a6A327b1F29e8ACf3a3d9E1E4E088683","startBlock":16191654,"endBlock":16227654,"executed":false},"votes":[{"support":2,"voter":"0x1e66a3D0a6A327b1F29e8ACf3a3d9E1E4E088683","numberOfVotes":2,"reason":"I fully support this proposal and would like to see it pass but am abstaining as I sponsored this prop on-chain."},{"support":0,"voter":"0xf8A065F287d91d77cD626AF38ffA220D9B552A2b","numberOfVotes":3,"reason":"Not sure we need an alternative to prop house, we need more proliferation and less tooling.

Let's explore some of the ways we plan on scaling:\n\n### Builder onboarding via seasonal Prop House rounds\n\nGnars DAO has attracted builders who've paved the way with their creative approaches to activating their communities. Many hail from emerging markets where we can have an outsized impact and their values are already closely aligned with ours as crypto natives.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/uYMx45z.png)\n\n[Prop House](https://prop.house) allows us to run mandated funding rounds each season that will see builders competing for the opportunity to uplift their respective communities. Each round will fund activations as described below and we've already received expressions of interest from suitable candidates throughout South America, Africa, Asia and more.\n\n### Public goods delivery through builder-led activations\n\nBuilders funded each round will be equipped with everything they need for public goods delivery through thoughtful and culturally relevant activations. Leaning on our experience in Brazil, we'll help motivated individuals become local heroes.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/56iuFKh.gif)\n\nOur community will help them to implement nounish obstacles, crypto wallets and NFTs (10% of Gnars are for onboarding), merch and stickers, photo walls and banners, and to receive delivery of remuneration, Noun 189 skateboards and various types of noggles.\n\n### Hashtag campaigns to catalyse social media curation\n\nWe're not looking for \"[flash in the pan](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/flash_in_the_pan)\" type events and are committed to the pursuit of the \"[nouns virtuous cycle](https://medium.com/@punk4156/the-nouns-virtuous-cycle-95586bb9c7c9).\" We will leverage hashtags like **#ThatsGnarly** across all platforms to launch ongoing crowd-sourced social media campaigns.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/B82OcJz.jpg)\n\nSuch a rudimentary approach removes all barriers to entry so that the first step in joining the movement is simply posting to a hashtag. We can meet newcomers where they already express themselves, curate the best content based on impact and prepare creators for [a Web3 revolution](https://thatsgnar.ly).\n\n### Creator onboarding to the Gnars Revolution protocol\n\n[Revolution](https://github.com/collectivexyz/revolution) is a protocol from [House of Nouns](https://houseofnouns.xyz) (and [gnars.house](https://gnars.house/)) designed to enable the earning of governance rights through contributions other than capital. We are working closely with the team to give Gnars holders a reddit-like curatorial experience for content submitted to #ThatsGnarly.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/wCsJkxJ.jpg)\n\nContent surfaces on a Web3 leaderboard at [thatsgnar.ly](https://thatsgnar.ly) after being submitted by extreme sports creators across social media. Competing in the \"gnarketplace\" for attention, top performing content is minted and sold as NBA Topshot style NFTs in daily auctions – *ie. Prop House for tricks.*\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/fxNEx13.jpg)\n\n*Trick NFTs released under CC0, Gnars NFTs drawn from 10% of supply already allocated to athlete/artist onboarding and each GNAR is equal to one Gnars DAO governance vote.*\n\n## 🚀 How we'll spend 694.20 ETH\n\nWe're a passionate community with domain expertise who know very well the agility required to succeed. Our plans are subject to change and funds will be disbursed through our own proven governance, but this should give you some idea of what to expect:\n\n### Activations\n\nSkateboard production and shipping, existing skate park refurbishments, localised merchandise production, Nouns Vision and Bigshot noggles, fabrication of more giant noggles and so much more.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/XQ5qksI.jpg)\n\n*Additional locations where sculpture installation is not allowed will be activated using NFC enabled \"⌐◨-◨\" beacons that prompt visitors to get involved.* \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/2OGWJ1z.jpg)\n\n*This is a rough mockup of small indestructible noggle fixtures that can be glued discreetly at existing spots without degrading an obstacle's user experience.*\n\n### Autonomy\n\nSince inception, our community have had access to Noun 189 in order to participate in Nouns DAO governance. The time has come for Gnars DAO to acquire two Nouns of their own. Enough funds to purchase 2 Nouns will be allocated to auction bidding.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/vD0S5Ty.gif)\n\nAdditional funds from our ongoing NFT auctions will bolster this funding request, further efforts laid out in this proposal, and allow us to continue onboarding professional team riders who represent us throughout their respective industries as ambassadors.\n\n### Contributors\n\nAs required we will provide remuneration through governance to top notch contributors already attracted to Gnars including [Gami](https://twitter.com/0xigami), [Alberto](https://twitter.com/alberto_campora), [Akva](https://twitter.com/Akva556), [Vlad](https://twitter.com/vladhzc), [Sam Mason de Caires](https://twitter.com/sammdec), [Brian](https://twitter.com/pbrianandj), [Rocketman](https://twitter.com/rocketman_w), [Benbodhi](https://twitter.com/benbodhi), [Davin](https://twitter.com/davinoyesigye), [Satori](https://twitter.com/0xSatori), [Lochie](https://twitter.com/lochieaxon) and [Knowhow92](https://twitter.com/theocharis_ch). We will approach these engagements on a competitive basis much like our activations. \n\nWe've been working hard to gain qualitative insight and to establish the most effective operational structure. As a community we have access to unrivalled industry expertise through our relationships with pro athletes, artists, media and brands. We look forward to inspiring many more of our connections through the very same thing that's gotten us to where we are – word of mouth.\n\n> 📝 **NOTE:** Funding receival to [gnars.eth](https://gnars.wtf/), a [gnosis safe](https://gnosis-safe.io/app/eth:0x0658f4eD17289144717713ADfFC2539eF7c2EF8e/settings/owners) multisig [governed by Gnars DAO](https://gnars.house/) members as described in [Proposal 51](https://nouns.wtf/vote/51) with backup signers being [Gami](https://twitter.com/0xigami), [Benbodhi](https://twitter.com/benbodhi), [Oni](https://twitter.com/apenoun), [Noun 22](https://twitter.com/undeadnoun22) and [Blockbird](https://twitter.com/_blockbird).\n\n## 🛹 We're built for onboarding\n\n[I recently asked nouns twitter](https://twitter.com/0xigami/status/1596051642725830656), \"what is the biggest problem with nouns dao that needs solving?\" I was delighted to receive a response [from 4156 directly](https://twitter.com/punk4156/status/1596061577794330624): \n\n> \"same as every other crypto token imo: distribution. how to onboard maximum number of high quality, aligned etc. participants into the network\"\n\nOnboarding is something we take seriously at Gnars and we are uniquely positioned to onboard the next million [proliferatooooors](https://create.zora.co/collections/0x8c5effc5fb5d3805212713115427f4efe82a40be) by staying \"extremely nounish\" and applying the true grit and perseverance we've learned through our commitment to action sports culture.\n\n### Questions?\n\nJoin [our Discord server](https://discord.gg/gnars), subscribe to [gnarly.news](https://gnarly.news/), check out [gnars.com](https://gnars.com), or boardslide into our DMs on Twitter [(@gnars_dao)](https://twitter.com/gnars_dao) or Instagram [(@gnarsdao)](https://www.instagram.com/gnarsdao/). \n\nThanks everynoun for taking the time to peruse this funding request.\n\n[Gami](https://twitter.com/0xigami), like origami.\n\n⌐◨-◨","proposer":"0x387a161C6b25aA854100aBaED39274e51aaffffd","startBlock":16194159,"endBlock":16230159,"executed":false},"votes":[{"support":1,"voter":"0xa903C06BF35286f6d1cDAD25396748353979a44C","numberOfVotes":2,"reason":"This proposal is of huge value to the DAO and the nounish culture in general.

Nouns arent a cheap NFT, 30E is like a full years salary for many in the US. \n\n- Gnars has daily auctions which give them ETH, they still have over 70E in their treasury to use (which is great given the 60ish we funded them with in the past). I feel gnars could be self sufficient and this proposal is asking for a large amount simply because it can. \n\n- With 3360 Gnars in circ, giving gnars dao 700E would 10x the book value of a gnar when a noun trades at half.

Similar to how the DAO added in [new head attributes](https://nouns.wtf/vote/125) via a proposal, Nouns can continue to explore and experiment with new models of CC0 art and production and minting directly from the DAO is a new tool for the organization to directly release and distribute the most important artifacts from the community. It’s not hard to see how this can advance Nouns into a crypto-native form of Movie Studio, Production House, Art Museum and so on.\n\nThis video will be released as a Timed Open Edition for a price of 0.05 ETH. This means it will be available for anyone to mint for the specified minting period, which will be open until the Rose Parade on January 2nd, 2023. The proceeds from sale will be split between Nouns (60%) and Ordinary Folk (40%).\n\nWe are excited to experiment with DAO NFT releases as an additional value capture mechanism, and potentially create a simple and repeatable model for any creator, community and brand in the ecosystem to put forward amazing artifacts to be minted via Nouns.\n\nThis edition will be minted with [Zora](https://zora.co), and will be available to mint onchain and at [thisisnouns.wtf](https://thisisnouns.wtf)\n\n# Release Details:\n\n**Title:** This is Nouns\n\n**Description:** WTF is Nouns?

Mucho Love will stay as a branch of Nouns Love for further social impact experimentation, public interaction, and testing ground of new ideas in the DR.\n\n**Nouns Love** aims to become a branch of Nouns that focuses on using storytelling, different narratives, and high-quality IRL content creation, which with the **see good, do good** content format **will expand Nouns to a global audience**.\n\nBy the end of the 4-month extension Nouns Love aims to be established as a fully functional platform.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/5j9RvTb.jpg)\n\n### Mucho Love and international communities\nInternational communities will be using the model created by Mucho Love for its activations to test its adaptability. This will allow to take into account the inherent differences between countries, cultures, societal structures that exist throughout the world.\n\n**The communities that will test the model**:  \n◨ Uganda - led by Davin ([https://twitter.com/davinoyesigye](https://twitter.com/davinoyesigye))  \n◨ Mexico - led by Mono & Ale ([https://twitter.com/NounsDAOAmigos](https://twitter.com/NounsDAOAmigos))  \n◨ Germany - led by bk ([https://twitter.com/0xbk_](https://twitter.com/0xbk_))  \n◨ Spain - led by BlakeNeit ([https://twitter.com/blakeneit](https://twitter.com/blakeneit))\n\n**DR activations**:\n-   Knife RD x Mucho Love - “We cooked 100 children’s dream meals” ([https://www.instagram.com/kniferd/](https://www.instagram.com/kniferd/))\n-   Giving an entire community free hair cuts and essentials\n-   @sunsetco.rd x Mucho Love - “We took 10 families to see the beach for the first time” ([https://www.instagram.com/sunsetco.rd/](https://www.instagram.com/sunsetco.rd/))\n-   Techo RD x Mucho Love - [https://rd.techo.org/](https://rd.techo.org/) - Building a house for a family that lost it all to Hurricane Fiona\n-   Hugo Mendoza Children’s Hospital x Mucho Love ([https://hospitalhugomendoza.gob.do/](https://hospitalhugomendoza.gob.do/))\n\n**International activations**:\n-   A refugee dedicated to preserving the endangered Mexican donkey\n-   A volunteering event that will hand out food to homeless people around the city.\n-   A child care center for orphans and abandoned children to donate clothes, nounish educational materials such as books and pencils, toys, and dry stock food hampers.\n-   A city clean-up activation volunteering event.\n\n### Content creation and distribution\n**Every public good, social impact, and charitable effort has a unique narrative**. Through storytelling, all of these narrative can portray what it means to be nounish. Nouns Love will have its own in-house marketing team **to develop unique narratives through captivating, “see good, do good” style videos**.\n\n**The amount of raw content that can be produced from public goods, charitable efforts, social impact is immense**. The marketing team will receive raw content to produce high-quality content for social media distribution. The team will have constant brainstorming sessions with international community leads to deeply understand the particular narratives of every activation done.\n\nContent creation was one of the biggest challenges that Mucho Love faced, not having our own team that could develop our ideas, concepts, and styles was a huge limiting factor on our social media content capacity. **NL’s in-house team will allow us to 5x our content creation capabilities**.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/ZjHKKHM.jpg)\n\n### Development of a flexible framework\nDuring the past 6 months of activations, Mucho Love has made mistakes, created solutions, and changed formats. The amount of time lost by Mucho Love’s starting inefficiencies is very significant. Time-efficiency is the reason why we decided to develop a flexible framework for public goods, charitable efforts, and social impact.\n\n**A flexible framework that allows for better, smoother activations, therefore saving time.** The framework will take into account many minor details that may be overlooked which can lead to a poor activation and overall experience.\n\n**This framework will be tested by our international communities** that will be performing social impact activations during the following 4 months.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/UvXE2KN.png)\n\n### Global synchronous activations\n**A global synchronous activation is an activity performed by many different communities that form the Nounish ecosystem in a certain time period**. These activations will target the same issue/activity and produce raw content for content creation.\n\nBy providing a platform for people to connect and interact in real time, global synchronous activities **can help to build relationships and foster a sense of belonging among members of a community**.\n\n**Nouns Love aims to portray the amazing work being done by nounish communities all around the world**. With storytelling, content creation, narratives, and marketing allowing Nouns to reach a wide audience.\n\nBy removing all barriers of crypto, web3, creating a wallet, discord, different websites, twitter, **see good, do good content** will be able to transcend as far as many hearts it touches in its path. Additionally, global synchronous activities will help build momentum and enthusiasm for a particular cause or issue, driving up engagement and participation within the community.\n\n### Social media & content distribution\n**We aim to expand Nouns Love to**:  \n◨ Youtube: Mid-length video format striving to combine storytelling with good animations, edits, and clips that will lead to the production of family-friendly, shareable, “see good, do good.” content.  \n◨ Tiktok: Short video formats with catchy hooks with the main point of spreading the ⌐◧-◧s through the platform. Making it easier for people who find the ⌐◧-◧s interesting to click the profile and access other social media where more information will be more easily found (Instagram, Youtube).  \n◨ Instagram: So far, Instagram has worked for us pretty well. A few flops and one fantastic post (a post with 67,000 likes), but it’s been great in general. Instagram will be the “face” of what NL stands for, does, and activates. We’ll also be using challenge formats to engage more people.  \n◨ Twitter: We’ll be using Twitter to make updates like “Today, Nouns Love donated 100 football kits powered by ⌐◧-◧”.\n\n**Combining youtube’s storytelling capabilities through mid-length content that engages viewers, TikTok’s short-form video with hooks that captivate the attention to the noggles, and Instagram as the face of NL, we believe that it’ll be only a matter of time & effort for us to reach substantially good levels in all these platforms**.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/a7I8VN1.jpg)\n\n### Budget Breakdown\n\n#### Social Impact Fund 84 ETH\n\n-   5 activations in the Dominican Republic (Mucho Love) (46.5 ETH)\n    -   Transportation, uniforms, volunteers activity, and third parties (6.5 ETH)\n-   4 pilot activations by international communities (16 ETH)\n-   1 synchronous international activation in all 5 countries (15 ETH)\n\n#### Marketing & Content Creation Team 39 ETH\n-   Video Editor\n-   Social Media Manager\n-   Animator/Illustrator\n-   Photographer/Videographer\n\n#### 16 ETH\n-   Retro-funding compensation for 4 core team members who have worked on Mucho Love for the last four months.

Bring the expertise of a Pixar veteran to the Nouns ecosystem enabling us to create a foundational animated short story & proliferate the meme!\n\n\n[Check out the proposal trailer!](https://twitter.com/3D_PrintGuy/status/1604906537184792576)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/V58xsIR.jpg)\n\n**Wait, what is Atrium?**\nAtrium.art is a crypto-native network of independent artists and creators. Disciplines represented on Atrium currently include Screenwriting, Animation, Concept Art, Voice Actors, and Music production. Together, creatives on Atrium bring experience from Pixar, Marvel, Luma Pictures, Sony, Netflix and many more.\n\n> You can see the work of Artists on Atrium [here](https://atrium.art/)\n\nSimply put, Atrium is a way to easily piece together veteran talent to produce cinematic content.\n\n**So … What is this animated Lore?**\nNouns are cc0 identities coming forth one day at a time. While there have been explainer videos done via [113](https://nouns.wtf/vote/113) and open video content proposals (explainers) via [181](https://nouns.wtf/vote/181), We want to create an engaging cinematic introduction to the world of nouns. One that reflects the original intent behind the emergence of Nouns DAO, a story that shows who nouns are, what they have been up to, and a nod to future plans. A tale that leaves the audience curious, engaged, and wanting for more.\n\nWe believe this animation will serve as a foundation to build an expansive storyworld on top of nouns cc0 IP. Where any noun could go beyond the core nouns audience and have a viewership across different communities native to crypto and beyond.\n\n**Who is the creator behind this first story?**\nHaving a creator who understands the NFT space, the broader story, and cinematic culture is important when developing content to serve as a landing page for Nouns. We believe that 3D Print Guy is uniquely equipped in style, storytelling and understanding to provide a memorable rendition of the values and beliefs behind nouns.\n![](https://i.imgur.com/rmzvlQT.jpg)\n\nWith over 2 decades of experience in the business, including working on films like Up, he has been tugging on your heart strings over many years. His youtube page has content eclipsing 45 million views and his characters and plots have shown the ability to capture the world’s attention. He has also demonstrated an ability to release relevant content based on trending topics as seen with his most recent animation about [ChatGPT](https://twitter.com/3D_PrintGuy/status/1600116597711990784) (5k+ likes, 77k+ video views on twitter).\n\nQuick Links about 3D Print Guy -\n\n[Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/c/3DPrintGuyChannel)\n\n[Twitter](https://twitter.com/3D_PrintGuy)\n\nIn 2022 alone he has produced 15 min of animation both in longer formats and short viral clips, with sound design and VFX all done in house. In 2023, we hope to have the opportunity to help proliferate the nouns as well.\n\nSome of the Highlights of 3D Print Guy’s independent work\n\n[Imposter Origins: Among Us](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpCrmbP-Dfs&ab_channel=3DPrintGuy)\n![](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/nouns/optimized/2X/e/eea1fe1b1a05d83b75e4260ea6e9a44c654ae275_2_1264x514.jpeg)\n30+ mil views between Part 1 and Part 2\n\n[Sixstrings: Commissioned Non-canon BAYC Story](https://twitter.com/siixstrings/status/1554875246049722370)\n\n**Process at Atrium**\nThe entire process is a feedback loop. We would be creating a special channel on the Atrium discord server where Nouners are welcome to join and follow along the milestones of the process.\n\nWe would love to have at least one nounder to engage in conversation so that the story stays loosely true to the canon if any.\n\n* The workflow starts with defining the script and dialogs (if any) for the story. This involves defining shot by shot verbatim descriptions of what is happening on screen. A good story is a great script in the first step.\n* After the script is done, we start to look for Voice actors who will help narrate / engage in dialog based on the script. If the script doesn’t have any dialogs and is mostly visually expressive we skip this step.\n* Now the fun part begins where you start to model the characters, the environment, the objects in the scene. Rigging a model is technically intensive process and better rigged models are more equipped for better emotions during a scene (more fluid and organic movements)\n\n![](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/nouns/optimized/2X/e/e4408f0a1790f89fa248ea6aa9d233881580b665_2_522x518.jpeg)\n* Once you have the 3d assets ready - you start the process of Look-Dev. Look development in CG means you start to give definition to the model through textures, lighting, colours etc. They start to come to life.\n* Animatic essentially lets you block out part by part of the story sequence with actual scene setup (the animation is not smooth and done yet but essentially simulates the storyboard).\n* Using the animatic, Sound design can start to happen.\n* We will review the animatic and invite feedback to the animatic via our communication channel.\n* Once the animatic is locked down, the final animation work begins. This is the most intensive and time consuming process and takes the bulk of the later half of the creation cycle.\n* After final animation is done - it is time for last visual effects, lighting passes, refinements before you start to map out the finished sound design artefacts as well as the dialogs.\n* And then the final Reveal of the output (examples shared above). Final Output to premiere both on Twitter as well as youtube.\n\nWe will be utilising the Story’s reach in terms of reshares / likes / social engagement as metrics for success.\n\n**Ask / Cost**\n\nAll inclusive production cost is proposed to be 20 ETH. (Transferred to the Atrium Multi-sig upon execution)\n\nThings covered included\n\n* Storyboarding, Scripting\n* Multiple character plotline (3d Modelling)\n* In 3d animation, cost ramps up as you animate more than one character in a scene + dialog work\n* Voice Over + Sound design\n* Animation\n* Final FX\n\n> We will also be including the main characters 3d files (rigged) available for download and re-use under cc0.\n\n\n**Production Schedule**\nPost the proposal execution, we will look at a final production duration of about 6-8 weeks of the above process.\n\n\nWe will be coordinating the comms and logistics through out the whole process alongside 3dPrintGuy.

This global game is NOT gambling. It’s a peer-to-peer platform where fans challenge each other to test their sports knowledge. It’s where trivia meets March Madness, but for every sport and every Nouner. Nouners will participate against each other in fun, easy, and simple-to-play daily contests across all major sports leagues. Here’s how to play:\n \n### Players join and get a free game credit. \n![](https://i.imgur.com/Je5UNvw.png)\n### Contesting will be available in major global sports leagues, with new leagues being added on demand.\n![](https://i.imgur.com/LuODrnj.png)\n### Players choose a contest of their choice\n![](https://i.imgur.com/99eWvk7.png)\n### Players choose a winner of every game in the contest and earn points for each correct selection\n![](https://i.imgur.com/D3W6oIW.png) \n### The more points they earn the higher the prize\n![](https://i.imgur.com/yxWRgS4.png) \n\n\n# Proliferating The Nouns\nSports is a global passion, integrated within every Web2 and Web3 community. However, the bridge between these two groups has always been a challenge. When it comes to understanding Web3, Web2 users simply don’t know where to start. It’s up to Web3 projects to create resources that are immediately useful to them; Noun Sports Pick’Em™ is designed to do exactly that. This game cultivates an audience of Web2 sports fans in one place by providing a fun, inclusive, daily sports game.\n\nOnce the user has been registered, the game is designed to develop their interest in Web3, specifically the Nouns. In addition to the game’s Nouns branding, there are several key user journeys that will proliferate the Nouns.\n1.\t**NFT Prizes:** Many of the prizes will be NFTs and the dollar values will be shown. When Web2 users see the monetary value tied to the asset, they will be far more inclined to learn about NFTs. ***We will prioritize prizing from the Nouniverse ecosystem***\n2.\t**Nouns Updates:** Users will receive regular updates through e-mail and push notifications about other Nouns projects. There will be a page on the App where they can learn more about these projects.\n3.\t**Daily Facts:** Everyday there will be a brief Noun fact pop-up that users will see when they first open the App. Users can click “Explore Nouns” to be redirected to the Nouns Encyclopedia. \n4.\t**Weekly Voting:** Every week, users can vote on which prize they want the following week. Showing the various NFT utility (many of which will be sports related) will educate users on the Web3 space. On this page, users can click to learn more about the Nouns DAO and voting as well.\n5.\t**Nouns Encyclopedia:** Across the App there will be prompts for users to click “Nouns Encyclopedia” which will be a complete guide to the Nouns. Users will be provided with direct links the Nouns native site\n\n### A subsection of the app titled “Nouns Encyclopedia” will be a resource centre for players to learn about Nouns and NFT’s \n![](https://i.imgur.com/F7D7VjC.png)\n### In app messaging will provide players with interesting facts about the Nouns, Nouns DAO, and NFT’s \n![](https://i.imgur.com/7udQWRo.png)\n### Players will be notified on the app when a new Noun has been minted and provided with a redirect to the Nouns website to bid on future Nouns \n![](https://i.imgur.com/Stky4Ov.png)\n### Bounty will offer NFTs as contest grand prizes, and players will have the ability to vote on which NFT prize they’d like to play for \n![](https://i.imgur.com/ApqbmiW.png)\n\n\n# Our Team & Purpose:\n\nWe are Bounty Sports; a passionate group of sports fans who have worked tirelessly over the last two years to build Bounty.

Diversity in strategy ensures the diversity of the audience and maximum reach of the Nouns community. The marketing budget was determined so that Noun Sports Pick’Em™ can acquire 10,000 users in its first year and reach a total audience of over 57,000,000 sports fans globally. The campaigns will also include several Web3 influencers, events, and channels to acquire sports fans within the Web3 community as well. Marketing strategies include the following:\n\n1.\t**Influencers** (YouTube & Twitch)  - We will work with a vast network of YouTube / Twitch streamers (primarily e-sports and sporting news content creators) to promote Nouns Sports Pick’Em™ and migrate their audiences to the platform\n2.\t**Paid Media** – We will run targeted interactive media ads via ad publishing networks\n3.\t**Podcasts** – We will partner and become a staple on various sports centric and NFT-focused podcasts to grow the Nouns Sports Pick’Em™ brand reach and total impressions\n4.\t**Referral/Organic** – We will develop a robust referral program, where Nouners and new players can refer their networks to earn game credits, prizes, tickets, and more\n5.\t **Conferences & Events** – We will be an active participant at various NFT and Sports conferences alike, to deliver on the ground promotion of Nouns Sports Pick’Em™\n\n\n# **Monetization & Project Longevity**\n\nNouns Sports Pick’Em™ generates revenue by taking a 10% rake on paid contests, which allows the game to operate in perpetuity. Revenue generated will fund prizing and marketing in Year 2, and beyond. All excess funds will be used towards purchasing Nouns and other relevant sports NFTs, which will be layered in as additional prizes within the game. Bounty Sports is also committed to sponsoring other Nouners’ projects to grow our own game and re-invest in the Noun community. \n\n\n\n# **FAQ About Proposal**\n\n**Q:** Is this sports betting?\n**A:** No! This game format is considered a “game of skill”. There is no “house”, and all contests are run as peer-to-peer competitions. In essence, it’s a form of sports trivia. \n\n**Q:** Will Nouns Sports Pick’Em™ have e-sports?\n**A:** Absolutely. E-sports will be significant focus for Nouns Sports Pick’Em™, understanding it’s one of the shared bridges between Web2 and Web3 communities.\n\n**Q:** Is this a free-to-play (FTP) or pay-to-play (P2P) game?\n**A:** Both. To be inclusive and ensure everyone can play, the F2P game will be available globally. We will also offer a P2P game for users that want to compete with their own currency to win cash prizes. \n\n**Q:** How is the game monetized?\n**A:** The F2P game is not monetized, it’s FREE! The P2P game takes a 10% commission on the prize pool. For example: 100 users @ Ξ 0.10 = Ξ 9.00 prize pool + Ξ 1.00 commission to Nouns Sports Pick’Em™. The commissions will go towards funding future F2P prizes and marketing, so the game will run in perpetuity!\n\n\n**Q:** Will the game accept crypto deposits & withdrawals?\n**A:** Of course!\n\n\n**Q:** Is this a Web2 game or a Web3 game?\n**A:** This is a Web2 game. You don’t need a Noun or any other NFT to sign-up and play. The objective is to capture a widescale Web2 sports audience, as well as sports fans in Web3, and educate them on the Nouns.\n\n**Q:** How do you build the Nouns name among Web2 users?\n**A:** The Nouns Sports Pick’Em™ will be marketed to a Web2 audience through traditional marketing channels. Once on the platform, user engagement will be optimized to educate users. The game will leverage, giveaways, gamification, and regular communication to bring attention to the Nouns community.\n\n**Q:** Will Bounty integrate its existing audience into the Noun Sports Pick’Em™?\n**A:** Yes! Bounty has 20,000 active players. Through the F2P game, they’ll have opportunities to win prizes, and be directed to the Nouns ecosystem. \n\n**Q:** What will Luke Rockhold’s involvement be on this project?\n**A:** Bounty has unlimited worldwide use of Luke’s name, image, and likeness. We will leave it to the Nouns community to decide if, when, and how they’d like to leverage this resource within the project.

Danit will introduce them to Nouns and tell them about the opportunity to build on top of the protocol.  \n\t* The collection's exhibition area is going to be a custom built interactive experience. It will include an AR installation and holograms representing the collection & Nouns.\n* **Showcase the collection in future events, museums, and galleries. Use this collection to introduce Nouns to new audiences.**\n\t* Danit will make the collection available to show in future events where Nouns have presence (like NFT NYC, NFT Aus, ETH Bogota/SF etc.)\n\t* Danit will (and has already started) introduce Nouns at her lectures in various events, e.g. at a recent workshop for executives at a very large luxury multinational corp.\n* **Who is Danit**?\n\t* Danit is one of the world's leading experts & innovators in 3D-printed clothes and textiles.\n\t* Her [TED talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/danit_peleg_forget_shopping_soon_you_ll_download_your_new_clothes) received more than 2M views. \n\t* Danit's past work has been in the [Opening Ceremony of the 2016 Rio Paralympics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFEBaJWzER8), Triannale di Milano, Maker Faire, The National Center for Craft & Design, The Franklin Institute, Landesmuseum Württemberg Stuttgart.. and many more\n*  **This prop is for the last milestones of the Nouns 3D-printed collection.

Not unlike Nouns, it's at the intersection of art, culture & tech. \n*  The tech being so new, and the visuals so striking, 3D-printed clothes and textiles get a lot of attention. The collection is eye-catching and different. It can be used to attract attention at various events. \n*  Fashion executives, especially in the innovation departments of big brands, are always on the lookout for the next thing. Through this collection nouns will stand out and help future potential brands learn about the opportunity to build on this open-source brand!\n* It's also just very nounish: pushing the boundaries of fashion in an authentic way.\n---\n\n### What does this proposal include?\n\n* Finish modeling and printing 5 looks.\n* Attending NFT Paris with a custom-built exhibition space, in a magnificent historic location, the Grand Palais.\n\n### Why combine finalizing the collection with the NFT Paris event? \n* Since it's physical, I want the collection to get exposure and eyeballs IRL. This event has the perfect audience and location.

From weekly shows with the NFL and top Twitch Streamers, to multi-million dollar Esports events such as the (Emmy Nominated) Dota 2  Animajor, we pride ourselves on making the most memorable and exciting events in Esports. \n\nNow, it's time for Nouns to have one of their very own: THE NOUNSVITATIONAL! \n\n## Please watch our short VIDEO PROPOSAL BELOW! \n\n\n\n[![https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pet9rHvlNs](https://i.imgur.com/IQh4GII.png) ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nhwg_nlX-w)\n\n---\n\n \n Short and sweet: we believe that an Esports event can take Nouns to new heights. We don't want to just show people some Noggles and call it a day - We want to enact a 3 step mass integration program designed around introducing (and integrating) the esports public at large into Web3, Nouns communities, and furthering the Nouns mission.  \n \n \n \n### Introduction \n \n We first learned about Nouns after your fantastic Dota 2 team entered the scene, and we got to know a few of the amazing folks over at the Nouns Esports crew. After doing our research on Nouns, we were impressed to find a group of people who were different from the normal Dota 2 Esports sponsors. In a scene plagued by Betting Companies, Scam Coins, and other nefarious evil-doers, it was refreshing to find a group of people using Crypto in a positive way; One that we would be proud to partner with to spread their message. Weplay prides itself on being the best in our industry and working with the best in their industry, and we believe that this project would be one of those partnerships. \n \n![](https://i.imgur.com/wb1Bub0.jpg)\n\n \n ### What we Offer\n \n What Nouns Proposals have been doing so far is great, but we believe we can do so much more for the growth of Nouns in the eyes of the general public. Many of your successfully executed Proposals in the past have focused on getting the brand of Nouns out there with general advertising methods of simply \"showing the brand\". What we offer is not only brand recognition, but brand integration, on a wide and universal scale. \n \nWe don't just want people to know what Noggles are. We want people to know about the Nouns mission, the point of a DAO, and to get people who have never heard of Crypto or NFT's (even people who actively dislike them) to see the Web3 world in a positive light by having them actively participate in a system designed around an event that we know they want to watch. \n \n![](https://i.imgur.com/Ay6mRjf.jpg)\n\n \n  ### The 3 Step Plan \n  \n  Our idea is simple: get viewers to come for the Dota, and stay for the Nouns.  ⌐◨-◨\n  \n1. ENTERTAIN\n\nCreating a custom, interesting Dota Tournament structure with a dual purpose of getting as many viewers as possible to watch due to its innovative nature, world class teams, and Dota's best Talent while also subtly introducing them to a DAO structure in a positive way.\n\n2. EDUCATE\n\nOnce they come for the world class Dota, educate them about Nouns with direct, custom created content which Nouns can use forever (Nouns explainers, DAO explainers, Web3 explainers, and even mini-docs about past successful proposals and interviews) which we will play in-between the games to show that Nouns are one of the good guys, and that this system is something they can be a part of\n\n3. INTEGRATE\n\nUsing a POAP system, and focusing on a \"Mini Dota DAO\" designed around people who have no idea what Web3 is or don't even have crypto wallets, we aim to make the \"scary world of crypto\" something that viewers actively participate in both rewarding and fun as they collect Dota 2 themed POAPs during the event. By utilizing in-game systems, viewers can even trade these POAPs for digital cosmetics in Dota 2, giving them real value to the average viewer. \n\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/MgG6sMz.gif)\n\n\n  ### The Event\n\n\nThe Nounsvitational will be a world class five-day Dota 2 Tournament featuring ten of the top teams worldwide with the best broadcast talent in the Dota scene held from February 14th to February 18th. This will be a Tier 1 Dota 2 event, and the first LAN in DotA since the International World Championships in October. This will be the long-awaited return of Weplay to the Dota 2 scene (voted best Tournament Organizer in the scene, even surpassing Valve, the game's creator itself), and the first non-traditional Custom Game Mode LAN in several years. Suffice it to say, this event is going to be EXTREMELY hype for the average Dota viewer.\n\nUsing our custom map makers, we will transform the Dota 2 in-game map to be a Nounish playground, full of memes, references, and general Nouns branding so that millions of viewers will see Nouns during the games themselves. Between the games, we will utilize our content creation skills to produce and air custom Nouns video content, which will educate the viewers on Noun's culture, structure, mission, and past projects. \n\nHeld in the Weplay Studio in Los Angeles, we will bring the best teams around the world to play, and invite as many Nouners and Nounsfolk as we can to be part of the audience, for a once in a lifetime exclusive and intimate experience. \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/jO0BL0g.jpg)\n\n\n### Integrating the General Public to Web3\n\nThe event itself will get people's attention: they will watch for the unique structure and for the world class competition. But our true goal will be to get the viewers to understand and integrate into the Nouns culture while they watch a fantastic event. \n\nOur plan for this is also 3 fold. \n\n1. Traditional Pre-Event marketing of Giveaways, pushing people to join the Nouns Esports Discord, follow the Nouns Social media, and even give away tickets to attend the event live. Combined with the content we create at the event, we will ensure that people WANT to watch the content we provide, so they can understand the \"scary world of crypto\"\n2. Contacting the best artists and creators in Dota to make custom Dota 2 POAP art, which we will give away to viewers who watch the event. This will not only drive up viewership, but with an integrated system where viewers can trade POAPs for in game cosmetic items, chances to win prizes, and other benefits, we will not only subtly introduce the average viewer to the world of NFTs, we will ensure that they have fun doing it and can trade them for real value. \n3. Creating a \"Mini Dota DAO'' prior to the event, which will not only advertise the event during its duration on Reddit and other platforms, but show the general viewers that not all NFT and Web3 projects are \"bad guys\" and that the Nouns protocol is something that is actually cool, using a real tangible example that makes the Dota 2 community a better place. \n\nWe believe that by letting the viewers not just watch the Event, but actively participate in the event with POAP collecting, exchanging, and voting for how to \"better the world of Dota\" with a Nounish DAO system will achieve the greater purpose of the event. Come for the Dota, Stay for the Nouns.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/DigBHGf.gif)\n\n### How does this Proposal Benefit Nouns? \n\n* All video content created for the event (the explanatory videos, documentary-like series, etc.) and the content from The Nounsvitational itself will be usable by the Nouns community as both \"proof of concepts\" and general media Nouns will be able to use forever. This media, especially explainer videos on what are Nouns, Web3, and DAOs, have great value for future proposal endeavors.  \n* Fantastic way to showcase current and past Nouns projects to first-time viewers in a captive audience. Can use already created media from other successful Proposals and expand on them with interviews from the people that made them happen\n* HUGE viewership and outreach to a variety of new, interested viewers in the world of Esports (a community that has a lot of crossover with Web3 already) in a positive, productive way in a scene that views other projects very negatively \n* Cements the Nouns brand in a very valuable space with tangible, easy to gather data showcasing sign ups, viewers, and active participants for future project proposals\n* Active (and trackable) onboarding of the general public to Web3 ideas and systems in a fun and dynamic way where they feel rewarded and positive about their experience, which is one of Noun's core goals   \n* Growing Nouns communities by incentivizing viewers to join for access to prizes, events, and other incentives along with getting them onboard with the general Nouns ecosystem\n* Come to LA! Nouns holders as well as Nouns community members can come and be part of the audience for the event, meet the players and the Talent, and have the experience of a lifetime! A great reward for your already amazing community members! \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/RNEH3Tt.png) ![](https://i.imgur.com/WmBYAjm.png)\n\n### Ask and Budget Breakdown\n\nTotal Budget: 799 ETH (at $1200) $958,800\n\nCategorized Breakdown:\n- Prizepool - 166 ETH / ~$200,000\n- Flights, Accommodation, Food for Teams: 171 ETH / $205,200\n- Mini Dota DAO Seeding - 10 ETH / $12,000\n- Customization of Dota 2 Map, In-Game integrations - 40 ETH / $48,000\n- Talent Fees - 55 ETH / $66,000\n- POAP Integrations - 7 ETH / $8400\n- VIP Experience for winning Nouners 10 ETH / $12,000\n- Complete Event Fulfillment (Production, Graphics Design, Stage, Venue, Content, Staffing, Security) - 340 ETH / $408000\n\nFunds would be received by a multi-sig (3/4) and then delivered to Weplay.\n- Brennen (Nouner)\n- Sasquatch (Nounsfolk)\n- Maty (Nounsfolk)\n- Kyle (Weplay Operator)\n\n### Event Timeline\n\nMedia Day: Feb 13\nGroup Stage: Feb 14-Feb 15\nPlayoffs: Feb 16-Feb 18\n\n### About Us\n\nWe are Kyle and Slacks, two prominent Dota 2 talent who also work at Weplay.

We truly believe that this event will not only be incredible for Nouns, but also be a fantastic and unforgettable experience for the people in the Nouns community that join us live, virtually, and the Dota 2 community at large. We hope you will consider our proposal and would love to have any comments, feedback, and suggestions. We want to build this event for you, but also build it WITH you, to make sure we make it as NOUNISH AS POSSIBLE! \n\nThank you\n\nSlacks and Kyle\nWeplay Esports\n\n---\n\n## ADDITIONAL INFO\nStill looking for some more, condensed information? Then please continue reading!\n\n\n### On Dota 2 \n\nCurrently, Dota 2 is the 2nd most played game on Steam, the biggest gaming platform in the world. It reaches a global audience with millions of active players each day, and even more viewers on it's Esports events. \n\nCurrently, Dota 2 is experiencing a resurgence of the most viewers and players since 2013! \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/ayuGSsx.png)\n\nWhile most Triple A games and Esports require multi-million dollar fee to enter into the sphere with licensing fees and IP protection, Valve allows anyone to do anything with their games, giving full mod tools to players. This allows us to create a very Nounish event for a game with one of the highest viewership numbers in all of Esports. This event would only be possible in Dota, and Dota is our specialty here at Weplay. \n\nIn terms of reach and scale of viewers, the numbers are hard to come by as China and Russia have viewership data that is not easily accessible, but viewership of top events (such as The International and the Weplay Animajor) can reach into the millions from the English audience alone. \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/NI7SdaC.png)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/ViAaXH3.png)\n\nFor a full breakdown of the Viewership of Weplay's last event, please [check out this link](https://escharts.com/news/weplay-animajor-stats) \n\n### On the \"Mini Dota DAO\"\n\nWe know the mission of Nouns is to gather together and pool resources to make the world a better place. But, the concept of a DAO and the betterment of society that can be caused their-in is something completely foreign to most people. To help the viewers understand (and subtly advertise the event) we propose creating a \"Mini DAO,\" a system that is modeled after Nouns itself! \n\nThe process is simple. At the start of the event, we announce that we will take a percentage of the prize pool and allocate that money to \"make Dota 2 better.\" Then, we will start a Reddit thread (Dota 2's primary community hub) where people are able to offer suggested Proposals for how to spend that money to make Dota better. During the duration of the tourney we will actively check in on this thread, promote it, and encourage people to add to the charitable donation if they wish for some in-game perks like having messages appear during the game on the in-game map. At the end of the event, we will have a vote and choose which idea the community suggested to allocate funds to and announce the winner. \n\nThe point of this is for the community to be HEAVILY INVESTED in the tournament and the suggestions in the Mini DAO, but more importantly by the end of this promotion they will VERY CLEARLY understand the Nouns structure and mission, without being simply told how it works.

I don’t doubt that it is warranted for a quality event, but I think there are better ways the DAO could use the money. In particular, I am more interested in going deeper with our true fans than trying to reach out to a community that has historically disdained NFTs/crypto (the Dota subreddit responses to this proposal were not encouraging). I also felt a bit like the proposal was made to work for the proposers in a way that maybe doesn’t make the most sense for Nouns: the emphasis on using the proposer’s venue and the VIP Nouns experience. Finally, there were a lot of ideas here about how to use NFTs in the contest itself, but the proposers by their own admission seem to have little experience in the space. I think there’s a lot of subtlety here and it would take some real experience to get it right. Hope to see these proposers back with other ideas in the future! \n"},{"support":0,"voter":"0x44b1b486Ce8d9C82f605626347a7B1F74ADD11DE","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x65B5e05CcD26C87A19B455B18309aF687c6E7473","numberOfVotes":0,"reason":""},{"support":0,"voter":"0x1D3bc1F9D3f9770453949aBd619592CD7583c5Ed","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":0,"voter":"0xa8d04Cd4e1951291740Ef977d56336fDC7f394c5","numberOfVotes":5,"reason":""},{"support":0,"voter":"0x583885492B1aC55e6633CDd89d03939033C96bf8","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0xa903C06BF35286f6d1cDAD25396748353979a44C","numberOfVotes":2,"reason":"While this is a large ask, I think there is huge value in this proposal.\nAt this point in time, it doesn't look like it will be successful unfortunately, but decided to show my support nonetheless.\nMaybe this would be more successful when eth prices are higher, who knows?"},{"support":2,"voter":"0xE26D78c6bFF297Bbc2dA3f80FEA9a42028a4260F","numberOfVotes":3,"reason":""},{"support":0,"voter":"0x75Ee6eb3d8DAcf41eE2e5307090B197D3E1Cca6E","numberOfVotes":22,"reason":"thoughtful proposal but given it's considerable cost i am not convinced the dao will get the bang for our buck required to justify such a large outlay"},{"support":1,"voter":"0xDEAD753f9B1eb8F2f7372E8587e7C6e342daac89","numberOfVotes":2,"reason":""},{"support":0,"voter":"0x83fCFe8Ba2FEce9578F0BbaFeD4Ebf5E915045B9","numberOfVotes":16,"reason":"voting against because the bet size is too large relative to the culture fit. am generally supportive of ambitious proposers with large distribution channels but they have to be a better fit with nouns culture and aesthetic. thank you to the proposers and the nouns esports group"},{"support":1,"voter":"0x19Cc9d48f2032f3EC8d6f60EA84979169A848231","numberOfVotes":2,"reason":""},{"support":0,"voter":"0x8AE80e0B44205904bE18869240c2eC62D2342785","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":0,"voter":"0x13eEf4EF8FCa471f242ab0F8F49A3dB6017aDA33","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":2,"voter":"0xA1c0b11B86A46885B87c7ed68b91FAa0C349e1cD","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""}]},{"prop":{"id":199,"description":"# Distribute (some) Nouns Vision Glasses to Nouns holders (randomly)\n\nProp and code written by [DigitalOil.nftr](http://twitter.com/0xDigitalOil) with **❤️** for *Nouns DAO ⌐◨-◨*\nSpecial thanks to [solimander](https://twitter.com/_solimander_) for taking a look at the custom contract.  \n\n\n##Intro\n\n[Prop 57](https://nouns.wtf/vote/57) funded the creation of 8,250 pairs of luxury sunglasses made by [Nouns Vision](https://nounsvision.com/). Approximately 560 of those have been sold to individuals.*\n\n[Prop 185](https://nouns.wtf/vote/185), executed recently, assigned 150/500 Nouns Vision Glasses (GLASSES) held in the Nouns DAO Treasury to 3 different groups in the Nouns ecosystem.\n\nThe aim of this prop is to distribute 50 of the remaining 350 unassigned GLASSES to Nouners. Each GLASSES is an NFT redeemable for an individual pair of physical glasses.\n\nA custom made site @ [nounsclaims.wtf](http://nounsclaims.wtf) and contract were developed for this prop.  \n\n\n\n# Proposal\n\nOver 550 Nouns have been minted. Given that only 350 GLASSES in the Nouns Treasury have not been earmarked, there aren’t enough GLASSES to assign one to each Noun. Assuming that there were at most 350 Nouners, GLASSES could be distributed 1:1 per Nouner, but such distribution wouldn’t be fair as some Nouners own a disproportionate number of Nouns and thus higher weight in control of assets in the Treasury.\n\nIn addition, it wouldn’t be wise to liquidate all GLASSES in the Treasury, as we might find another good use for them in the future.\n\nHence, this proposal allocates 50 GLASSES to be randomly assigned (with pro-rata probability) and claimable by wallets that hold Nouns at time of distribution. The contract was designed to allow for the creation of multiple claim rounds in order to protect against GLASSES staying unclaimed forever. The claim window was set to 15 days (108,000 blocks). After 15 days have passed, Nouns DAO can pass another prop to compensate for GLASSES that went unclaimed and distribute them randomly again, and even distribute additional GLASSES if desired.\n\n\n![Custom site deployed for this prop at nounsclaims.wtf](https://i.ibb.co/0CVKCGB/Screenshot-2022-12-30-at-1-08-03-PM.png)\n*Custom site deployed for this prop at nounsclaims.wtf*\n\n\n# Technical Details\n\nTo ensure the fairest distribution possible and to make it impossible to game the system, the source of randomness for the distribution algorithm comes from Chainlink’s Verifiable Random Function ([VRF](https://chain.link/vrf)) service. \n\nThe [Nouns DAO Executor](https://etherscan.io/address/0x0BC3807Ec262cB779b38D65b38158acC3bfedE10) contract was set as the owner of the deployed custom contract, so the distribution trigger can only be pulled by Nouns DAO.\n\nThis is the high level flow:\n\nVoting —> Prop passes —> Prop executes (**) —> Function in NounsVisionVRFDistributor called\n\n—> Chainlink VRF random number requested \n\n—> VRF Coordinator calls back GLASSES distribution function in NounsVisionVRFDistributor\n\n—> Glasses are assigned to wallets that hold Nouns at that moment\n\n—> Noun-holding wallets can claim GLASSES won by the wallet for 15 days\n\n\n# Conclusion\n\nIn addition to serving as a fun distribution mechanism for GLASSES in the treasury, this prop serves as a proof of concept for how other NFTs in the Treasury could be distributed if need-be in the future. \n\nIf this prop is well received and the DAO would like to distribute more than 50 additional GLASSES, I’ll submit a new prop leveraging a more gas-optimized contract that can handle bigger allotments.\n\nAlthough I own 2 Nouns, given that I am not a guaranteed beneficiary of this prop, I will be voting in favor instead of abstaining because I’m interested in seeing the experiment play out.\n\nLet the **🎲** begin.\n\n\n(*) Total number of mints is ~1800; this includes 500 for Nouns DAO, 500 presumably reserved for the special edition disco noggles, and 250 for the team.*\n\n(**) This prop also makes use of the custom contract deployed for Prop 185 (NounsVisionBatchTransfer), made by [9999](https://twitter.com/lastpunk9999). Nouns DAO grants the NounsVisionVRFDistributor contract (custom contract for this prop) an allowance of 50 GLASSES on the NounsVisionBatchTransfer contract.","proposer":"0xAEC4075e4fc8cE829BC4f0cFD5e2fA10dd2b12D1","startBlock":16333528,"endBlock":16369528,"executed":true},"votes":[{"support":1,"voter":"0xAEC4075e4fc8cE829BC4f0cFD5e2fA10dd2b12D1","numberOfVotes":2,"reason":"I checked the numbers and checked again,\nit's was for real, my lottery win!\nDid a jig and whooped and cheered,\nnearly deafened everyone's ears.\n\nMy Mother's spirit gave those numbers to me,\nthem in a dream I did truly see;\nshe'd always said that she would do it,\na promise I just knew that she'd stick to it.\n\nMom played lotteries her whole life,\nwith numbers and challenges, her days were rife!\nWhen I started playing, she'd promised me,\nif not her she help me win the lottery.\n\nFor years the numbers did fill my dreams,\nMom's spirit tried to fulfill her promise it seemed;\nI'd play that lottery religiously,\nknowing one day, rich I'd be.\n\nOh how excited I was to see,\nthe numbers 18, 24, 36, 47, 69, 33.\nThen my eyes veered to the ticket date;\nwhat a letdown, I'd bought it a day too late!"},{"support":1,"voter":"0x5606B493c51316A9e65c9b2A00BbF7Ff92515A3E","numberOfVotes":25,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x4754b7e3DEde42D71d6c92978f25F306176EC7e9","numberOfVotes":9,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x3993996B09949BBA655d98C02c87EA6ABf553630","numberOfVotes":2,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0xeffec2D0163343c8F26983Af1f6684e0b966a6b2","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x70eCe45cDc64A768f936Ccb8aC851578251363e3","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0xe703f231aB056eCb99C92a1232cC1020ACFC72f8","numberOfVotes":2,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0xA387c87102fc0B51939d0CF9A86F7edd05291D5c","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x8dA24B480689314C6d217F2D0Bad0DacCC87ff44","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0xb4496906D6EA2685E7A46A14BAEfae9fe3bF0D2f","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0xF9C298545dA80df7767C4e5a9296a071F13702B8","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x2767eDfee9f5ba743511Ee4187A596B302B43938","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x3B502B054715A8e0D8F657169615A88B2CCDD429","numberOfVotes":2,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x81EAca3EB49d3aff173eFd1A8eAEFf5e1dea00d6","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0xa8d04Cd4e1951291740Ef977d56336fDC7f394c5","numberOfVotes":5,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x1D3bc1F9D3f9770453949aBd619592CD7583c5Ed","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x583885492B1aC55e6633CDd89d03939033C96bf8","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0xa903C06BF35286f6d1cDAD25396748353979a44C","numberOfVotes":2,"reason":"Another interesting distro model for some of the Nouns Vision glasses currently sitting in the treasury.\n⌐◨-◨ "},{"support":1,"voter":"0xeb13fdDFA9B2A4a6E4e7B2D67b6E38C208C41249","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":"yup"},{"support":1,"voter":"0x008c84421dA5527F462886cEc43D2717B686A7e4","numberOfVotes":28,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x8BecD7EbF3F910090f9264DFD0Bb221Ea04af8c3","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":0,"voter":"0xA86882277E69FbF0a51805cdc8b0a3a113079E63","numberOfVotes":2,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x75Ee6eb3d8DAcf41eE2e5307090B197D3E1Cca6E","numberOfVotes":22,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0xC3FdAdbAe46798CD8762185A09C5b672A7aA36Bb","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0xDEAD753f9B1eb8F2f7372E8587e7C6e342daac89","numberOfVotes":2,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x83fCFe8Ba2FEce9578F0BbaFeD4Ebf5E915045B9","numberOfVotes":16,"reason":"really fun idea. thank you to the proposers"},{"support":1,"voter":"0xaafCA6E684dBCA42D8846d64ABd1d28AEe8207f3","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":"On behalf of the Party Noun https://www.partybid.app/party/0xaafca6e684dbca42d8846d64abd1d28aee8207f3"},{"support":1,"voter":"0xcC2688350d29623E2A0844Cc8885F9050F0f6Ed5","numberOfVotes":11,"reason":"**Nouncil Vote:**\n\n51 Yes, 2 No, 2 Abstain\n\n8 Nouncillors abstained from the decision\n\n**YES WINS**\n\n---\n\n**Vote Reasons & Discussion**\n\n---\n\n**lilpizza.eth** | *\"This looks like a fun initiative!\"*\n\n**Satori** | *\"Easy yes in my opinion.

Putting aside the fact that all Nouners can afford to buy these glasses, and there is plenty of supply still available, handing out any of these glasses to Noun holders is possibly the lowest leverage opportunity for their distribution. Prop 185 was a much more thoughtful approach and I assume it will be much more impactful.

Of course we should give some of these glasses, entrusted to the DAO, to Nouners. But some valid concerns have been raised: Does this set a bad precedent of the DAO giving free stuff to Nouners? Using DAO holdings to reward Nouners? Should we be more focus on spreading the meme beyond the DAO? Can we avoid a distribution that favors those who hold several Nouns? \n\nI am sympathetic these concerns and appreciate those who have raised them, but I am still for this proposal. Proposal 57, which funded the creation of 8,250 of these glasses, included an allotment of 500 glasses to NounsDAO itself. I consider 50—10%—to be a fairly modest portion of this allotment. I think giving them to DAO members is a fun use and a very reasonable way to “spread the meme:” I think we should have some faith that the Nouners who receive these will do interesting things with them! \n\n150 have already been given elsewhere and after this 300 will remain. I hope those who want to see these go outside the DAO will put up proposals to make this happen. Let’s use them! In my opinion, there is no reason to be precious.  \n"},{"support":1,"voter":"0x8D1011626268BD26CB82f00C2089e356D36a1000","numberOfVotes":0,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0xA1c0b11B86A46885B87c7ed68b91FAa0C349e1cD","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x62E66C82A9E3221AC84496d796b17d941986F385","numberOfVotes":0,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0xE73F9c181B571Cac2bf3173634d04a9921b7fFcf","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":"Seems reasonable, but would like to see other proposals to distribute glasses to other folks!"},{"support":1,"voter":"0x2Ef9834de85F62F36FE39cb3387D30469762AD1b","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":0,"voter":"0xCB43078C32423F5348Cab5885911C3B5faE217F9","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":"if proliferation is our goal here, we should send these to people and organizations with large audiences and high-visibility instead of (mostly) anonymous nouners."},{"support":1,"voter":"0x0B3CF56E7dF3BB3Fb7201fFcD96d279b05DDd2E3","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":"⌐◨-◨ "},{"support":1,"voter":"0x19Cc9d48f2032f3EC8d6f60EA84979169A848231","numberOfVotes":2,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x8AE80e0B44205904bE18869240c2eC62D2342785","numberOfVotes":2,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x36A5Bc205DF1ED65C86301022cfc343a6ce546ff","numberOfVotes":2,"reason":""}]}]

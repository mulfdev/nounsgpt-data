[{"prop":{"id":250,"description":"# Noun Nyms\n\n# Proposal: Noun Nyms\n\n__special thanks to [Noun 40](https://twitter.com/noun40__) for delegating us a noun to make this proposal__\n\n## Background\n\nPersonae Labs is exploring the future of pseudonymity in Ethereum.\n\nWe launched heyanoun.xyz (prop 150) as an early experiment in allowing private truths to surface. \n\nWhile we fundamentally believe that there's value in allowing controversial opinions to surface, we think heyanoun is far from healthy pseudonymity's final form:\n1. it's impossible to engage with a heyanoun opinion pseudonymously\n2. it's hard to filter spam/toxicity from actually useful discourse\n3. users have no way to accrue 'reputation' to their pseudonymous selves\n\nWith this in mind, we're entering our next phase of iteration and we want to launch zk-powered pseudonyms and discussions for nouners. \n\nThis will be the first implementation of our [simple persistent pseudonym](https://ethresear.ch/t/a-simple-persistent-pseudonym-scheme/14930) scheme. \n\nThese both represent relatively ideas in zk-app development and represent a pretty large leap forward from existing capabilities. When we sat down to think about which internet community to pilot them for, the answer was obvious: Nouns.\n\nWe hope that through this work, we'll continue iterating on healthy discussions in the future internet together.\n\n## Primary deliverables\n\nWe'll deliver a hacker news/reddit-style website with two primary features for nouners (verified by ZKP as with heyanoun v1):\n1. persistent pseudonyms\n2. threaded pseudonymous discussions\n\n### threaded discussions\n\nHeyanoun v1 messages can't be replied to or held accountable. While we often see situations in which users broadcast a message effectively replying to a previously posted message, threading isn't explicit.\n\nIn v2, we plan to make it possible to reply to an arbitrary previous message, thus enabling arbitrary discussion trees to form. \n\nWe believe that this is crucial for re-engagement.\n\nWe'll build on the second idea briefly mentioned [here](https://ethresear.ch/t/a-simple-persistent-pseudonym-scheme/14930#extensions-10) to do so. \n\nAs mentioned earlier, we're designing a hacker news/reddit-style interface for creating new discussion points and commenting on old ones.\n\n### persistent pseudonyms\n\nHeyanoun v1 had no sense of persistence in user identity. Users post messages into the ether.\n\nWe believe that with some notion of persistent pseudonyms, we can enable more interesting pseudonymous conversations between nouners. Persistent pseudonyms also allow for simple mechanisms of reputation and content filtering.\n\nIt becomes possible, for example, to filter discussion to just those discussions involving a well-known pseudonym.\n\nAdditionally, nouners will be able to bring their pseudonyms anywhere on the internet; only a specific nouner can generate the proof corresponding to a specific pseudonym. \n\nAlthough we won't be designing for this initially, this portability means that these pseudonyms can be re-used in other internet venues, similar to an ENS name. \n\n### (rough) user flow\n\nWe imagine the following user flow (designs pending):\n- user generates proof of nouner-ship\n- user picks pseudonym to attach to message\n    - any pseudonym they've used before or a new one\n- user picks message in-thread to reply to\n\nIn this way, nouners add pseudonymous messages with pseudonyms attached to one big nounish, pseudonymous discussion tree.\n\n## Secondary deliverables\n\n### downstream consumption by API\n\nAs mentioned above, the resulting 'data artifact' produced is a tree of proofs, pseudonyms, and messages. \n\nWhile today, the main consumption methods for heyanoun messages are twitter/discord bots, we want to open the API such that any nounish downstream site can pull relevant heyanoun messages into their site. \n\n### integration with spartan-ecdsa and further proving improvements\n\nIn parallel with our work on heyanoun, we've been working at [improving our technical capabilities](https://twitter.com/personae_labs/status/1621575568109223936?s=20).\n\nWith heyanoun v2, we'll upgrade our proving stack to the latest and greatest, which will result in considerably faster (<10s in most cases) proving times.\n\n## Timeline and ask\n\nWe come to the DAO presenting an outcome we believe we can drive towards: zk-pseudonyms available to every nouner and a platform for those pseudonyms to have threaded conversation.\n\n**Our ask to the DAO is $160k in helping us reach this outcome.**\n\nAs it's quite a hefty amount of new technology, we expect this to take ~6months for a team of 3-4 devs.\n\nRestated from above, the deliverables:\n- a new hacker news/reddit-style website, built around\n  - pseudonym selection\n  - zk-gated discussion threading\n- APIs for downstream consumption of conversation\n- integration with the best of our proving stack\n\nAs always, our code will be open sourced and made available for extension and re-use.

In this world, we would have no need for rules or principles. But in our world, voting is a reality. So we have a simple rule: we only vote against. We use a “Squad Vote” for each proposal. If more people vote against than vote for or abstain, we vote against on-chain. Otherwise, we abstain. This is our rule.\n\nAccording to the “squad vote” result for proposal 251, which is 0 for, 18 against and 4 abstain, we choose to vote against.The viewpoints of our different members are as follows (source not listed):\n\nOpinions opposing this proposal:\n1. The finances for marketing proposals should be tightened. It is recommended that all marketing proposals go through the Small Grant channel. If they want to go through the on-chain major proposal channel, they must prove that there can be revenue and feedback to the treasury. The key indicator for evaluating a marketing proposal is whether or not it has a meme or story. The idea behind this proposal is obvious and lacks any story or meme.\n2. Based on my current experience, I have observed that Nouns attract new community members and grow primarily through outstanding community products, the hard work of dedicated teams, the tireless promotion of Nouns by holders, and prop house rounds that demonstrate Noun's vigorous vitality of the community. However, Proposal 251 has created a Consumerism landscape that is not conducive to marketing and brand building within the community.Personally, I have no interest in marketing without incorporating memes or stories. Proposal 251 will not capture the recognition of both fashion circles and Crypto-Native partners, and instead make them feel like there is another naive buyer paying for trendy things while satisfying some people's self-perceived pleasure in effective marketing.\n3. Data shows that Proposal 197 had poor execution results after implementation with only one thousand views on Twitter review proposals with sixteen retweets compared to an investment of $120k resulting in low ROI.\n\nOpinions supporting this proposal:\n1. 3D printed fashion looks good and novel.\n2. Danit Peleg (the proposer) has successfully delivered three rounds of proposals in the past. She is dedicated and can enhance the Nouns community. As an Israeli fashion designer, she became famous as the first designer to create 3D-printed clothing."},{"support":1,"voter":"0x696ed7b26f4B019CEeC78DC8b9140ad64A6f354B","numberOfVotes":9,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0xbc3ed6B537f2980e66f396Fe14210A56ba3f72C4","numberOfVotes":3,"reason":"I'm really happy with how Prop 197 went, and think it makes sense to do this follow on, as well.

Not sure if it makes sense to ask the DAO to vote on going to each event, and we may see diminishing marginal returns. \n\nThanks for all your work and good luck in NYC!

Staying true to the Nouns style, the drop will be released via a daily auction, with 100% proceeds from the auctions going back to the NounsDAO treasury.\n![](https://i.imgur.com/QnTnl7I.png)\nNFJ lies at the intersection of Nouns, non-fungible tokens (NFT), and fine jewellery. Using NFT to deliver this physical collection, it represents our shared enthusiasm towards this phenomenon where culture and technology converge.\n\nThe NFJ project is a strategic collaboration between three brands:\n1. **Nouns**, with its extensive network and NFT presence\n2. **State Property**, a fine jewellery label known for their contemporary designs, whose distribution network spreads globally, and the choice of many reknown celebrities\n4. **HeyMint**, smart contract and technical experts who have centered their mission around making Web3 accessible to everyone\n\nThrough this collaboration, we hope to achieve the following:\n- Proliferate the brands of all three partners\n- Introduce Nouns and fine jewellery to NFT collectors; introduce blockchain technology and NFTs to traditional fine jewellery audience\n- Develop an exclusive line of fine jewellery that is worth collecting, and for full auction proceeds to go back to the Nouns treasury\n- Create sustainable utility, where Nouns holders can tap onto HeyMint's Smart Contract Launchpad to launch their own NFT collections \n\n---\n# Fine Jewellery, NFT, and Nouns\nFine jewellery is a specific class of jewellery that uses precious metals and gemstones, and is known for their exquisite craftsmanship. Because of their exceptional quality and high value, fine jewellery pieces are often passed down as family heirloom.\n\nThe emergence of NFTs has opened up many possibilities. With Nouns, a self-governing organisation that begets organic brand building has emerged. With fine jewellery, NFT presents a means to collect and authenticate fine jewellery with ease.\n\nNFJ celebrates Nouns by incorporating Nounish elements everywhere. Designing around Nounish elements instead of a specific Noun gives the jewellery pieces broad appeal, and when collectors discover their backstory, it becomes extra meaningful. Our goal is to start with an exclusive first collection, with potential for wider releases as awareness and demand grow.\n\n---\n# **The NFJ Project**\n\n**The NFJ Project comprises of a few key deliverables:**\n1. Design and crafting of the 1/1 physical jewellery pieces\n2. NFJ exhibition\n3. Media event and online proliferation\n4. Daily timed-auctions\n5. Redemption for physical jewellery with NFT\n6. Post-event activations\n\n**1: Design And Crafting**\nThe NFJ collection embodies the vibrancy of the Noun characters. Taking cue from iconic Noun traits, the collection is an artistic expression of meme culture and Nouns culture while retaining the quintessential luxe of fine jewellery.\n\nAll our physical jewellery will be made in 18-Karat gold and will contain gemstones ranging from white diamonds, coloured diamonds, sapphires, rubies, and tsavorites. Specific specifications as shown below: \n![](https://i.imgur.com/zqkYDBl.jpg)\n\nThere are a total of nine designs, each of which are bespoke and one-of-a-kind. This is similar to the concept of 1/1 NFTs where there is only ever one of that piece and its provenance is cemented on the blockchain.\n\nThe technical drawings above showcase State Property's creative vision and their artistry in adopting Nounish aesthetics. In giving this luxury spin to Nouns, State Property has designed for these pieces to appeal to the luxury fine jewellery audience that they are very familiar with, and are aware of clients who will be eager to get their hands on them. \n\nUpon passing of the proposal and successive funding, the designs will be turned into 3D, moulded, and then crafted. Thereafter, we'll do a photoshoot of the physical pieces. \n\n**2: Jewellery Exhibition**\nThe launch of NFJ kicks off with a fortnight-long exhibition for these nine jewellery pieces, hosted at State Property's Atelier. There will be daily online features during the campaign period on [NounsinSG Twitter](https://twitter.com/nounsinsg) and  State Property's [socials](https://instagram.com/thisisstateproperty), sharing the backstory and inspiration behind the collection and the designs. \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/97Aw6WO.jpg)\n*Outside view of State Property Atelier's main showroom – decorated with Noggles.*\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/eITF36S.jpg)\n*Display showcase updated in Noggles and the collection theme.*\n\nLocated in the civic district of Singapore, the State Property showroom at [Armenian Street](https://www.nac.gov.sg/resources/engagements-with-the-sector/45-armenian-street) is the perfect venue for the exhibition and event. The area has been designated as an arts space and often draws in huge crowds during seasonal events. Utilising State Property's space is strategic and would also lower the ask of the proposal.\n\nBased on our expected timeline, we plan for the exhibition to coincide with [Token2049](https://www.asia.token2049.com/) (13–14 September 2023) and [F1 Singapore](https://www.gpmotorsportstickets.com/formula-1/singapore-grand-prix-tickets/) (15–17 September 2023). While Token2049 attracts a Web3 audience, F1 draws in tourists from around the world. \n\nState Property's central location and proximity to these events makes it really easy for interested visitors to hop over to check out the exhibition during the week. Our goal is to maximise attendance and reach of the exhibition, which will grow the attention and demand for the auction. Thereafter, the media event will happen the week after the F1 weekend so as to deconflict from the packed schedule of international visitors.\n\n**3: Media Event And Online Proliferation**\nThe key highlight of the exhibition will be the media night. This will be held on the second week of the exhibition.\n\n> **Expected Event Dates**\nExhibition: 11 Sep, Monday – 24 Sep, Sunday\nMedia Night: 22 Sep, Friday\nDaily Auctions: 25 Sep, Monday – 3 Oct, Tuesday\n\nWe'll be inviting the local media and influencers to cover the event. The NFJ collection will also be featured in [Tatler Asia](https://www.tatlerasia.com/) magazine *(Luxury media brand in Asia with over 3M monthly online visitors)*, and will be covered by jewellery reviewer, [Katerina Perez](https://katerinaperez.com/) (*Jewellery insider with over 13 years experience and over 400K Followers on Instagram*).\n\nWe will also extend invitations to various NFT communities as well as State Property's clientele. And on the event day, we will have a Nouns booth by @NounsinSG to share more about Nouns, and also a [NFT Workshop](https://www.wereearly.xyz/resources/intro-to-nft) hosted by @Han (Beetle) to introduce NFTs to the non-Web3 fine jewellery audience.\n![](https://i.imgur.com/bb09JvH.png)\n\n**4. Daily Timed-Auctions**\nAt the end of the exhibition and event, we will kickstart the online auction for the 1/1 Jewellery NFTs in Nouns-style i.e. one NFT per day. Each time an auction is settled, the settlement transaction will also cause the next NFT to be released and a new 24H auction to begin. **Full proceeds from the auctions will go to the Nouns treasury.**\n\nWinners of the auction will be able to receive the corresponding 1/1 Jewellery. This is done through a redemption process on the website, and they will receive the physical jewellery at no additional cost.\n\n**5.Redemption For Physical Jewellery With NFT**\nWhen all the daily auctions conclude, the website will be updated with a Redemption Page. Jewellery NFT owners will be able to redeem for the physical jewellery. \n\nThe redemption process requires NFT owners to enter their personal particulars and delivery details, and a confirmation email will be sent before the delivery is dispatched. During the process, NFT owners need to allow the website to read the wallet for the NFT and sign an on-chain transaction to update the NFT. \n\nOnce redeemed, the NFT will be updated with a 'Redeemed' status. Buyers and owners of a 'Redeemed' NFT will not be able to redeem for the physical jewellery. Redemption of the physical jewellery is optional. \n\n**6.Post-Event Activations**\nNFJ is more than a one-time activation. We want to ensure continuity with whatever we've been funded to build, which includes releasing a second collection and giving access to a NFT launchpad.\n\n**I: The Noggle Collection**\nYou might notice that none of the designs in the first collection incorporated the Noggle. This was intentional so that the designs can have broad appeal while being Nounish. As fine jewellery is often an article that initiates conversation, we also want people to ask, \"What about the Noggles?\"\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/RuOIK35.png)\n\nThis brings us to the second collection, which will be released as demand scales up. These will be customisable and also redeemable for their physical counterparts. \n\n**II: Build With HeyMint**\n[HeyMint](https://heymint.xyz) has developed two tools – an allowlist manager, and a no-code NFT creator tool, HeyMint. While the basic smart contract launchpad is free to use, premium features like Staking, Burning, Soulbinding, Refunds, and Snapshots, are token-gated to partnered communities. With the NFJ collaboration, HeyMint will grant Nouns holders premium access, which means that builders within the Nouns ecosystem will get permanent access to these creator tools.\n\n---\n\n# **Who We Are**\n[**State Property**](https://thisisstateproperty.com)\nEstablished since 2015, State Property is a fine jewellery label whose minimalistic and modern designs have been worn by Michelle Obama, Nicole Kidman, Taylor Swift, and many other celebrities. Their jewellery have also been featured in magazines including Vogue, Tatler, Cosmopolitan, and WWD. Based in Singapore, their distribution network stretches across the Middle East, EU, UK, and US (including [Net-A-Porter](https://www.net-a-porter.com/en-us/shop/designer/state-property)).\n![](https://i.imgur.com/DROOkEg.jpg)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/KqyfR5Z.jpg)\n\nState Property's collections are often inspired by nature, architecture, and even the stars, and they have a knack to imbue storytelling into their designs. For example, they have a collection (*[Voyager](https://thisisstateproperty.com/collections/the-voyager)*) with pieces named after famous adventurers, while another collection (*[Unfold](https://thisisstateproperty.com/collections/unfold)*) reimagines the classic pearl in contemporary settings. \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/jkxtzOX.png)\n\nState Property's clientele are typically working professionals or high net worth individuals who can afford to spend on fine jewellery. They are attracted to State Property's unique and contemporary designs that can be worn casually or for more formal occasions.\n![](https://i.imgur.com/SMvpaAk.jpg)\nEdgy designs, celebrity fanfare, and established distribution aside, State Property is uniquely positioned to step into the NFT scene. With their design-centric background and artistic interest, founders Ruiyin and Afzal recognises the advent of NFT as another platform for creative expression, just like jewellery. Their readiness to experiment and embrace new innovations also positions them to onboard the largely traditional industry and non-Web3 collectors into the space. \n\n**[HeyMint](https://heymint.xyz)**\nA team of creatives and developers who aims to build the best free tools available so as to help make Web3 mainstream. HeyMint are experienced technical builders and has helped major brands in the NFT space with their drops, including Zen Academy, World Of Women Galaxy, Kingship, and The Littles. Founders Mai Akiyoshi and Ben Yu are software engineers at heart and have grown their passion into a technical team who build tools for the Web3 economy.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/PapVaWA.png)\n\nWith NFJ, HeyMint are the right fit as technical partners as they envision a similar future shaped by Web3 builders. NFJ is just the start that adds a single Auction function onto their Launchpad. Opening up their Launchpad to the many builders within the Nouns ecosystem also puts them in the best position to tap onto these creative minds, while they focus on being the technical experts. The potential projects that will come out of this collaboration is endless and will certainly contribute to the exponential growth and adoption of Web3 and NFTs.\n\n**Han [(Beetle)](https://twitter.com/beetleswt)**\nThe one who ties it all together. Han is an active community lead in CloneX Singapore; he regularly coordinates local meet-ups and collaborates with other global CloneX community leads to spearhead initiatives for the community.\n![](https://i.imgur.com/SalAzSa.jpg)\nHan believes that the future of brand building is NFTs and brands will build in a ground-up manner alongside their communities. He runs regular NFT workshops for small groups and for corporates to introduce them to the concept of cryptocurrencies and NFTs. The workshops include a hands-on NFT minting session that uses Nouns Playground to create the visuals and leads to a discussion on DAOs. *See [presentation materials](https://www.wereearly.xyz/resources/intro-to-nft).* \n\nOver the past three years, Han has worked closely with State Property with their digital marketing efforts. He was also one of the early evangelists with the HeyMint team. In bringing together all the contributing partners, Han will also be the main project lead coordinating on the physical jewellery and technical end, while working alongside Karl to engage with the NFT communities.\n\n**[Karl](https://twitter.com/WideEyeKarl) (@Nounsinsg)**\nKarl is a Nouns evangelist who spearheaded [@Nounsinsg](https://twitter.com/nounsinsg), a proliferation pod focused on raising Nouns Presence in Singapore. His fascination with the organic growth of Nouns has led him to onboard many traditional brands, builders, and NFT collectors into Nouns.\n\nIt was through the [Nounish Beach Clean Up](https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/small-grants-nounish-beach-clean-up/1653/15?u=wideeyekarl) when Karl and Han met, which led to the current NFJ proposal, where high-level creatives like State Property are onboarded. His enthusiasm is highly infectious and his Nounish contribution inspired many other builders in the NFT space.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/hP0qGd0.png)\n\nKarl's main role in this project will be as a strategic advisor and gatekeeper to ensure the project stays aligned with the Nouns ethos. He'll also be working alongside Han to engage other NFT communities, and will be the Nouns ambassador running the Nouns booth during the exhibition and media event.\n\n---\n\n# Funds Break Down\n\n\n**1.

This is our rule.\n\nAccording to the “squad vote” result for proposal 253, which is 6 for, 10 against and 11 abstain, we choose to vote abstain.The viewpoints of our different members are as follows (source not listed):\n\nOpinions opposing this proposal:\n1. The theme of Hack Week is not clear, and the proposal is a bit rough.\n2. Time. The poster indicates that it will be held from 3.27-4.2, which is very urgent. 70% of the effect of Hack Week comes from early preparation and BD, especially as an online hackathon, the promotion and BD time in the early stage needs to be longer.\n3. 99 ETH expenditure is too high. It's unreasonable to hastily organize a Nouns ecosystem Hack Week for about $200,000.\n\nSupporting views on the proposal:\n1. A replicable growth model has been proven in the Nouns ecosystem. From Open Round and private voting research rounds, this is the best Nouns growth model. And every launch will attract enough attention and increase community cohesion. This proposal belongs to repeating an already successful model to promote ecological growth for Nouns with no logical problems.\n2. The difference in this proposal is that Hack Week will involve more operational work than Prop House rounds without promotion or operation; this replicable model can actually be optimized by Proposal 253 for mature growth within Nouns' ecosystem.\n3. Behind Proposal 253 are teams such as Nouns.build, Nouns Square, Grant Protocol etc., who together form a golden team among all proposals related to nouns - they are trustworthy due to their understanding of noun spirits as well as professionalism and execution capabilities.\n4. On another note: I am concerned that overly professional requirements for proposals may stifle community atmosphere. Many proposers have no problem with logic or implementation but may get bogged down in how professional their proposals should be instead of focusing on what's best for nouns."},{"support":1,"voter":"0x696ed7b26f4B019CEeC78DC8b9140ad64A6f354B","numberOfVotes":9,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x2767eDfee9f5ba743511Ee4187A596B302B43938","numberOfVotes":3,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0xb4496906D6EA2685E7A46A14BAEfae9fe3bF0D2f","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x0055CD5F017027D10ADF4f13332181e6D8D886BB","numberOfVotes":2,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0xb5A497ce6B9843E5936B9da985174c0906520387","numberOfVotes":3,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x93D94557824AC07A30b5B0f44f7CB3E00f9c4191","numberOfVotes":2,"reason":"This is our prop, so we are naturally in support of it.

The plan is to rebrand a venue currently owned by 87Bones ([Noun 552](https://nouns.wtf/noun/552)) in Melbourne, Australia, turning it ‘Nounish’. With this we will create an open franchisable package with the intention of scale. The team is already highly respected in the industry with experience across the breadth of the field. As the venue is already a profitable business, we believe this would be a low-risk opportunity for Nouns to enter the IRL space. After initial funding this site will be totally self-sustainable.\n\nThe shop redesign will be largely cosmetic.  A benefit of recreating an already established venue is that most of the infrastructure and industrial equipment has already been purchased.\n\nInstead, the funding will be spent on ‘Nounifying’ the deli and adding custom fixtures to proliferate the brand. The new design will feature screens displaying the nouns daily auctions amongst other Nounish content. We will install large display shelves allowing the sale of a custom merch and a consumable range. Alongside the Nouns deli branded merch and consumable, this space could be an additional platform for previous and future successful Nouns proposals to sell their products on consignment.\n\nOur goal is to build the Nouns Deli brand into a scalable business, opening up opportunities to expand around the world. Sticking to the Nouns CC0 philosophy, our vision is to build a fee-less franchise model; we intend to make everything open source, available to all. As this is rare in the hospitality industry, we expect it to gain a lot of attention, and with it the potential for even more brand proliferation. [Goldy](https://twitter.com/Goldypix) (Nounish, Goat Club) & Jarmen ([Noun 332](https://nouns.wtf/noun/332)) will be jumping on the team in Noun advisory roles to focus on public relations/education & content.\n\nThe Deli / The Team **⌐◧-◧**\n----------------------------\n\nStan’s Deli is a local community hotspot, positioned off one of Melbourne’s most popular boutique shopping strips comprising over 400 retail shops. The area is central to some of Melbourne’s most affluent suburbs. Stan’s is known for its coffee and sandwiches, consistently being voted in the top 5 sandwich venues in Melbourne. The deli has been operating as a profitable business for 3 years with a further 3x3x3 left on the lease. The owners are three experts in the hospitality and retail industry, who between them operate 10 retail spaces, 3 beverage brands and over 40 years combined experience in the industry.\n\nThis teams owns some of Melbourne’s most iconic venues and have a strong track record: Chef hats (Australia’s Michelin Star), ongoing listings in critics top foodie destinations, best fitout awards and a non-alcoholic beverage brand selling over 1.2 million serves across 8 countries and a VC funding deal of AUD $13m.  \nThe team’s expertise spreads across all aspects of the business, from food and beverage development, day to day business logistics to brand creation and marketing. Between them, they know the ins and outs of creating a successful business.\n\n![](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/nouns/original/2X/5/5624277e125605b77f0d060c6e66d8bf9224abd1.gif)\n\n[See full video here](http://stansdeli.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/REVIEWS-REVIEWS-REVIEWS-REVIEWS-REVIEWS-REVIEWS-REVIEWS-REVIEWS-REVIEWS-REVIEWS-REVIEWS-REVIEWS-2.mp4)\n\n**Flipping it Nounish ⌐◧-◧**\n----------------------------\n\nTo make the venue truly Nounish, Stan’s Deli will need a full cosmetic facelift. The essential commercial equipment will remain, but significant changes to the design of the deli are needed to highlight the Noun brand. Our goal is to create a timeless sandwich shop model, incorporating the Nounish pixel art-focused design that can easily be replicated in different locations worldwide. Along with this timeless and replicable design, we want to incorporate custom neon Noggles and exterior murals designed by local artists to make each franchise unique to its location.\n\nDriving home the Nouns brand, we want to add a modern twist, installing screens to display the Nouns daily auctions & other Nounish content on rotation. While customers grab a bite, they can engage and learn more about the DAO.\n\n![](https://i.postimg.cc/6QwWSfFk/stansdeliinside-1.jpgg)\n\n**CC0 ⌐◧-◧**\n------------\n\nWith a CC0 culture, the new Nouns Deli will change the narrative in the hospitality industry. Currently, it all happens behind closed doors; the secret herbs and spices, special burger sauces. Heck, coke has its recipe in a bank vault that only two people can access at a time. We want to spread the Nouns CC0 philosophy and make everything open source through our CC0 library; recipes, package designs and branding assets will all be made available on our website. The wave of interest and attention the CC0 model will create in this industry will give us the perfect platform to share these core Nouns values.\n\n**The Model ⌐◧-◧**\n------------------\n\nThe team is proposing a franchisable model for scaling when ready. Adhering to the Nouns philosophy, there will be no fee associated with this franchise model. To ensure the brand is held to a high standard, those wishing to be officially affiliated with Nouns Deli will have to undertake a compulsory screening process. Once the original Nouns Deli is established, our team will provide consulting and mentoring services to approved franchisees. The goal is for scalability, the ability to replicate across the world.\n\n![](https://i.postimg.cc/Xv8j0ybp/a28d36944e9a917b2c2d81a5e45d81b0.jpg)\n\n**The App ⌐◧-◧ -**\n------------------\n\n![](https://i.postimg.cc/hjZKXWhn/NOUN-LOYALTY-APP.jpg)\n\nA custom app will be developed as an easily accessible platform for the Noun’s Deli community and will extend to include any additional franchises. The app will reward regular customers through a loyalty program model, allowing them to earn points towards benefits or discounts with each purchase; a modern day coffee loyalty card. Customers will stay engaged through the use of push notifications, delivering exclusive offers such as happy hours discounts and CTA rewards. These push notifications can also be an opportunity to circulate engaging creative content and Nounish news. The CC0 library will also be made available on the app, alongside cooking videos and other educational tools. Our mobile app will encourage return clientele, creating an experience that extends the reach beyond the physical brick and mortar offerings, drawing them back to further engage with Nouns.\n\n**Proliferation/touch points ⌐◧-◧**\n-----------------------------------\n\nThe potential for proliferation with a franchise model grows with every expansion. The team has a presence in the local hospitality industry and strong existing relationships with three core media agencies in Melbourne—Broadsheet, UrbanList, and Concrete Playground—which have a combined reach of 6.4 million. The team will use these connections to gain feature articles and free marketing. Our paid marketing strategies will focus on two areas: online viability using large platforms such as Twitter to reach current untapped audiences, and physical presence focusing on capturing the already large NFT culture within Melbourne. This would include poster runs, pop-up NFT events, and catering to NFT/Web3 conferences. To ensure the Nounish culture of giving is also proliferated, we hope to give out free Nouns ‘Deli Burgers’ wrapped in noggles paper to underprivileged communities. We want to highlight the incredible impact this DAO has had and will continue to have, essentially sharing the story.\n\nOur vision for the first permanent Nouns IRL store is bigger than just a sandwich shop with Noggles painted on; we want to create an approachable educational tool for the DAO. QR codes on coffee cups, enabling us to direct daily traffic selected content, such as the ‘This is Nouns’ video highlighting content from other successful props. Currently averaging around 100,000 coffee sales each year, this is just one easily executed proliferation tool.\n\nAs we are entering uncharted territory for the DAO we believe transparency with data collection from these marketing tools and activations is useful information for the community and future proposers. All analytics gathered will be made available on our website.\n\n![](https://i.postimg.cc/C15gTP7Q/ezgif-5-e168849c16.gif)\n\nThe Sauce ⌐◧-◧\n==============\n\nAn avenue we believe has huge potential is a “Nouns Deli Sauce” range. We want to create a packaged consumable range that will be featured throughout our in-store menu. Launching the range will be the “Nouns Hot Sauce”. Our dear friend, Mathew Garthweight, owner of [Mats Hot Shop](https://matshotshop.com/en-us)—Australia’s leading boutique hot sauce distributor—will collaborate with Nouns Deli to produce our very own “Nouns Hot Sauce”. The products will be available to ship worldwide, allowing consumers to recreate Nouns Deli sandwiches at home. Matt has previously created his own range of hot sauces with huge success, winning multiple international competitions. Upon release, one hot sauce will be made claimable for each Noun holder. Other sauces we intend to roll out into the range are “Nouns Burger Sauce” and “Nouns Dipping Ranch”, but the possibilities are endless and can be rolled out according to consumer demand.\n\nBuilding out our new menu, we plan to feature a ‘Deli Burger’ as a nod to Noun 552 owned by 87Bones. This burger will be served in branded sleeves, and is sure to be one of the most recognizable items on the menu. Furthermore, the Deli Burger will be the item served at all of our pop-up events. Additionally, we will invite guest chefs to collaborate and create menu items inspired by other Nouns.\n\n![](https://i.postimg.cc/hhWWmSBk/ezgif-3-71fedd840b.gif)\n\n**Retail/Merch ⌐◧-◧**\n---------------------\n\nStan’s Deli has been highly successful with its merchandise in the past, so we intend to release some branded Nouns Deli merchandise. The first drop will feature Nouns Deli t-shirts, hoodies, coffee mugs, a tote bag, and our consumable range.\n\nFurthermore, we would like to use our space to create a platform for previous and future successful Nouns proposals to sell their products on consignment, thus providing another platform for the success of Nouns products.\n\n**ROI ⌐◧-◧**\n------------\n\nThis is not merely a “flash-in-the-pan” proposition; instead, the intention is to promote long-term proliferation of Nouns. The store will serve as a “permanent” educational billboard for the DAO, enabling it to capture public attention and provide information and content through multiple touchpoints. This will create a scalable IP for public benefit. Moreover, the store will be an opportunity to grow the community, share resources and knowledge regarding the DAO. Having already established itself as a popular foodie destination, and with a team committed to providing great hospitality supplemented with education, Nouns Deli is set to be a success.\n\n**The Risk ⌐◧-◧**\n-----------------\n\nWhy would we close a profitable business? \"As a recently minted Noun holder, I’m committed to the Nouns brand and believe it can become widely recognised in the near future. The Nouns model aligns with my morals and values and I want to use my resources and skill set to proliferate this incredible brand.” - 87Bones.\n\n**Additional Factors ⌐◧-◧**\n---------------------------\n\nThe rebranding fit-out will cause some time of closure and loss of revenue, we predict around 2 months until Nouns Deli can open its doors to the public. Having built a strong team over the past three years, we would like to hold on to the core members through this time. We intend to utilise this time to educate our team on all things Nouns, by reopening, our team will be able to guide our guests through the nouns ecosystem with ease.\n\nOther costs that will continue during the closure are rent, insurance, utilities and other creditors.\n\nThe Budget ⌐◧-◧\n---------------\n\n![](https://i.postimg.cc/9Q2z527g/NOUNS-BUDGET.jpg)\n\nPayment Schedule ⌐◧-◧\n---------------------\n\nWe are proposing a three-milestone payment schedule for funds from the multi-sig. The first payment will be used to commence the designs for the Deli, develop the website and app, and obtain the necessary permits for the site. The second payment will be made on the date of Stan’s Deli’s closure and allocated towards the shop fit-out. The third and final payment will be made on the day of Nouns Deli’s opening and designated towards the marketing and PR budget.\n\n1.  $83,043\n    \n2.  $104,518\n    \n3.  $15,200\n    \n\nMultisig Wallet Signers (3/5): eth: [0xa5E73b7B1a2422edb1824A1BDfDb8dD9E2c22Be8](https://etherscan.io/address/0xa5E73b7B1a2422edb1824A1BDfDb8dD9E2c22Be8)\n\n87Bones, Jarmen, Maty, Digital Oil, Goldy","proposer":"0x008c84421dA5527F462886cEc43D2717B686A7e4","startBlock":16878401,"endBlock":16914401,"executed":true},"votes":[{"support":1,"voter":"0x008c84421dA5527F462886cEc43D2717B686A7e4","numberOfVotes":38,"reason":"I have been talking to the team for a couple months; this is an important experiment for Nouns. My goal is to find ways for it to pay for restaurants to rebrand as Nounish.\n\nMy bigger picture goal for it is to extend how we even think about the Nouns brand and how it spreads. How to make this into a repeatable Open Franchise kit, with the Nouns cc0 meme, open to all, such that any independent restauranter can plug into it and use aspects of it as they see fit (or not, open means use what works or nothing at all), and each one that plugs in enhances the entire network and its reach and relevance, a decentralized cc0 branded franchise. There are other elements to this stack that can be added by smart builders if they see an opportunity from loyalty/marketing/retention/rewards program/Web3 Point of Sale UX are all natural fits and some will be made in this Proposal but this model and kit will be open and evolve and incorporate what works and drop what doesn't over time.\n\nDone well this Open Franchise Model mutually reinforces Nouns and whichever restaurants plug into it.  It could empower independent retail food service and create many proliferation opportunities that shoot off in a bunch of directions from customers to existing restaurants to people who are engaged by disruptive never before tried models.  This experiment has the potential to blaze this trail.  It will be on the team, who bring a track record running similar restaurants and businesses and who own Nouns and are committed to Nouns and are going out on a limb, to make this happen and create a model Nouns franchise.  This Proposal and the Nouns seed relationship and halo is what give it the chance to grow.\n\nAs to protections for the DAO, the cost side is what it costs to take this risk, we went back and forth on it.  Nothing seems out of whack or inflated, they are making disruptive changes to an existing business and its physical plant to effect this change. There are milestones in place from within the multisig controlled by Nouners so there's also controls if it runs into an insurmountable challenge and has to stop.

The proposal emphasizes business model innovation, but using a points program to maintain user loyalty without any community ownership does not reflect innovative business models. Existing Web3 consumer explorations have shown that even if the community has a little bit of ownership, the effect will be very different.\n2. The biggest concern is sustainability. Some long-standing old stores root themselves in the community and condense rich social relationships. However, operators in this proposal rely more on Nouns12 to maintain it. If people who have been in restaurants for a long time do not see or understand information about Nouns belonging to the community, then the relationship between such restaurants and Nouns is very fragile over time. In other words, if operators of the Nouns brand do not love their community, its actual effect on Nouns' culture and brand will be minimal.\n3. I asked about restaurant ownership issues with Nouns12, and they replied that there was no connection between restaurant ownership and Nouns; it only had promotional effects on branding. From this perspective, it's not cost-effective.\n4. We are unfamiliar with Australia's commercial environment and concerned about instability in offline space operations - such as local restaurant closure rates or whether it's possible to spend $200k decorating an establishment only for it to become unprofitable after one year.\n\nSupporting views on the proposal:\n1. I've always had special feelings towards physical spaces offline. Buildings are not just functional venues but also condensed things within meaning worlds that remain unchanged. Building a square in a community where social interactions occur frequently - like children playing around or lovers being intimate - remains constant while producing many interesting stories above them; layered cultures emerge from these buildings over time.Building architecture is unique because promoting culture is difficult yet when an offline entity exists long enough; interesting stories continue emerging from them creating multi-layered cultures.\n2. Despite having several problems highlighted by opposing views regarding short-term benefits versus costs involved with this proposal, it's worth exploring and seeking Co-Create's consultation and assistance. This proposal takes an important step in Nouns' exploration of Web3+ consumption + offline community building, even if the concept may not be perfect."},{"support":1,"voter":"0x696ed7b26f4B019CEeC78DC8b9140ad64A6f354B","numberOfVotes":9,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0xbc3ed6B537f2980e66f396Fe14210A56ba3f72C4","numberOfVotes":3,"reason":"Wild, fun experiment for a pretty low ask, relative to the work to be done.

At Poolsuite, we’re a small team of passionate builders with a desire to create beautiful internet products, and we’re keen to understand the appetite within the Nouns community to collaborate. While we don’t yet have a treasury that enables us to focus our primary efforts on public goods, we can bring our deep understanding of consumer products and expertise in crafting rich brand worlds to the Nouns ecosystem. In the same way we have begun collaborating with major designer brands (alpha soon) we want to do the same within web3, and we see Nouns as one the most actively engaged and innovative communities in the space, uniquely positioned for us to work with on wonderfully designed products that push forward web3 adoption alongside the combined awareness of our brands.\n\n**INTRODUCING NOUNS WALLET SERVICE**\n\n---\n\nNouns Wallet Service would allow any user to add **any NFT** (or ERC-20) into their Apple/Android wallet — the same place they keep their loyalty cards, boarding passes, and credit cards — unlocking the ability for web3 communities to send push notifications to token holders and a wealth of powerful future use cases. This tool would be usable by any Ethereum based DAO/NFT collection. \n\n![Screenshot 2023-01-09 at 10.20.37 PM.png](https://i.postimg.cc/XJ8yckxs/Screenshot-2023-01-09-at-10-20-37-PM.png)\n\n**Why?**\n\n- In the mainstream view, NFTs are still mostly seen as investment assets but placing NFTs side by side with loyalty cards and boarding passes tangibly demonstrates that they offer much more and can unlock a variety of experiences. To bring the next wave of mainstream users to web3, we need tools that make the web3 experience as friendly as web2.\n- There's an engagement problem in web3; its incredibly hard to communicate with token holders. We've seen this first hand fighting our way to the top of the Twitter feed to notify our [Executive Members](https://members.poolsuite.net/) of new drops. A lot of communities are building their own apps to try to solve this engagement challenge but not every project needs an app.\n- The shutdown of the Nouns Discord opened the door for reimagining what the communication and social layers can look like for decentralized communities. Nouns communications are currently fragmented. And while there are various [chat groups](https://nouns.center/groups), [newsletters](https://nouns.substack.com/), and Twitter accounts, there is no simple real-time communication layer that is gaining significant traction.\n\n****************************Considerations****************************\n\n- Nouns Wallet Service would be a free tool, available to every web3 community.\n- Every new community that uses the tool would proliferate the noggles and their association with building public web3 infrastructure. Nouns Wallet Service would launch as “Nouns Wallet Service public infrastructure by Nouns DAO”, similar to [Prop House](https://prop.house/), [Nouns Builder](https://nouns.build/), [Voters.wtf](https://www.voters.wtf/nouns).\n- Unlike with mobile apps, push notifications are enabled by default with wallet passes, meaning no additional opt-in is required.\n- Last year we built an early version of Wallet Service for our Executive Members that generated a ton of excitement within our community, and we’re confident we can develop this into a fully-packaged service that works incredibly well for both centralized and decentralized communities.\n- We’ve passed Lil Nouns prop lot with 687 upvotes (9% consensus) – s/o Lil Nouns community for feedback, helping us shape up this proposal, and for putting this proposal onchain.\n\n**Funding Request**\n\nWe’re asking for 120 ETH to design and build Nouns Wallet Service including 1 year of maintenance from our team. To bring the next wave of mainstream users to web3, we need tools that make the web3 experience as friendly as web2 – and we believe these tools should be built as public infrastructure, freely available for all DAOs. The funding would go towards:\n\n- **Web App** – Designing & building a beautiful interactive web app where users will be able to connect wallet and select which NFTs to add to their mobile wallet (on desktop: scan QR, on mobile: download natively). We’ll design this interface alongside the Nouns community to reach an exceptional execution of the Nouns brand.\n- **Token Integration** – Building upon our rudimentary alpha version to integrate with any Ethereum token based community (ERC-721, 1155, and 20)\n- **Custom Push Notifications** – Creating a customizable push notification system where Nouners (and other Nounish DAO members) will be able to choose frequency (live, daily, weekly) and type of notifications from a selection of onchain events (new proposal submitted, funded, voting open, capital deployed, prop house voting open, etc.).\n- **Admin Panel** – Creating an admin panel for teams to manage & send custom push notifications & update the text & links on the back of the passes.\n- **Pass Designs** – Automating the design process of wallet passes based on any NFT visual assets. For Nouns and lil Nouns we’ll design custom passes which we’ll share with the community for approval. For other communities, we’ll automatically assign a color scheme based on the NFT imagery (unique for each NFT).\n\n********************************Potential future use cases********************************\n\n- Token gating IRL with a QR scanner: Wallet Service would allow for a very simple 1 NFT = 1 Event Ticket gating system.\n- Integrating new sources of notifications for Nouns/Nounish DAOs such as Prop House events, votes from key delegates (Nouncil voted “For” Proposal 367), 3rd party sources to select from (ex. Discord), etc.\n- Ability to customize pass fields to include points/token balance(s), contributor status, awards, and to allow users to add their name to the card or select their own colors.","proposer":"0xDCb4117e3A00632efCaC3C169E0B23959f555E5e","startBlock":16882798,"endBlock":16918798,"executed":false},"votes":[{"support":0,"voter":"0x5606B493c51316A9e65c9b2A00BbF7Ff92515A3E","numberOfVotes":20,"reason":""},{"support":0,"voter":"0x4754b7e3DEde42D71d6c92978f25F306176EC7e9","numberOfVotes":7,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x8ac3ecf6973E020cC0E6e8989Fb71B4a77D65987","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":"Reasons given in my newsletter: https://paragraph.xyz/@thebower/active-governance-noun-582-4"},{"support":0,"voter":"0x8dA24B480689314C6d217F2D0Bad0DacCC87ff44","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x70eCe45cDc64A768f936Ccb8aC851578251363e3","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":"This sounds super useful and is a great public good for the ecosystem.

The proposal for NounsWallet is different from Prop House and House Of Nouns' building products from scratch for Nouns. The product was not adopted in FWB, and now they are applying for funding in Nouns to do integration, which is extremely unreasonable. Nouns provides both users and funds to integrate a product service.\n3. There is insufficient confidence in timely delivery of the product. This is PoolSuite team's first proposal at Noun. In the past, the team has delayed delivery of products such as https://grandleisure.org/.\n\nSupporting views on the proposal:\n1.

I believe Nouns is one of the best storytelling protocols as it provides the opportunity for anyone to add to that story in a very meaningful way to proliferate the meme. With Aaron “Wheelz” Fotheringham and my team, we will create a story that will capture the hearts and minds of Nouners and people outside of the Nouns ecosystem alike and provide on-chain lore for future creatives to play around with.\n\n**TL;DR:**\n- Create a 5-7 minute Nounish documentary that dives into Wheelz' amazing story and follows him in his journey to do **the first triple back flip in a wheelchair**\n- Produce raw content and b-roll around the entire project to be released as CC0 on [everydayforever.wtf](http://everydayforever.wtf)\n- Upon completion, we will submit a droposal to have the documentary minted as an Open Edition where 50% of proceeds go to NounsDAO and the other 50% of proceeds go to Life Rolls On\n\n**Who is Wheelz?**\n[****Nikki Bella Gets EMOTIONAL As She Hits Her First Golden Buzzer For Aaron Wheelz!****]([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5DI64O15Ow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5DI64O15Ow))\n![https://i.imgur.com/X7BNG4I.png](https://i.imgur.com/X7BNG4I.png)\n\n[****Aaron \"Wheelz\" Fotheringham INSANE Wheelchair Athlete Top Moments in Nitro Circus History****]([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nw7tsMVnvrw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nw7tsMVnvrw))\n![https://i.imgur.com/DZDkKRm.png](https://i.imgur.com/DZDkKRm.png)\n\nWhen I first started ideating what I wanted to do with my first proposal, I thought back on all of the people I’ve met that resonated with my interpretation of the idea of Nounishness and Wheelz was one of the first people I thought of. He’s an incredibly genuine human that lives life in an absolutely full send way. He’s been on tour with Nitro Circus, participated in X Games, holds multiple Guinness World Records and has been featured on ESPN, CNN, and Bleacher Report.\n\nI asked him one day, “what’s something crazy you want to do?” He responded with, “I’ve wanted to do the first triple back flip in a wheelchair for a while now but haven’t gotten the time to work on it.” I got goosebumps and immediately started figuring out how we could make this reality.\n\n**What are we doing with Wheelz?**\n\nWe will create a Nounish documentary that follows Wheelz through the journey of executing **the first triple back flip on a wheelchair**. A doc that gives you a window into Wheelz’ story and the story of him doing the unimaginable - filled with joy and perseverance but doesn’t take itself too seriously. This story will serve as a piece of Nouns lore to be enjoyed and to be forked for future Nounish content.\n\nTo execute this, we will first need a mega ramp. Luckily, we’ve connected with a mega ramp builder that has built ramps for the likes of X Games and Nitro Circus and he’s willing to rent his ramp to us for our short doc.\n\nHere’s the crazy 30-foot mega ramp that we would be using:\n\n![https://i.imgur.com/eWSeRKg.png](https://i.imgur.com/eWSeRKg.png)\n\nThe ramp is awesome, right? Next, we need a team that is capable of producing a Nounish documentary. This is why I’m bringing in Zack Patrick - who is a talented friend of mine that can handle all aspects of this documentary from the action sports videography to the drone footage to the storytelling. Below you can find some of his amazing work:\n\n[****The Art of Surfing (Sponsored by Jackery)****]([https://vimeo.com/721340785](https://vimeo.com/721340785))\n![https://i.imgur.com/7UtbK0L.png](https://i.imgur.com/7UtbK0L.png)\n\n[****Can I Kick It?

Like I said above, this documentary will be as Nounish as possible - joyful, creative, inspirational yet it doesn’t take itself too seriously.\n\nIn addition, we will Nounify the entire documentary by procuring a Nounish custom wheelchair, Nounish marketing materials for the mega ramp, a large inflatable pair of Noggles to have on set of the triple back flip, and some Nounish goods already created and funded via NounsDAO. \n\n![https://i.imgur.com/mR5OivM.png](https://i.imgur.com/mR5OivM.png)\n\nWhen we finish the short doc, we will premiere it on Youtube and Twitter and then send a droposal to the DAO to release it as an open edition where 50% of the proceeds will go back to NounsDAO and the other 50% will go to Life Rolls On - a non-profit organization picked by Wheelz that is dedicated to improving the quality of life for young people affected by spinal cord injury and utilizes action sports as a platform for inspiring the infinite possibilities beyond paralysis. \n\nWe will also launch [everydayforever.wtf](http://everydayforever.wtf) as a CC0 repository for select footage we take during this process. We want to encourage collaboration and inspire creators to experiment with all of this Nounish content we’re creating. As part of the proposal, we will also be managing, maintaining and expanding on the collection of Nouns CC0 material on everydayforever.wtf for a year.\n\n**Timeline**\n\nOur aim is to have everything delivered within 6 months at the latest. \n\n**The Future**\n\nWhat a great thing to think about. I hope to tell more awesome stories about Nounish folks in my life and bring them into the ever-growing Nouns Universe. Leveling up with each proposal, making you all smile and having fun is the goal.\n\nWith [everydayforever.wtf](http://everydayforever.wtf) I want to collect and aggregate as much Nounish CC0 material in one place so that anyone from anywhere can build on top of the magic we’re building here. \n\n**Team**\n\n**Dwight Torculas (Noun 64)** - Previously, I was the cofounder & CEO of the music NFT company Mint Songs which was recently acquired by Napster.

I do not approve of its model. Spending $150,000 to create a rigid politically correct story for Nouns is a very bad sign. This proposal follows the traditional brand operation mindset of funding special groups and shaping their own brand image. Now NounsDAO funds an inspirational star who knows nothing about Nouns and has done nothing for Nouns, implanting a positive and optimistic brand spirit in everyone, which is an extremely rigid and inflexible brand strategy that does not fit with Nouns.\nNoun's brand is a completely different model from previous brands; it is a headless brand where people feel the project's branding characteristics from community members' experiences. For the branding of Nouns, vivid stories or creatively concise memes should be used to enhance culture and build community consensus rather than funding a celebrity who has no understanding of Nouns. I strongly oppose the 256 proposal, which uses a solution that is fundamentally incompatible with both our thinking and operational methods to shape the Nouns brand.\n2.

Let’s be where developers, creatives, and entrepreneurs gather to build. The Nouns Fair is the space to have fun, experience culture, build, and proliferate Nouns all at once!\n\n## WTF?\n\n> **The Nouns Fair is an IRL experience that aims to spread Nouns among hackers and builders in web3.**\n\nAs ETHGlobal states, they are growing the most valuable developer community in web3. At their hackathons, engineers, designers, and product leaders come together for three days to collaborate on building something amazing. The Nouns Fair is a dedicated space for them inside the hackathon where we create a fun nounish atmosphere. This makes Nouns associated with a positive and memorable experience.\n\nThe Nouns Fair serves different purposes to help hackers learn about Nouns:\n\n- **Awareness** – hackers taking pictures at our photo sets and wearing cool Nounish swag\n- **Learning** – we spend three full days answering questions about all things nounish\n- **Building** – there will be a pool of 5k in prizes for nounish projects\n\n> **The Nouns Fair is perfect for creating a builders’ cycle on a weekend.\nAwareness > Learning > Building > Proliferation > Awareness > …**\n\nWe can’t miss this opportunity to put Nouns in the eyes of thousands of talented hackers!\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/yiRMrzj.png)\n\n## So far…\n\nWe’ve hosted three editions of the Nouns Fair at ETHGlobal hackathons: in Mexico, Colombia, and the USA. After three editions we've confirmed the importance of this kind of event to increase awareness, onboard potential builders, and put noggles in the eyes of thousands. \n\nWe managed to put Nouns and noggles in the eyes of:\n\n- 3,700 people in\n- 3 cities: Mexico City, Bogota, and San Francisco, during\n- 9 full days of nounishness with\n- 3 Nouns Fair editions\n\nAll this blended with the local culture:\n\n- Piñatas\n- Games\n- Candies\n- Fortune cookies with nounish luck and a\n- Nouns flower power VW bus\n\nWe also distributed nounish swag, including:\n\n- 800 t-shirts\n- 600 pins\n- 1,600 stickers\n- 400 POAPs\n\n**Nouns Fair Mexico**\n![](https://i.imgur.com/uF8U2f9.jpg)\n\n**Nouns Fair Bogota**\n![](https://i.imgur.com/7ZwmTqR.jpg)\n\n**Nouns Fair San Francisco**\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Uv5vAcJ.jpg)\n\n**Want more photos?** Here are [our photobooks on Flickr ↗︎](https://www.flickr.com/photos/196499305@N03/albums).\n\n**Want videos?** This is the vibe of each of the editions of the Nouns Fair!\n\n**Nouns Fair ETHMexico**\n[![](https://i.imgur.com/4ZuQBNS.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRTegTUFwHM)\n\n**Nouns Fair ETHBogota**\n[![](https://i.imgur.com/mMKxNuc.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qe1R5WFT9_E)\n\n**Nouns Fair ETHSanFrancisco**\n[![](https://i.imgur.com/FIi1QYh.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ij0MoUOV-OE)\n\n**Want more proliferation?** Since the Nouns Fair happens inside the hackathon, ETHGlobal video recaps have been nounified, putting ⌐◨-◨  in the eyes of the Ethereum community.\n\n**ETHMexico Recap**\n[![](https://i.imgur.com/655mczu.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPNu1QTxC0w)\n\n**ETHBogota Recap**\n[![](https://i.imgur.com/hbPrIn1.png)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMbtSPFB9j0)\n\n**ETHSanFrancisco Recap**\n[![](https://i.imgur.com/Z5n7jdR.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHiIMvGLBZc)\n\n**Want more details?** Here are more detailed reports of each Nouns Fair edition on Discourse:\n\n- [Nouns Fair at ETHMexico report ↗︎](https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/small-grants-nouns-fair-eth-mx/1777/6?u=mono) (Funded by NSFW)\n- [Nouns Fair at ETHBogota report ↗︎](https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/nsfw-nouns-fair-ethbogota/2326/7?u=mono) (Funded by NSFW)\n- [Nouns Fair at ETHSanFrancisco report ↗︎](https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/nsfw-nouns-fair-ethsanfrancisco/2709/4?u=mono) (Funded by NSFW and reimbursed via [on-chain ↗︎](https://nouns.wtf/vote/162))\n\n**Want some alpha?** San Francisco's fair was used as the set for the Nouns Documentary – hopefully, we'll make it to the cut 🙊\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/wZPO9lM.jpg)\n\n## What do people say about the Nouns Fair?\n\nHundreds of people have enjoyed previous editions of the Nouns Fair. Their faces of joy smashing piñatas, getting candies, winning a T-shirt for playing foosball and just having a good time taking pictures with giant noun heads and learning about Nouns says it all! – We asked a few folks to tell us a bit of their experience at the Nouns Fair.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/2ZWPge6.png)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/3rH2ePX.png)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/IJ8Esyu.png)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/yHSz1Kp.png)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/48wpqHW.png)\n\n## What is the plan?\n\n**The Nouns Fair will be a cultural experience focused on builders where they will be able to engage with others, learn and build with Nouns.** These activations will be localized nounish experiences with photo opportunities, games, swag, and dedicated hosts answering every question about Nouns and building.\n\nWe want to keep onboarding international builders and help others create on top of Nouns. To do so, we plan to go to six IRL ETHGlobal hackathons forecasted for 2023.\n\n1. **[ETHGlobal Lisbon ↗︎](https://ethglobal.com/events/lisbon)**: May 12 → May 14 \n2. **[ETHGlobal Waterloo ↗︎](https://ethglobal.com/events/waterloo2023)**: June 23 → June 25\n3. **[ETHGlobal Paris ↗︎](https://ethglobal.com/events/paris2023)**: July 21 → July 23\n4. **[ETHGlobal New York ↗︎](https://ethglobal.com/events/newyork2023)**: September 22 → September 24\n5. **[ETHGlobal Istambul ↗︎](https://ethglobal.com/events/istanbul)**: November (TBC)\n6. ETHGlobal Devcon: Q4 (TBC)\n\nCountries and dates may change during the year. We’ll adjust accordingly as things unfold.\n\n**More info:** [Announcing the 2023 ETHGlobal Season article ↗︎](https://ethglobal.medium.com/announcing-the-2023-ethglobal-season-3cc1960de7b4) / [Updates to the 2023 ETHGlobal Hackathon Season ↗︎](https://ethglobal.medium.com/updates-to-the-2023-ethglobal-hackathon-season-1d2a9d418c91)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/X5XHeIZ.jpg)\n\n## What to expect?\n\nAfter three editions, we now know that making people's first experience with Nouns fun and meaningful makes the perfect environment to be receptive about wtf is Nouns, how the DAO works, and how people can collaborate. \n\nThis year we'll focus on making builders build with Nouns by doubling our efforts on incentivizing them to materialize their ideas with Nouns from the start. We’ll introduce a new way to learn the nounish vibe and encourage people to build in-site with Nouns: the **Nouns Prize.**\n\n### **Nouns Prize – wtf?**\n\nPeople hacking at the event will get a chance to learn about Nouns by going to the Nouns Fair inside the venue. They will learn they can build on top of Nouns immediately at the hackathon and be rewarded. This is a way to showcase the nounish vibe and incentivize the use of Nouns to build whatever they can imagine. Hundreds of hackers building with Nouns all at once like a massive Nouns Prop House flash round – can you picture that?\n\nThis prize aims to reward builders that:\n\n1. Use Nouns art\n2. Build for the Nouns community\n3. Build public goods using Nouns\n\n**Doing this at every hackathon will help to a) have a dedicated window to onboard hundreds of skilled builders, b) get familiar with the Nouns’ culture, and c) incentivize building constantly.** \n\n> **More builders, more props, more proliferation.**\n\nImagine hackers building with Nouns as they already do with protocols and tools like Polygon, Lens, MetaMask, Uniswap, Aave, etc.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/b60kgr5.png)\n\n### Culture á la Nounish\n\nThe Nouns Fair's experience results from great design, excellent execution, and blending of cultures. We wrap all this in a concept we call **culture á la nounish**.\n\nWe've done it differently in each country. In Mexico City, we did it with rustic hand-painted fair stands, games, candies, and nouns piñatas. In Bogota, with a high-quality printed stage highlighting local cultural imagery along with traditional games, toys, and candies. And in San Francisco, with a 60's flower power VW bus and custom Chinese fortune cookies. All this with a pinch of swag. \n\nWe'll keep blending local culture with Nouns in this year's editions of the Nouns Fair. We're excited about the richness of culture this year's locations will bring.\n\n> **Proliferation and culture á la nounish**.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/JIEHA7N.jpg)\n\n## What is the budget?\n\nWith the experience we’ve had in the previous Fairs, we’ve kept what works best and made some changes, adapting both to each city’s event expectations and social media needs + the Nouns Prize for hackers.\n\nTo make this reality, **we ask for $226,425 USDC worth in funding**, which we'll allocate as follows.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/7MSFqnV.png)\n\n*Note 1: The Photo Set, Culture à la Nounish, and Traveling & Accommodation sections are considering a 5% buffer to cover potential changes in prices and schedules throughout the year.*\n\n*Note 2: For security, all funds will be managed by a 3/5 Safe (0xFB35d8B136729D3aB74d687E482F3D16CE18d89C) including Ale, Mono, the Nouns Fair wallet, [Necfas ↗︎](https://twitter.com/necfas), and [Franklin ↗︎](https://twitter.com/franklinvargas).* \n\n## Who are we?\n\n- [Alejandra, Nouns Amigos nounder ↗︎](https://twitter.com/ale_pjimenez)\n- [Mono, Nouns Amigos nounder ↗︎](https://twitter.com/0xMonografia)\n\nWe want to turn the Nouns Fair into a vehicle that can proliferate and attract builders anywhere in the world. We've done it in three countries and want to keep adding more this year.\n\nWe are two nounders of Nouns Amigos, the community for all Spanish speakers. We onboard, encourage, and help our amigos to build with Nouns. We are nounifying Latin America and beyond.\n\nWe've been active with Nouns Amigos since June 2022. We've done weekly Twitter Spaces since then (now part of the regular TNS Soapbox schedule), three editions of the Nouns Fair, and [created Nouns Amigos hub in Prop House ↗︎](https://prop.house/nouns-amigos) which has funded 19 props in two months including [two breakdancers that want to qualify for the Olympics in 2024 ↗︎](https://prop.house/nouns-amigos/ronda-1/3281), [a giant skateboarding noggles rail in the Dominican Republic ↗︎](https://prop.house/nouns-amigos/ronda-1/3360), [these Godzilla-size Nouns in the streets of Bogota ↗︎](https://prop.house/nouns-amigos/ronda-1/3368), [8 Meetups in 5 Latam countries ↗︎](https://prop.house/nouns-amigos/reuniones-a-la-nounish), [sponsored a sub-champion MBT racer ↗︎](https://prop.house/nouns-amigos/mantente-nounish/3748), [sponsored an Ethereum Guatemala conference ↗︎](https://prop.house/nouns-amigos/mantente-nounish/3705) and [more ↗︎](https://woolen-sapphire-e03.notion.site/January-March-2023-d4aceb12e9a44a56960bc8639afd5675)!\n\nBut most of all, we've gathered the Spanish community on [Twitter ↗︎](https://twitter.com/NounsDAOAmigos) and [Discord ↗︎](https://discord.gg/MDvvuUkNYT) under Nouns Amigos!\n\n## FAQ\n\n- **In a tweet, what are you trying to do?**\nBring the Nouns Fair and introduce the Nouns Prize to six ETHGlobal IRL hackathons.  Let’s be where developers, creatives, and entrepreneurs gather to build. The Nouns Fair is the space to have fun, experience culture, build, and proliferate Nouns all at once!\n- **What is the budget?**\n$226,425 USDC\n- **Have you done this before?**\nHell yes! – We've done the Nouns Fair three times: Mexico, Bogota, and San Francisco. Also, we’ve run four Prop House rounds with Nouns Amigos.\n- **Why does it matter?**\nIt's a blending of culture, fun, building, and proliferation. The perfect environment to attract builders, make them experience what feels like building with Nouns and getting rewarded.\n- **Who’s the Nouns Fair team?**\nWe are Alejandra and Mono from Nouns Amigos. We handle everything from ideation and planning to management, logistics, design, and hosting. In addition, we hire local businesses and individuals to help us host the fair, produce the photo sets, swag, and record the events.\n- **More questions?** Ping us on Twitter: [Alejandra ↗︎](https://twitter.com/ale_pjimenez) or [Mono ↗︎](https://twitter.com/0xMonografia).\n\n⌐◨-◨ ","proposer":"0x0C66d954d9cb1ebDF4E37a000262323C83655e70","startBlock":16916482,"endBlock":16952482,"executed":true},"votes":[{"support":1,"voter":"0x17a01dB837345772F2E65Adf2fb4f4DE10ac1B72","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x2ED22eA03fEA3e5BD90f6Fdd52C20c26ff6e1300","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x1db19B9903c5510AA5a866ea643Eb021CD12Bda0","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":"Good Aspects:\n- Increased awareness and engagement with Nouns in the web3 developer community through IRL presence hackathons.\n- Onboarding international builders and fostering a global community.\n- Strengthening the Nouns brand by associating it with positive and memorable experiences.\n- Encouraging developers to build on top of Nouns through the Nouns Prize.\n- Promoting cultural exchange and diversity by blending local culture with Nouns in each event.\n- Previous success with three editions of the Nouns Fair, demonstrating the team's experience and commitment.\n\nBad Aspects:\n- The team will rely on external help for hosting, photo sets, swag, and recording, which may result in varying quality across different events.\n- Events may be subject to change, and the team will need to adjust accordingly.\n\nThe past success of the Nouns Fair demonstrates that Mono & Ale are experienced and committed to achieving their goals. Budget seems reasonable considering the scale of the project. The impact of previous Nouns Fairs can't be ignored, having a nouns-powered set on the global events that involve one of the main target demographics seems very worthwhile. best of luck, keep up the good work.

In this world, we would have no need for rules or principles. But in our world, voting is a reality. So we have a simple rule: we only vote against. We use a “Squad Vote” for each proposal. If more people vote against than vote for or abstain, we vote against on-chain. Otherwise, we abstain. This is our rule.\n\nAccording to the “squad vote” result for proposal 257, which is 13 for, 19 against and 14 abstain, we choose to vote abstain.The viewpoints of our different members are as follows (source not listed):\n\nOpinions opposing this proposal:\n1. The past three Nouns Fairs seemed to prioritize creating a lively atmosphere more than genuinely onboarding builders, and they did not showcase Nounish ideas and products born at hackathons (perhaps it's not apparent yet, as some builders might not have built products on the spot but developed ideas later).\n2. Financial details are excessively indulgent: (1) the average cost of each fair is $38,438, while the bounty for rewarding builders is only $5,000, accounting for 13%, with the rest considered as marketing costs; there is too much budget allocation for marketing surrounding the Hackthon; (2) after three iterations, some aspects could be standardized and streamlined to avoid reinventing the wheel, such as reusing materials, resulting in instances of financial waste; (3) the costs for each event vary, but in planning, each is set the same; if the funds are not fully used, will they be returned to the treasury?\n3. Data does not meet expected plans. The organizer's initial goal was 1,000 Twitter followers, but after the first event, the actual number was 580. After hosting three events, Nouns Amigos currently has 1,200 followers, with the growth rate gradually decreasing and an average of 300 new followers per event.\n4. In Proposal 180, the team pledged to save funds, with excess funds to be returned to NounsDAO. However, this statement is removed in the current proposal, and after 36 hours of inquiring on Discord, there has still been no response. The team has made some changes in the crucial details of the proposal's financial aspect. It makes me feel that the team deliberately doesn't want to clarify the issue of financial waste, and I am concerned about whether the team might obtain undue benefits from the implementation.\n\nSupporting views on the proposal:\n1. The issue is not whether the proposal should be implemented, but rather its cost-effectiveness. Raising Nouns' influence at Ethglobal IRL hackthons is something that should be done, with cost-effectiveness being a secondary concern.\n2. The team can establish a professional Web3 event standard operating procedure (SOP).\n3. The team has a track record of three successful events. The current Twitter followers are 1,000+. The average cost per follower is $50,000/1,000, or $50 per user. The data performance is at least average.\n\nPoints of uncertainty include:\n1. I have not been to ETHGlobal in Mexico, Bogota, or San Francisco, so I cannot understand the local atmosphere. Moreover, the most important aspect of offline marketing proposals is the specific implementation by the two members; we need to hear firsthand opinions from those who have interacted with them. \n2. Although team have been able to execute events in the past, the team seems to have abandoned many original principles and become increasingly wasteful in the proposal, which makes me cautious.\n3. NounsDAO proposals may exhibit a pattern of gradual governance attack. This starts with a few Small Grant deliveries, then bundles what should have been several small proposals into one large proposal, delivering low-quality results and pocketing the funds in between. This is an issue with the NounsDAO system. The NounsDAO system is imperfect, lacking supervision and feedback for long-term large proposals, as well as continuous incentives, potentially causing good actors to turn bad. Could Proposal 257 be an example of this gradual governance attack pattern? How can we solve this problem?\n4. There are many conflicting thoughts regarding NounsDAO's financial scrutiny:\n4.1 I believe that strict financial control will not yield good results, as financial systems need a mature community culture and relevant modules. Insisting on stringent requirements for any financial aspect in the absence of a solid foundation will do more harm than good to the system.\n4.2 I think a 30% premium above the market rate is acceptable. Extra profit will make proposal deliveries more standardized and sustainable, reducing the sense of confusion and uncertainty for the implementing members on the cutting edge.\n4.3 I can also understand the strict financial stance is resonable; if there is a 70% reduction in financial advocacy, then a 30% reduction in the financial budget may also be acceptable to the community. We should stick to strict financial discipline."}]},{"prop":{"id":258,"description":"# Nouns x W3BSTOCK in NOUN YORK CITY!!!!\n\n### Preface\nI'm sponsoring this prop because I believe in the initiative, but have no involvement beyond sponsorship. Please direct any questions and conversation to the builders proposing - Brian and Bloomz.\n\n\n## TLDR \n\nWe're requesting 10 ETH to make Nouns DAO a Title Partner of W3BSTOCK NYC, a global live entertainment consortium that empowers artists and revolutionizes the music industry using blockchain technology. By partnering with W3BSTOCK, Nouns DAO will gain significant exposure and align itself with the top-tier global web3 music and arts ecosystem, which is growing rapidly in New York City. The partnership will involve Noun-focused activations, merchandise, and branding throughout the event, targeting a diverse audience of over 1,500 attendees, and providing long-term value to the Nouns community.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/ZaAkO29.jpg)\n\n## Intro\n\nNOUN YORK CITY 2023!!!\n\nGM Fellow Nouners! \n\nAt W3BSTOCK, our core mission is to proliferate live music and beautiful art into a wider consciousness while providing creators with the tools to pave a more equitable music industry. By leveraging cutting-edge technologies like blockchain, we are spreading education around these tools and showing creators how to drive new forms of revenue, fan engagement, and artistic expression. We believe that by empowering artists, we empower the world, disrupting the outdated music industry and creating a more vibrant and equitable future for all involved. We would LOVE for the Nouns DAO to join us on this exciting journey to revolutionize the world of music and art.\n\nWe are a NYC-based, global live entertainment consortium powering the decentralized music industry, with a core team from diverse live entertainment production entities like Brooklyn Bowl, Relix Magazine, The Capitol Theatre, Lockn' Music Festival, Central Park Summerstage and Universal Music and from artistic and musical members of bluechip NFT communities like the Bored Ape Yacht Club, Crypto Punks (Spottie Wifi is in the DAO), Gutter Cat Gang, Nouns, Lil Nouns, The Visitors, The Alien Boy, and many more. Our organization integrates best-in-class web3 tools and communities to produce concerts, music festivals and other meaningful, memorable experiences in real life, all doubled in the metaverse, all framed around a global mission to fix the live music industry through blockchain to create a better future for creators, venues, event organizers and fans. \n\nFollowing the successful Nouns activations at W3BSTOCK Miami on December 1st, 2022 and the W3BSTOCK x Lil Nouns Denver party on March 4th, 2023. We now have the opportunity for Nouns to make a lasting impression within the W3BSTOCK live music and arts ecosystem, which will reverberate across the thriving New York City web3 community in the artistic and musical epicenter of NFT.NYC and beyond. \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Y0Cyr22.jpg)\n\n## Event \n\nW3BSTOCK will kick off NFT.NYC this year on the eve of the conference, Tuesday, April 11th with a massive event bringing together over 40 leading music acts from the web3 music ecosystem like Dyl, Rae Isla, Domino, Violetta Zironi, Nifty Sax, The CART3L, Fifi Rong, Jadyn Violet, and Taylor Alexander, and over 30 high profile NFT tastemakers like Dave Krugman / ALLSHIPS, KYD Labs, Aptos, Metasill, Tokenprooof, and many more - This is the biggest lineup of web3 artists playing a single stage in history and we have the opportunity to get the Nouns DAO front and center of not only the NYC event, but the big picture mission at the core of W3BSTOCK: To proliferate live music and beautiful art into a wider consciousness.\n\nW3BSTOCK was hands down the most popular music and art event the day before NFT NYC last year and I expect this year will be no different. With an expected attendance of over 30,000 attendees at NFT.NYC this year, W3BSTOCK realistically projects an attendance of over 1,500 educated, diverse attendees for their event, including in-person attendees and metaverse attendees with organic social media impressions exceeding 20,000. \n\n**Note:** the vast majority of the NYC web3 music community are NOT widely aware of the Nouns DAO and what we are doing - hence the opportunity.\n\nThis is an unprecedented opportunity to align the Nouns community with the top tier global web3 music and arts ecosystem that is emerging from New York and rapidly spreading around the world. We will onboard new community members from the W3BSTOCK music and art community into the Nouns DAO, and we will ensure that the Nouns are tethered inextricably to the paradigm shift that is just beginning for artists and creators. \n\nThis is a different type of NFT event. It is solely focused on live music, beautiful performances, and interactive art activations, rather than a dry panel of speakers or a bunch of speculative crypto bros. \n\nW3BSTOCK has already proliferated incredible web3-enabled music and arts programming in New York, Las Vegas, Miami and London, with forthcoming parties coming up at Bitcoin 2022 in May and at W3BSTOCK Sydney in August. For this reason, I would like Nouns to have a leading presence at this event, so that the Nouns will continue to be a leading cultural tastemaker in this good-to-grey web3 music ecosystem over the long term.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/7JLOGHx.jpg)\n\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Rq4b0gB.jpg)\n\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/P8n3obSl.jpg)\n\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/QpTuXL3l.png)\n\n\n## Description\n\nWe are requesting 10 ETH for **Nouns** to become a **Title Partner** of W3BSTOCK NYC with a complete Nounish takeover of the entire event, including a fully Nounish Photo Booth with a direct social media integration. We will also get Noggles on leading web3 music influencers like Dyl, Violetta Zironi, Rae Isla, and more, on the eve of the conference so they can rock them for the remainder of NFT week and aid in the cultural Nouns proliferation. This will make a large splash and kick off a week of Nounish proliferation at NFT NYC and will also generate loads of awareness for Nouns DAO and their mission.\n\nThe funding breakdown will be as follows:\n\n10 ETH For Title Partnership that will get us:\n* Premiere, exclusive sponsorship of the event which would make it the official Nouns NFT NYC kickoff event\n*  20’x20’ Official Tastemaker IRL Vendor Booth, placed prominently at the main entrance to the event with 2 dedicated 33” Metasill screen and projector to display Nouns NFTs at the front and center of the event\n*   Allow Nouns to curate parts of the event **designing high end fabricated scenes for the photo booth and other pop up activations** at areas all across the event venue\n*   A Nounish photo booth with direct social media integration and a pre-made tweet / IG template that has Nouns tagged. We will offer a free NFT claim to anyone who posts a Nounish photo and tags the Nouns to incentivize an online network effect, and we will offer future utility to these holders at future events within the music and arts web3 ecosystem\n*    100 comps for Nouns holders - which grants access to the immersive VIP Groove Room, open bar, and on site swag and other giveaways\n* Nouns featured with top, premiere placement on invite and promo materials \n* Nouns featured prominently in signage at the event\n* Nouns inspired specialty cocktail on bar menu\n* Branding and link to Nouns.wtf in the Metaverse livestream component of the event\n* Branding across social assets\n* Branding on emails linked to the event\n\n* 50 custom Nouns x W3BSTOCK t-shirts to be given away to holders (first come, first served)\n* 8’ x 8’ Nouns @ W3BSTOCK Step-and-Repeat \n* 47” x 81” Nouns Retractable Banner (which we will carry around and display at multiple events throughout NFT NYC) \n* Noggles for swag bag and for handing out across NFT NYC \n* W3BSTOCK-included VIP table for Nouns community at Nolcha Shows x Crypto Punks event with 3,000 attendees on Weds, April 12th\n* A **guaranteed Nounish activation at the W3BSTOCK x Nolcha Shows** party at the SLS South Beach during Bitcoin 2023 on May 25\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/wUNMk3p.jpg)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/RDfdQaR.jpg)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/NOT5FzY.jpg)\n\n## ROI To The DAO:\n\nI will show the DAO several returns on investment from this activation from financial, to brand awareness, to growth marketing. I will be collecting data via POAP mints, distributed merch to holders, and social media impressions. We will keep a thorough list of tags on every social platform, Nouns.wtf and nouns.wft link visits during the week, and will provide a full write-up on all of the nounish interactions with artists and creators and the W3BSTOCK event and across NFT NYC. \n\nI will provide a total of **3 reports to the DAO**. The reports will provide **follow up analytics after 7 days, 30 days and 90 days**. The stats I will be tracking are:\n\n•**Branding and proliferation** of Noggles all across NFT.NYC with an estimated 20,000 organic social impressions\n• **Hundreds of photos** of W3BSTOCK and Nouns and other nounish people at the step-and-repeat including leading web3 music and cultural influencers\n• **Website Traffic** to Nouns.wtf \n• **Purchases** - We will have a number of POAP kiosks throughout the event where attendees will mint our Nouns @ W3BSTOCK NFT NYC POAP. Through this, we will have a list of wallet addresses that I will then check those addresses at the 7 day, 30 day and 90 day checkpoints to see if any of those wallet addresses now own a Noun (purchased after the event date)\n• **Photos** either tagging Lil Nouns or Nouns and/or containing Noggles, pulled from every social media platform at 30, 90 and 180s out from the event.\n• **Aggregated brand impressions** from all social media, web visits and NFT purchases post event at each checkpoint\n\nBy proliferating Nouns and Lil Nouns at W3BSTOCK Miami and also our collab Denver event, and also knowing all about W3BSTOCK last NYC event at the same venue, I have been able to see first hand how to best proliferate the nounish brands among the W3BSTOCK arts and music ecosystem. The biggest impacts include:\n\n• **Interactive art**, screens and live minting POAP experiences, and step-and-repeat activations\n• **A strong presence** at the event with a premium booth & Noun maxis to chat with & answer questions\n• **Live music** - This has been oft overlooked in building the Nouns communities and I believe we have massively untapped awareness within the thriving web3 NYC music and arts web3 scene - This proposal will instantly fix that\n• **Branded tote gift bags** handed out to holders \n• **Stickers** - people love collecting stickers and we saw tons of them up around various places in Miami and Denver\n• **T-shirts** - Branded W3BSTOCK x Nouns t-shirts turn attendees into marketing evangelists, and people who come to events and have a great time (like, all of them) are happy to wear merch around to other events at conferences and also post on social media  \n\nIf this proposal is funded we will officially be partnering with the first-to-market and leading web3 music and arts ecosystem which is thriving in New York City. This will allow allow for nounish proliferation over an entire week, not only in W3BSTOCK’s live music and arts ecosystem, but in and around the largest NFT conference in the entire world, in the greatest city in the world, **NOUN YORK CITY!!!!**\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe music industry has long been plagued by problems that hurt artists and fans, and this is the most ripe space for blockchain disruption, and this particular use case and demographic has been largely overlooked by the Nouns DAO .... until now. \n\nWe believe that blockchain technology is poised to create a more equitable future for artists, fans, and industry professionals alike. By leveraging the power of blockchain, we're able to provide a platform that enables direct artist-to-fan engagement and fair revenue distribution, cutting out middlemen and gatekeepers who have historically taken a large chunk of the profits. Our organization also provides creators with new ways to monetize their work, such as through NFTs and fan token offerings, creating new forms of revenue streams that were previously unavailable.\n\nLike the Nouns, at W3BSTOCK, we're not just speculating about the possibilities of blockchain technology - we're making it a reality. This is why we believe that a partnership like this would represent such a mutual value and bear very long term fruit for the Nouns and independent creators across the globe. \n\nI believe that one of the core focuses in our shared goal of proliferation the Nouns DAO should be empowering creators, and what better way than to proliferate Nouns to artists and musicians? These are the truest arbiters of culture. Musicians and artists say what is cool, they define culture. We get leading web3 artists and musicians rocking the Nouns brand ... and the world will follow. \n\nBy getting involved with W3BSTOCK, we'll be at the forefront of a music, art, and creator revolution, disrupting the outmoded music industry and creating a more equitable future for all involved. \n\nThank you for considering this proposal, and here's to a brighter future for music, art and the world!\n\n## Team \n\n* **Brian Stollery** - Hi!

In this world, we would have no need for rules or principles. But in our world, voting is a reality. So we have a simple rule: we only vote against. We use a “Squad Vote” for each proposal. If more people vote against than vote for or abstain, we vote against on-chain. Otherwise, we abstain. This is our rule.\n\nAccording to the “squad vote” result for proposal 258, which is 0 for, 30 against and 0 abstain, we choose to vote against.The viewpoints of our different members are as follows (source not listed):\n\nOpinions opposing this proposal:\n1. This is not community building. It's merely Satori and Bixbite doing business with Nouns, a business that is not advantageous for Nouns.\n2. Satori and Bixbite's remarks in the Jungle channel, such as \"Lil Nouns is cheap so I gave them a cheap\" and \"Lil Nouns is a toxic environment,\" further convince me that they do not understand the spirit of the community. They display arrogance toward the individual community members, treating DAOs and communities as cold numbers. This is the worst and most repulsive proposal and proposers I have encountered.\n3. NounsDAO needs to operate in a community-driven manner, incubating more teams that understand and love the Nounish spirit. Today, NounsDAO has many teams that both love Nouns and can produce outstanding work. Yet, W3BSTOCK only seeks to be an outsourcing team, proposing a disadvantageous business deal.\n4. I will continue to oppose such activities that use exposure as a gimmick. The traditional growth model that relies on increased exposure is effective because it has a unified company and growth system behind it. However, the conversion rate of each aspect of this growth method would plummet in NounsDAO, rendering it ineffective. NounsDAO's growth engine comes from numerous small teams that love Nouns and have comprehensive capabilities, as well as the establishment of specific social relationships.\n5. Nouns may no longer need this type of exposure.\n\nSupporting views on the proposal:\n1. A dedicated event organizer possesses sufficient professionalism.\n2. They have participated in the Lilnouns community and observed the Nouns community. Although they mayn't to adapt, they have their own understanding of decentralized governance issues.\n\nPoints of uncertainty include:\n1. Bitcoin has never rejected anyone. Conflicts between native and external teams can be observed in various projects. On one hand, I have seen cases where bringing in professionals to solve problems for projects ended poorly. Native teams must build every module from scratch, and there are no shortcuts. On the other hand, the MakerDAO model shows that, despite severe conflicts between native and external teams, they are not mutually exclusive at the protocol level. Instead, they should be embraced by the protocol."},{"support":0,"voter":"0x1db19B9903c5510AA5a866ea643Eb021CD12Bda0","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":"similar reasons as krel's reasoning.

We received coverage from [**Animation Magazine**](https://www.animationmagazine.net/2023/03/stoopid-buddy-teams-with-nouns-dao-to-fund-nft-inspired-short-shorts/) and have a simple [**Nouns Stories**](http://nounsstories.wtf/) website with further links.\n\n5 of these animators were selected through our [**Prop House round**](https://prop.house/nouns-stories/nouns-short-shorts-season-1), which is now complete. We had 67 wildly talented applicants offering a variety of animation styles: 2D, 3D, stop motion, mixed media. The Prop House link has all of the submissions, including the 5 winners.\n\nAt the same time, our team commissioned 5 additional animators from our personal networks. We are excited to announce them - they are fantastic animators with significant careers and social followings. After this proposal we will announce all animators together in a press release.\n\nBoth the Prop House round and commissions have successfully caught the attention of world-class animators. We are onboarding some very talented people to Nouns, even helping some set up their first crypto wallets. It feels like we've hit on something special.\n\n## FUNDING MORE SHORT SHORTS\n\nMany great creators applied to the Prop House round and selecting only 5 was a challenge. We would love to fund a few additional Short Shorts from this pool of talent, as well as commission some more from our own networks. This extra animated content will be very useful for the IRL film festival we're planning.\n\nWe're looking for $52,500 USDC to fund 7 more animations:\n\n - 5 additional Prop House shorts ($7500 USDC x 5)\n - 2 additional comissioned shorts ($7500 USDC x 2)\n\n## HOSTING IRL FESTIVAL IN LA\n\nExcited by the caliber of animators, we would like to rent a venue in Los Angeles and host an IRL festival event. The organizing team has significant connections in the LA Animation / Film industries and we plan to invite our professional networks, friends, and the general public to enjoy some Short Shorts and learn about Nouns. We will screen all of the commissioned animations and other Nounish videos. The event will be livestreamed for anyone around the world to enjoy.\n\nThe budget will cover things like venue rental, event staff, audiovisual equipment, food/drink, and further marketing costs as they pop up.\n\nIRL Festival budget - $12,500 USDC\n\n## THE FUTURE\n\nThis first round of animations and the festival event are a pilot for a decentralized, CC0 Nouns festival dream. We intend to develop Nouns Short Shorts into a recurring global phenomenon, an infinite stream of animated Nounish content.\n\n## BUDGET\n\n7 x Short Shorts - $52,500 USDC\nLA Festival Budget - $12,500 USDC\n\n**TOTAL:** $65,000 USDC","proposer":"0x281eC184E704CE57570614C33B3477Ec7Ff07243","startBlock":16965688,"endBlock":17001688,"executed":true},"votes":[{"support":1,"voter":"0x17a01dB837345772F2E65Adf2fb4f4DE10ac1B72","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0xDEAD753f9B1eb8F2f7372E8587e7C6e342daac89","numberOfVotes":2,"reason":"The submissions were incredible.

The 2023 Summer Season will begin in May and culminates with a Major in Bali in late June.\n\n**DreamLeague Season 19**\nOur Dota team was invited to a 1 million dollar tournament as one of the 16 best teams in the world. This tournament circuit is ran by ESL, the biggest esports company in the world. Our success at this event will allow us to participate in a 15 million dollar grand final later this year.\n![](https://images-ext-2.discordapp.net/external/sDgIIzb2UMj-OTHG8G4POauhmFeRE95o3oartDmdi84/https/pbs.twimg.com/media/FrqIBzJWYAEvYSZ.jpg)\n\n**Blast Paris Major 2023 North American RMR** \nThe Counter Strike sticker opportunity. Our team is in Monterrey Mexico, competing against top teams from the Americas for a spot at the [Paris Major](https://liquipedia.net/counterstrike/BLAST/Major/2023/Paris) in May.\n\n**IEM Dallas**\nOur CSGO team has qualified for IEM Dallas starting May 29th. IEM Dallas is an S-Tier event just barely below a Major. It will pit Nouns against the worlds best international teams, with hundreds of thousands of viewers. 2022's iteration (pictured below) had over 12.5 million hours watched and a crowd seating thousands.\n![](https://i.imgur.com/DmQCdf3.png)\n\n## Proposal Success Metrics & Vision\n\n- Tournament wins and participation\n    - Continuing to compete at some of the biggest tournaments in the world, such as Majors and The International\n- Viewership \n    - Due to the success of our teams we expect to be at significantly more tier one events than last year. Regular 10K to 100K+ viewership is expected\n    - The highest view count so far was 200.000+ live viewers during a nail-biting series against MiBR at the CS:GO NA RMR\n- Social media growth\n    - Approaching 7000 followers on our main Twitter account & multiple of our players have over 50k followers\n    - Discord server with 2400 members in total and a growing group of active contributors\n- In-game branding\n    - Dota will continue to have Nouns assets thanks to participation in the Pro Circuit\n    - In CS, we need to qualify for an upcoming Major, doing so would guarantee permanent Nounish branding inside of the game\n- Acquiring additional partners aligned to our Nounish ethos\n    - We'll seek partners that share our values and vision for long-term growth, prioritizing alignment with our Nounish ethos\n    -  Nouns Esports can have multiple sponsors supporting our competitive initiative, and we will prioritize aligning with sponsors that share our values and vision for long-term growth\n- Onboarding\n    - Gamers have typically been wary of the crypto space due to a lack of understanding and perceived complexity. However, the similarities between the gaming and crypto ecosystems, such as digital ownership and online communities, make them well-suited for each other\n    - Nounish culture extended into esports has proven to be an amazing onboarding tool and we believe we can bridge the gap between gaming and crypto, showing gamers the potential benefits of crypto and its applications in and beyond the gaming world\n\n\n## Risks and Challenges\n\nAs an organization, it's crucial to consider the potential risks associated with discontinuing support for our esports teams. These teams are not just a source of entertainment for the community but also a representation of our brand and values. If we abruptly stop supporting them, we risk losing the trust and loyalty of the community we have worked hard to build.\n\nAnother challenge that esports teams face is potential fluctuations in performance during the competitive season. To mitigate this risk, it's important to provide necessary support expected of tier one rosters, including management, coaching, bootcamps, and wellness support. This helps maintain the players' focus, discipline, and motivation, especially during challenging times.\n\n## Budget\n\nFunding two professional esports teams for a minimum of 10 months.\n\n#### **Rosters**\n- 340,000 - 465,000 USDC\n    - Two teams consisting of five players and one coach (12 people in total)\n    - 125000 reserved for incentive payments, meaning it will be reflexive of the performance and effort put forth by the teams\n\n#### **Bootcamps** \n- 20,000-120,000 USDC\n- Funding the best practice opportunities prior to important competitions\n     - Considered an essential need for top esports rosters\n     - Costs may be reduced depending on the number of sponsored bootcamps (e.g. our Dota team has already received a free bootcamp in Europe during April, paid for by the organizers)\n\n#### **Support Staff**\n- 210,000 USDC\n    - We are providing industry-standard support staff for these rosters\n        - Two player managers who travel to events with the teams & organize their lives around regular competition\n        - Professional wellness staff \n        - Support staff for logistics, social media & content\n\n#### **Total: 795,000 USDC** (~435 ETH at current prices)\n---\n### **Multisig**\n\nWe will be using the same multisig that was created for [Proposal 119](https://nouns.wtf/vote/119) consisting of Nouners and Nounsfolk.

In this world, we would have no need for rules or principles. But in our world, voting is a reality. So we have a simple rule: we only vote against. We use a “Squad Vote” for each proposal. If more people vote against than vote for or abstain, we vote against on-chain. Otherwise, we abstain. This is our rule.\n\nAccording to the “squad vote” result for proposal 263, which is 13 for, 14 against and 19 abstain, we choose to vote abstain.The viewpoints of our different members are as follows (source not listed):\n\nProposal 263 has presented us with a conundrum, making it difficult for us to render judgment. The Nouns Protector has just been established, and it may take approximately six months for clarifying our principles. We will briefly summarize the debates from our meeting:\n\nNouns Esports has accomplished laudable outcomes, genuinely creating a stable organization to underpin esports teams' operations. This initial step is laden with myriad challenges that remain beyond our imagine. And, they have admirably maintained fiscal transparency throughout the process.\n\nDespite their successes, the community has voiced concerns about the long-term viability of Nouns Esports as a business. Should Nouns Esports evolve into an entity that perpetually depletes NounsDAO's cash flow, depending on ceaseless transfusions from NounsDAO for sustenance, this model would not be sustainable for NounsDAO in the long run.\n\nFurthermore, NounsDAO ought to concentrate on cultivating a more diverse and populous community. Some members posit that:\n\n\"\nNouns should channel resources into domains where it possesses an unambiguous competitive edge. Esports is not a realm where NounsDAO holds a competitive advantage. The Matthew effect is conspicuous within esports events, with elite teams monopolizing the lion's share of attention and securing funding that far exceeds $800,000. This sector is fiercely competitive. Nouns Esports cannot amass a competitive cache of funds, which means they cannot engage top-tier players nor establish a premier support infrastructure. Consequently, they will only gain exposure in regional championships and open tournaments (as evidenced by their historical performance), unable to penetrate truly valuable core events.\nWhat merit is there in allocating excessive funds to a sphere where NounsDAO can only assume a secondary role, particularly for an organization in its nascent stages, with a community treasury of a mere $50 million?\n\"\n\n\"\nMore effective use of funds could be achieved by allocating 700 ETH to incubate 10 vibrant subculture DAOs across diverse fields, rather than expending a relatively negligible amount of funding to compete in conventional events.\n\"\n\nMoreover, cautionary reminders have been raised about the pervasiveness of intimate personal relationships within NounsDAO:\n\n\"\nProposals prior to Proposal 200 have made considerable contributions to NounsDAO's present public image and clout. However, it has also engendered a nexus of relationships, with many decisions swayed by personal connections and predispositions.\nIf NounsDAO is to pivot towards a more lucid, native, and 'truly growth' trajectory—championing a broader array of NounishDAOs—the community networks forged during the preceding strategic round may serve as impediments. As a result, more resources may be funneled towards politically correct but inefficacious marketing proposals, suppressing the potential for vibrant but peripheral creators to enter the Nouns ecosystem.\n\"\n\nNotwithstanding any criticisms, Nouns Esports remains an outstanding member of NounishDAO. Additionally, esports represents an excellent conduit for Nouns to interface with the external world. We extend our hopes and blessings for Nouns Esports to persist and excel."},{"support":1,"voter":"0x13eEf4EF8FCa471f242ab0F8F49A3dB6017aDA33","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x31A50FD42b910c635e4d25B63b7b90FAd1451695","numberOfVotes":2,"reason":"Nouns Esports: Very Ugly ⌐◨-◨ "},{"support":0,"voter":"0x5cA40836E6473a495148972a13Dd9014797C0e92","numberOfVotes":2,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x0055CD5F017027D10ADF4f13332181e6D8D886BB","numberOfVotes":2,"reason":""}]},{"prop":{"id":264,"description":"# Launching Nouns Vacation Summer Brand 2023\n\nHi Nouners, we are planning to propose launching a Nouns Vacation Summer Brand for this summer.\n\nWe are an experienced team capable of end-to-end operation (design, production, marketing, event-hosting) of the brand.

Better design plan below.]\n\n---\n\nAs one of the primary means of interacting with our online world, keyboards are more than just a tool – they've become a personal expression. Until Neuralink becomes available, let's design a keyboard that we love to use every time!\n\nNextMech and I are excited to create a Nounish Mechanical Keyboard (MK) in collaboration with a top tier keyboard designers. With our internal MK knowledge and technical ability, we have planned a project that ultimately launches a Nouns sub-DAO for an enthusiastic subculture!\n\n### Overview\n\nOver the years, [an online subculture has emerged (partial MK ecosystem stats)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15W-Io9Y8zjAwppzKt9UkSLhiGImyQgc8J9M1UUUvh6o/edit?usp=sharing) that cherishes their custom keyboards as works of art. This community has developed its own workflow called the group buy, where artists share designs for collectors to pre-order. After pooling the funds, the designer approaches a vendor to manufacture and deliver the product. Similar to web3, projects are decentralized across social media and different websites, [and they also have meetups around the world](https://twitter.com/search?q=%22mechanical%20keyboard%20meet%22&src=typed_query)! Using the existing manufacturing infrastructure, we can improve the UX by utilizing NFTs, DAOs, and open-source software, to bridge the two communities!\n\n![MK_meet](https://i.imgur.com/p8ph93F.jpg)\n[SF meet March 5th 2023 with a photoshoped Nouns MK - [original photo](https://twitter.com/villi/status/1632132746029182977)]\nOther meetups can be seen by searching for [\"mechanical keyboard meet\"](https://twitter.com/search?q=%22mechanical%20keyboard%20meet%22&src=typed_query).\n\n### Us\n\nNextMech and I (profish) began working on a project called Mechies which won a small prize in a 2022 Australian hackathon. We thought about MK NFTs in the form of generative art with manufacturable traits, DAOs as Vendors for group buys, hardware-embedded signatures, etc., to help improve the ecosystem. Then, at the beginning of this year, we were introduced to [Gami](https://twitter.com/0xigami) through a buildoors group in Australia. He told us about the profound model of Nouns, and it quickly became clear that a collaboration would help proliferate the brand and support the MK subculture. His tremendous support and knowledge has helped shape a sustainable plan for this project!\n\n### Nouns x MKs\n\nThe proliferation synergizes immediately with existing channels. For example, the Nouns Esports team could incorporate the keycaps in their battle stations which would reach gaming spectators - expression of support have been made for collaboration. Or, Nouns keycaps can be given as POAPs to hackathon participants and winners, Nouns keyboards would be taken to keyboard meet ups around the world, photos of Nouns keyboards and keycaps will be showcased on popular online forum with millions of visitors, and so on. But we plan to go further than these channels and use Zora's Nouns Builder to create a MK DAO and continue to support MK enthusiasts!\n\n### Future\n\nThe MK DAO and the general infrastructure supported by this grant can become a platform that improves group buys for designers and collectors. Designers can leverage NFTs to offer their work as mints. They can go further by turning their existing Discord communities into DAOs, where the community can have greater input and ownership in the products they purchase. Also, the collectors who mint these designs benefit from the social media integration of NFTs, for better showcasing of their collections. In fact, we have already begun curating this platform by commissioning different MK artists in the current process, with many more collaborations in the pipeline!\n\nAlso, a long-term experiment that we are considering involves addressing IP issues in the ecosystem. [Designers face a challenge in protecting their intellectual property (IP) when running group buys](https://www.theverge.com/22905351/mechanical-keyboard-keycap-clones-imitators-knockoffs-olivia-biip). While stopping counterfeits for keycaps and general products is very difficult, authenticating the keyboards may be feasible. By using [VIA, an open-source software integrated with all keyboards](https://www.caniusevia.com/) and working with manufacturers, we could link keyboards to NFTs for potentially increasing their social and monetary value for collectors.\n\n### Summary Plan\n\nWe will work with a top tier MK designer and manufacture the keyboards for the NFT minters. We aim to sell and manufacture 1-2k units with a unique marketing strategy that involves selling keycaps of various sorts to complement the keyboard. This provides an incentive for us to proliferate Nouns, reduce prices and gather foundational members for the MK DAO!\n\nFinally, the entirety of this project will be a great example of real-world adoption for NFTs, especially with the new [EIPs for physical NFTs](https://medium.com/@ABCDE.com/abcde-after-studying-all-eips-we-summarized-9-future-directions-of-nfts-648c11f16a4f). It will be a major win for Nouns to be early and supportive of a devoted subculture that is growing! Take, for example, the subscriber count for the /r/MechanicalKeyboards subreddit:\n![MK_subreddit_stats](https://i.imgur.com/ynIRz2l.png)\n[Here is a small data set that we have gathered on the ecosystem to provide more context.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15W-Io9Y8zjAwppzKt9UkSLhiGImyQgc8J9M1UUUvh6o/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n**With that said, here is a simple cost breakdown to make it all possible. We have already begun tracking expenses in our Notion and will continue to do so for the rest of the project. If there is a surplus we will allocate to other productive activities that further the project. More detailed breakdown and Q&A at the end:**\n\n- 52 ETH for manufacturing setup of however many mints but a guaranteed amount of 260 units including buffer, prototypes and YouTuber review units. With couple hundred spare keycap sets.\n- 10 ETH for assembling (80+ hours of labor), storage until redemption and safe high priority shipping.\n- 21.69 ETH for marketing of digital and physical assets including keycap airdrops of various different types.\n- 35 ETH for team and contractors, managing production, technical, graphics and starting/supporting the MK DAO.\n\n**Total - 118.69 ETH**\n\n---\n---\n## Detailed Plan\nCustom keyboard manufacturing involves two main components: the case and keycap set. Switches and other components are also significant, but they are less customizable; therefore, we will simply use enthusiast-grade products. For a more detailed overview of mechanical keyboards, [check out this intro made by NextMech](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gRH83pF1RBXW6Eve_OLC9Fb7hAlxQQEP/view?usp=sharing).\n\nTo start, a designer will incorporate the Nouns brand into the keyboard canvas. We are considering a collaboration with several designer who can create an aesthetic Nouns-themed keyboard. These designers can combine the MK culture and Nouns brand for a pleasing design. These include [BIIP](https://instagram.com/biipmk), [NoPunIn10Did](https://nopunin10did.com/kat-napoleonic/), [sourmk](https://www.instagram.com/sourmk), pikku-allu, dededecline who would be able to combine different themes into their work. Also, a design by a top artist plays a major role for introducing Nouns to the MK community, ensuring a high-quality product that enthusiasts will enjoy. Here are some of the works by the mentioned designers:\n\n![biip_dots](https://i.imgur.com/6WupSai.jpg)\n[BIIP Dots]\n![Pikku_allu](https://i.imgur.com/EsoOGd7.jpg)\n[Pikku Allu Symbiote]\n![nopunin10did](https://i.imgur.com/mNWDioS.jpg)\n[nopunin10did DSS Late Harvet]\n![sourmk_dandy](https://i.imgur.com/fJDs1nY.jpg)\n[Sourmk Dandy]\n\nFor manufacturing, our first choice is a company that builds based on their available catalog of cases and can also assist with packaging and shipping. However, for a better quality design, we are prepared to carry out a more bespoke model by working with different suppliers. NextMech has experience with both approaches and after accounting for trade-offs and constraints, we are confident on delivering a high quality product. The bespoke approach will start at a higher unit cost, but it's still within the financial plan. Also, it's well worth trading off additional costs for a better design!\n\nAfter finalizing the design, we will begin reviewing prototypes from the manufacturer(s) to confirm the colors and build quality. This will give us the confidence to replicate the design as an NFT, one that will be minted through after a project update. The mint will be priced at approximately 0.3-0.4 ETH depending on final unit cost and ETH price, with a discount for Nouns holders which brings price to near cost. It will have boolean-based redemption on [nouns.mk](https://nouns.MK) since we don't want to burn the NFT so that it can be shared online, and also allows for over the air updates through VIA software.\n\nPrior to and during the minting of the NFTs, we will launch marketing efforts to increase the visibility of the project. Proliferating the brand through community activity which also aligns with our incentive to reduce unit costs. A portion of the mint will be used to help start the MK DAO built using Zora's Noun Builder. We will support the MK DAO by managing further collaboration and manufacturing processes. Also, in addition to the daily auctions for the DAO, people who participated in the physical marketing events will gain access some access to the DAO.\n\nYou can start participating by [minting the momento NFT](https://zora.co/collections/0xbe11ce87505d41b6848f37cba26820d89b060a3e) where the glasses will be [magnetic](https://www.instagram.com/p/Cp0Q-juJ-_Y/?img_index=1)! Some participants will win this with their keyboard!\n[![noun_keycap_board](https://i.imgur.com/06G1uuC.png)](https://zora.co/collections/0xbe11ce87505d41b6848f37cba26820d89b060a3e)\n\nThe physical marketing is in the style of MK communities, which will be on in addition to the digital media marketing. We are working on various exciting strategies for minters; some include resin keycaps with 3D Nouns characters inside, two piece magnetic and modular keycaps, novelty keycaps with Nouns themes, high-quality metallic keycaps, a fully custom 1/1 keyboard made for auction, hackathon POAP keycaps redeemed in person and more MK designer and influencer collaborations! These will have various pricing mechanisms to maximize accessibility for collectors and start the MK DAO.\n\nHere are some examples (not a real design) of a Nouns keycap NFT for physical marketing, which can be redeemed in the same way as the main keyboard NFT. It's a great addition to the custom keyboard once it arrives, or it allows MK enthusiasts to join the community with their existing keyboard!\n\n![noun_keycap_board](https://i.imgur.com/xON1kBh.jpg)\n![noun_keycap_board](https://i.imgur.com/FFxttkm.png)\n[Not a real design, for conceptualization of single keycap only - by boardbay]\n\nOnce manufacturing, assembly, and quality testing are complete, the NFTs can be redeemed. They will be stored with a distributor or manufacturer and can be redeemed at any time. It is possible to sell the NFTs prior to redeeming them. \n\n### Current Progress\nAll progress will be made public on our Notion page, where we keep info that is up to date. Here are some highlights from the current progress:\n- Talking to two manufacturers and shared general idea to confirm production and timeline feasibility.\n- In contact with mentioned designers and discussing collaboration terms.\n- Quotes and plans on keycap marketing with various designers.\n- Registered [Nouns.mk](http://Nouns.mk), twitter account [@nounsmk](https://twitter.com/nounsmk), [nounsmk.eth](https://app.safe.global/home?safe=eth%3A0x144975eEc9674fd0Af3d6F3FBa8D660879cE3881) and nounsmkdao.eth.\n- Project outline and public workspace for the entirety of the project, with more details to be added as the project progresses.\n\n## Team and our MKs!\n**[Profish](https://twitter.com/profishcrypto) (product)**: My past experience is software engineering work for crypto trading companies and tokenomic simulations in cadCAD. Also, as part of the DAO Under community, I've project managed the build of a DAO framework to support crypto builders in Australia.\n\n**[NextMech](https://instagram.com/next.mech) (MK expert)**: Michael runs a boutique custom MK business and has a deep understanding of the industry. Additionally, as a full-stack developer, he can effectively plan with the constraints of a physical NFT projects!\n\nHelping us will be **Joy Chiang (artist)**: She has helped some of the most successful NFT projects in Australia and has a family of MK enthusiasts!\n\n![team-MK](https://i.imgur.com/nEN1vIF.jpg)\n\n## Detailed Phases (8-12 months)\n\nThese are the major phases in the project and the estimated timeline. The building and marketing phase will be ongoing as the keycaps are mini NFT projects for the community. [Here is an early view of the timeline in our Notion, we will make it more accurate as we progress through the stages.](https://www.notion.so/5046938e65264b02b9d86c117289b98e).\n\n### Phase 1: Design\n- Start momento manufacturing for two piece magnetic keycap\n- Start commissions on physical marketing assets (1/1 keyboards, keycaps, NFC keycap, designer collab, keyboard head nouns for MK DAO, etc.)\n- Work with designer to finalize design (also communicating with manufacturer for feasibility)\n- Replicate keyboard design as an NFT\n- Update [Nouns.mk](http://Nouns.MK) with final design and soft launch\n- Update task board and add more detailed overview given new information\n\n### Phase 2: Marketing\n\n- Release mint of redeemable keyboard NFT\n- Digital marketing assets based on keyboard design\n- Continuation of physical marketing\n- Gather designers and collectors for MK DAO\n\n### Phase 3: Build\n\n- [Nouns.mk](http://Nouns.MK) update for redemption process and collection view\n- Ongoing build of NFT smart contract for physical marketing assets\n- Beginning MK DAO design and implementation for existing community\n- Exploring VIA experiment for 1/1 keyboard\n\n### Phase 4: Delivery\n\n- Manufactured, packaged and begin shipping for redemption\n- Online launch events and plan in person launch event\n- Small gatherings at existing MK meetups and crypto conferences\n- Launching MK DAO\n\n![timeline](https://i.imgur.com/Ox4IW82.png)\n\n\n## Detailed Costs (8-12 month project)\n\nThese are the costs with a small margin of error to account for challenges that arise during physical goods manufacturing. But we aim to be efficient and transparent with the budget in our Notion. The ETH is transferred to mechies.eth which has 3/4 threshold including Profish, NextMech, Zaak (from Zora) and Gami.\n\n### Manufacturing - 52 ETH\n\n- Tooling setup for a minimum of 200 units at approx. 400 USD depending on design complexity. Aiming for 1-2k units to reduce unit cost to 300.\n- 100-200 keycap sets only for future sale.\n- 15% supply buffer for quality control issues (but they will be available for selling when we see that there are no issues with the supply)\n- 4 units for prototypes 0.7 ETH each (including shipping)\n- Tooling setup for manufacturing (case layout, colours, materials, testing, handling supply chain, etc)\n- Post manufacturing processes such as etching, quality checks, and assembling\n- Remaining parts such as PCBs, switches, frames, screws, badges, etc.\n\n### Delivery - 10 ETH\n\n- Assembling and Packaging\n- Storing in warehouse until shipment\n- Shipping with insurance (priority DHL for example) in case of damages or lost property so we can compensate the NFT holder or retry\n\n### Marketing - 21.69 ETH\n\n- Digital assets such as videos, gifs, 3D renders for social media\n- Manufacturing cost of physical marketing assets for give away and raffles\n    - 100 to 200 super custom keycaps: 3D resin, 2 piece keycaps, handmade interactive keycaps, etc.\n    - 400 to 600 Artisan keycaps: basic metallic, infill metallic, plastic, basic resin, CNC etc.\n    - 1/1 fully custom keyboard to be auctioned\n    - Simple keycaps and NFC chipped keycaps as POAPs for hackathons\n    - Novelty keys for the main keycap set\n- Marketing units sent to YouTube and twitch influencers for review\n- Misc: post manufacturing skins, digital art commission, social media posts, etc.\n- Hosting launch event and keyboard meetups \n\n### Team - 35 ETH\n\n- 16 ETH - Managing the project across manufacturing, marketing, tech, admin, community,  subcontractors, delivery, etc.\n- 7 ETH - Website development and tech infrastructure for minting and collecting, open source forks such as Builder DAO and VIA\n- 6 ETH - Designer commissions for MK design and manufacturing spec (CAD files)\n- 4 ETH - graphics, branding assets and website design \n- 2 ETH - misc fees such as gas, spreads, SAAS services, smart contracts, retro costs etc.\n\n**Total - 118.69 ETH**\n\n![MK_heads](https://i.imgur.com/KFLtMUX.png)\n[potential auction art for MK DAO - by instagram@keebpixel artist]\n\n\n## Short Q&A\n\n- **How much is the NFT mint?** Approximately 0.3-0.4 ETH. Nouns holders will receive a discount which brings the price close to cost. We aim to make it affordable by keeping manufacturing reasonable and reduce margin by increasing units. The marketing assets will vary in the form of free, free mint-to-win, at cost, at profit, auctions, free scan to keep and more.\n- **How expensive are MKs?** Custom mechanical keyboards by reputable designers can go upwards of 800-1000 USD. Production is constrained due to the tooling overhaul process, which makes the product rare. Also, NFT feature on top add to that value as we experiment with VIA.\n- **How does the redemption work?** Sharing pictures of MKs online is important, and having an NFT to share is even better. Once you redeem, the NFT becomes non-transferable. Also, it allows for over the air updates through the VIA software for lighting, macros, sounds, etc.\n- **Will the keyboards be assembled?** It is common for the manufacturer to send unassembled keyboards. Assembly is quite easy, as all the components are plug-ins, so if they don't assemble it, we will either work with a distributor or assemble them ourselves. We are even considering an option where the NFT holder can chose between these two options, since the assembling process is part of the experience. However, it's too early to tell if that will be possible.\n- **How long does it take to deliver?** Usually around 10-12 months from the proposal passing to delivery. Keycap sets can sometimes take up to 3 years to deliver, but we are going to make sure that doesn't happen. Also, we think we can shorten this time for future iterations in the MK DAO.\n- **How big is the MK community?** You'd be surprised who likes MK since it doesn't come up in conversation. The forums and Discord servers of designers are similar to or, bigger in size and activity compared to crypto communities. Although, it is pretty scattered online, but I have made a [spreadsheet here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15W-Io9Y8zjAwppzKt9UkSLhiGImyQgc8J9M1UUUvh6o/edit?usp=sharing) to provide some context.\n- **Will there be a sub DAO?** We aim to start one, since there is so much you can do as a community. For example, new keycap styles come out every year, so the DAO can continue commissioning collabs with any theme. We will airdrop supporters, including Nouns to join the MK DAO.\n\n![nouns_MK_samples](https://i.imgur.com/N25XTBo.png)\n[illustration renders of keyboard designs]\n\n---\n---\n#### Relevant links\n\n- Project Notion: [https://mechies.notion.site/Enter](https://mechies.notion.site/Enter-e9a095646e2b49978751c10df85aa12a)\n- Nouns MK site: [nouns.mk](http://Nouns.MK)\n- Nouns MK twitter: [twitter.com/nounsmk](https://twitter.com/nounsmk)\n- Twitter: [twitter.com/mechiesnft](https://twitter.com/mechiesnft)\n- Next.Mech: [instagram.com/next.mech/](https://www.instagram.com/next.mech/)\n- Intro to Mechanical Keyboards: [drive.google.com/file/d/mk_intro](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gRH83pF1RBXW6Eve_OLC9Fb7hAlxQQEP/view?usp=sharing)\n- Small view of the MK landscape: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/mk_eco_data](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15W-Io9Y8zjAwppzKt9UkSLhiGImyQgc8J9M1UUUvh6o/edit?usp=sharing)\n- Twitter search for Mechanical Keyboard Meetups: [meetup tweets](https://twitter.com/search?q=%22mechanical%20keyboard%20meet%22&src=typed_query)\n\n![nouns_MK_samples](https://i.imgur.com/JJtVLr3.png)\n[illustration render of keyboard components]","proposer":"0x144975eEc9674fd0Af3d6F3FBa8D660879cE3881","startBlock":17050274,"endBlock":17086274,"executed":false},"votes":[{"support":1,"voter":"0xA86882277E69FbF0a51805cdc8b0a3a113079E63","numberOfVotes":2,"reason":""},{"support":0,"voter":"0x5606B493c51316A9e65c9b2A00BbF7Ff92515A3E","numberOfVotes":29,"reason":""},{"support":0,"voter":"0x4754b7e3DEde42D71d6c92978f25F306176EC7e9","numberOfVotes":7,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x3B60e31CFC48a9074CD5bEbb26C9EAa77650a43F","numberOfVotes":2,"reason":"As a mechanical keyboard enthusiast, I would be interested in acquiring one of these.

We learned a lot of what worked, and what didn’t. We are asking to be trusted with more capital to bring more talented builders into the Nouns ecosystem.\n\nWe would like to run two more rounds of grants, as well as invest further in the project to attract more talented builders to the Nouns ecosystem through Explorer Grants.\n\n\n## Pilot Round Recap\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/RMqi2Xs.jpg)\n \n\n_What our Explorers have done:_\n\n\n* [Greg](https://twitter.com/gregskril) - built Prop 249 (Solo Staking), built the Nouns API, and NounsList\n* [Drew](https://twitter.com/drewcoffman) - created valuable content about Nouns, crafted a thoughtful video and TikToks, gained Nouns delegation from Wilson and has been voting with reason consistently.\n* [Jackson](https://twitter.com/jackson_felty) - created cookbook.dev/nouns, running a workshop on how to build on Nouns\n* [Tigris](https://twitter.com/tigrisli) - built many, many, prototypes, wrapping up a proposal for Nouns hardware going on-chain after this!\n* Our fifth explorer had to put the grant on pause due to unforeseen work coming up. We are hopeful we can restart their grant or use it for someone else in the second pilot round.\n\nWhat we learned:\n\n\n\n- Grants are an excellent marketing tool for the DAO; by leaning into the funds that we were given, we were able to beat the record of applicants to a Nouns Prop House Round (90) and build a sizable following outside of Nouns, despite no previous traction. **_Therefore, every $ of the grants was used for two purposes: marketing the grant and the actual grant._** If the grants were smaller, we would have gotten less applicants.\n- There are amazing people waiting to be Nouns-pilled who just need a bit of help. Just in our first round, we had to reject amazing applicants who could have contributed great things to Nouns and just needed a bit of help. \n- We probably won’t get people to leave their jobs with large Explorer Grants (some of you can say _“I told you so!”_ here). We got few applicants with full-time jobs, and participants who were not tied down to other responsibilities were often able to go deeper on Nouns. ***We want to give alternative, smaller Explorer Grants to talented builders who have other commitments, paired with hands-on support.***\n- Bringing people into Nouns takes time and effort - a lot of the people we talked to weren’t available at the moment, and ***building connections with prospective explorers takes time.*** This is similar to executive headhunting - not as straightforward as finding someone and giving them money.\n- ***Hack Week*** was a lot of fun and a great success with 90 ETH deployed, hundreds of participants, and dozens of new contributors to our community!\n\n## Goals for this round\n\n***Our #1 priority is to continue bringing top talent into Nouns.***  We want to fund 5x as many builders while maintaining the quality of the Pilot Round - we have an ongoing list of people who were highly interested but unavailable during our original application period. We’ll continue our main grants by doing two cycles of 6 grants of 6 ETH each. We may also use Prop House’s infinite rounds to run part of our smaller Explorer Grants, which Nouners will be voting on. \n\nOther objectives:\n\n\n\n- **Re-invest into the EG talent pipeline:** build out a community, build out a strong decentralized brand for Explorer Grants, and create content that brings in more talent from outside of Nouns. This will require paying people outside of the main team.\n- **Contribute to the Nouns dev ecosystem:** we ran Nouns Hack Week and would like to continue efforts like it, build out content for Nouns builders as a whole, and be stewards of Nouns contributors. \n- **Participate in governance:** we’d like 1 Noun to support Explorers and Builders (we are currently paying for delegation). This also doubles as an equity-like payment to the Explorer Grants team so that we can share in the upside of Nouns.

It can be configured with settings that define how it can bid: MinBid, MaxBid, Tip, BidWindow, and the recipient of Nouns won.  Once configured, anyone can submit a transaction to force the contract to bid. Calling `bid()` refunds gas and rewards the caller with a small tip, ensuring the AutoBidder consistently runs.\n\nThis Nouns AutoBidder will be deployed with the following settings: \n\n- MinBid: `30 ETH` \n- MaxBid: `30 ETH`\n- BidWindow: `24 hours`\n- Tip: `0.001 ETH` (tip is an incentive for anyone to kick off a bid)\n- Receiver: `0x0BC3807Ec262cB779b38D65b38158acC3bfedE10` (treasury)\n- Contract Balance: `31 ETH`\n\nThese settings will allow the AutoBidder to place a bid of 30 ETH whenever a new\nauction starts until funds are exhausted or the contract is paused.\n\nMore info can be found on how the AutoBidder works here: [Github Repository](https://github.com/nounish/autobidder)\n\n## Currently used by\n\n[Lil Nouns prop #115](https://lilnouns.wtf/vote/115) deployed v0.1 of AutoBidder for Lil Nouns to extend their\nacquisition of Nouns. \n\nWizards followed suit, deploying v0.2 of AutoBidder (which extends v0.1 with support for setting ENS reverse records).\n\n**Links to AutoBidders**\nWizards: [Etherscan Link](https://etherscan.io/address/0xb16f24e94ffe751e283a30905a9B2606605c3A46)\nLil Nouns: [Etherscan Link](https://etherscan.io/address/0x3F09354832C67a27510601530C9E9F6Ea39E2544)\nAutoBidder Factory: [Etherscan Link](https://etherscan.io/address/0x5a2DA0F09d65a0034F4398BdA40df4F8A79a3293)\n\nFederation was funded in [prop #229](https://nouns.wtf/vote/229)\n\n[wiz](https://twitter.com/0xWiz_)","proposer":"0x13eEf4EF8FCa471f242ab0F8F49A3dB6017aDA33","startBlock":17063814,"endBlock":17099814,"executed":true},"votes":[{"support":1,"voter":"0xe412186A1865c4fE54A79e0AdcB08b81233DF674","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":"AutoBidder provides an interface for the DAO to acquire new Nouns with parameters (e.g., MaxBid) we agree on.

Everyone can see the min and max bids, and so there is effectively a floor price on the auction. The incentive for the DAO and Noun holders would be to see the max bid realized and so someone could repeatedly bid (and get tips) from the auto bidder, and then outbid it, and bid again until the max bid is reached. I think in most cases it is better for someone to use a human bidder that cannot be gamed like this. If someone wants to bid at a specific price for a Noun they can just us a collection offer? \n\nThat said, it sounds like Lil Nouns is already using this and is happy with it, and I am glad to hear it is useful to them. Beyond my concerns on the mechanism design, I don't see a reason for Nouns DAO to use this right now. \n\nFrom Twitter I gather that there is some idea here that this should be used to replace Nouns Acquisition Committee (NAC). I do not think this is a good replacement, and I would rather hold out for the paradigm where the DAO can directly vote to mint someone a Noun.

These original songs were commissioned [by Gnars for 3 ETH](https://snapshot.org/#/gnars.eth/proposal/0xbb73acb16a3b968a7cde352cf046b7d015b0dde0bce3a6d16355d28cf9d519e8) and this droposal marks our official [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/public-domain/cc0/) release of the music and cover art. \n\n---\n\n## ⚡️ TLDR\n\n- Gnarly EP is a 3 track CC0 release\n- Extremely nounish originals by Lil Bubble\n- Attached txs deploy Zora timed open editions\n- Droposal only with no funding requested\n- Nouns get 10% of mint proceeds\n\n---\n\n## 👨‍🚀 Introduction\n\nLil Bubble is an established Web3-native character who has been releasing satirical songs and music videos for the community since 2019. His songs and remixes put a tongue-in-cheek spin on market events and have clocked **OVER 10 MILLION VIEWS**, adding to the cultural fabric of the space with a comedic blend of music, video and niche subject matter.\n\n[![](https://i.imgur.com/5EwyJEF.jpg)](https://twitter.com/TheCryptoBubble/status/1587404329262030849)\n\nHis engaged crypto-centric audience and alignment with Nounish values (using creative remixes and finely-crafted memes to contribute to Web3 culture) make Lil Bubble a great asset to Nouns. He has been a strong supporter and participant in the Nouns community - has featured Nouns in a previous music video, was one of the earliest members and supporters of Gnars DAO, has been a special guest in a number of Noun Square Twitter spaces, and is currently working on his own Nouns fork.\n\n## ⭐️ Previous Nounish Work\n\nLil Bubble featured Noun 189 and owner [Gami](https://gami.wtf) in a music video in August last year. A custom Noun skateboard was featured in the video which was shared widely throughout the community garnering over 370k impressions and 145k video views on Twitter alone.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/5ZkITFM.jpg)\n\nLil Bubble grew up skateboarding and his continued support of Gnars DAO has helped us broaden our collector base. The three tracks produced for this EP have made a huge impact on our community, with \"Never Gonna Grow Up\" having already found its place as our anthem. \n\n## 🚀 Launch Plan\n\nEach of the three tracks are being released as timed open editions.

Owner will be set to gnars.eth following drop.*\n\n## 📝 Artist Remarks\n\nAs one of the first members of Gnars DAO it was fun to finally make some music for my favourite crew! There were a few elements to incorporate into the EP - Gnarly skate references, up-beat Nounish vibes, 8bit sound design, and Lil Bubble's signature crypto moonboy motif. I wanted each song to be a different style to keep things interesting. \n\n### Never Gonna Grow Up\n\n[![](https://i.imgur.com/iz4QGdx.jpg)](https://soundcloud.com/lilbubble/never-gonna-grow-up/s-tNxMPjzxvJN)\n\nThis is my interpretation of Gnars (and by extension Nouns). Skateboarding played a big role in my childhood so being able to re-ignite that passion with Gnars sparks all kinds of youthful nostalgia. Connecting with a new group of people in adulthood and engaging, building and creating together in new ways gives me that same feeling. I'm never gonna grow up!\n\n### Blast Off \n\n[![](https://i.imgur.com/6sM9fSe.jpg)](https://soundcloud.com/lilbubble/blast-off/s-gIVZEDQB0wY)\n\nThis is probably my favourite instrumental on the EP. The trap beat and super simple 8bit-inspired synths are very 'Lil Bubble' and a pretty good glimpse at the direction I'm taking things with my original music moving forward. Lots of Gnars references in the lyrics!\n\n### Level Up\n\n[![](https://i.imgur.com/biGY1Ck.jpg)](https://soundcloud.com/lilbubble/level-up/s-rnUMscL3a6K)\n\nI wanted to step the energy up in the final track, moving in a slightly more tribal direction (Gnars is about extreme sports after all). More skate references in the lyrics - spot the shoutout to celebrity Gnars DAO member Bob Burnquist! I tied things together with plenty of digital glitches and some classic Lil Bubble trader stories. Regardless of which Web3 camp you sit in, you would have no doubt grown familiar with the market cycles and how they affect us all in one way or another. Trading aside, we should always be trying to level up and improve some area of our lives. Like my kickflips...\n\n## 🎁 Bonus Extras\n\n**Bonus 1:** Collectors who mint all three singles to complete the set will unlock a free to claim Collector's Edition EP.

Project Goals For Upcoming 6 Months**\n\n### **The Key Challenges**\nFrom [Prop 176](https://nouns.wtf/vote/176) :\n\n* There isn't currently a main archive center that stores and display all datas like \n    * proposal progress images/videos\n    * end product images/videos/links/repo\n    * nounish artworks from contests, events\n    * cc0 contents & working files\n* It is difficult for new people to discover any nounish contents because it is dispersed everywhere, throughout Twitter, Instagram & other platforms unless they have their own website or media-oriented approach which uses apps like Youtube. Particularly from the perspective of those who do not fully comprehend the Nouns ecosystem and where they might find it.\n* There is no specific rule for proposers to update their project progress everyday, fortnightly, or once a month but we could encourage people to do that more often if we help to provide the right tools.\n* Some builders with huge outcomes but stucked with time constraint need an additional support to archive their outputs.\n\nAs a central resource platform, cross pollination is one of things needed. Some of the early builders require assistance with visibility. With the connected links that point people to each nounish projects and builders, we assist the public in finding them.\n\n### **The Strategies**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/EKvVcFO.png)\n\n**Strategy 1 ; Curated submission form**\n\n* We want to build **a curated submission form** attached to the website which benefits from multiple touchpoints.\n* Users are required for wallet connect (NNS supported) and could request to submit a new sub-category and additional contents to their existing proposals/details.\n* The forms will allow users to select their preferred category, status, type of house, round, etc. *(based on specific usage)*\n* User can check their submission history together with submission details *(eg; date, title & status)*\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/zRGCmYR.png)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/kYzeI8v.png)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/AUrMjNR.png)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/1rQXaEQ.png)\n\n---\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/gVzs6Ih.png)\n\n**Strategy 2 ; Uploader**\n\n* We want to improvise an [uploader](https://uploadr.app/) with some new features which we have built for the past few months.\n* Users are required for wallet connect (NNS supported) & it will be token gated focusing on Nouns ecosystem to use it for free ;\n    * Nounders\n    * Nouners\n    * Nounish Builders\n    * Sub DAOs\n    * Nouns' NFT Open Edition Holders / Droposals *(This Is Nouns, The Wizard's Hat etc)*\n* Anyone who has just got noun-pilled into the ecosystem and want to use it, they may choose from any of the available criteria above. This will gradually benefit the Nouns DAO ecosystem over time.\n* User can check their upload history together with the details *(eg; date, title & arweave link)*\n* The fee of the uploaded permanent data is included under **OpEx** in ***Budget***.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/IoUQQkb.png)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/KFIzROZ.png)\n\n---\n\n**Strategy 3 ; Tooling R&D**\n\n* We want to create and launch tooling research and development that will bring significant effect on the process and project's efficiency and for the DAO where everyone could benefit from it.\n* We will use the fund under **OpEx** in ***Budget***.\n\n**The strategies mentioned are what we are focused on so far, but they are subject to change along the way or the best recommendations from the community. There will be more along the journey.*\n\n### **Data Permanence**\n\n* We are using **Arweave** network to store all the datas due to its one time fee permanent storage and we want to use it exclusively for all storage going forward.\n* Currently, around **40%** of the datas are now saved on Arweave, with the remaining **60%** being processed. *(Currently on Notion)*\n* There have been a few instances where artists or builders have discontinued their hosting and lost their tracks; this is something we do not want to happen again.\n* We want to make sure all datas of Nouns ecosystem are permanently stored in a decentralised manner and is always accessible.\n* We are able to boost the website's performance with the help of **Vercel Edge Network** which offers image optimization, page load speed & automatically data cached on the network.\n* The cost of uploading will be factor in under **OpEx** as per attached in ***Budget***.\n* Publish monthly data report of [archives.wtf ](https://archives.wtf/) for public reference.\n* All compiled datas are stored in [Nouns Archive's notion](https://voadz.notion.site/Nouns-Archive-da52f93301dd4ed59e5b876bd5151d93).\n\n### **RSS Feed**\n\nUtilising a simplified and condensed data feed can be more efficient than navigating through an entire website for the required information, making data feed crucial for individual use cases. That is why we're adding feed as a new feature, to make it easier for you to access the data you need and achieve your goals more efficiently.\n\nWe will provide a few types of feed for the main & sub-category pages ;\n  * RSS feed - /rss.xml\n  * Atom  feed - /atom.xml\n  * JSON feed - /feed.json\n\nThe data we have gathered can be utilised by everyone in the ecosystem for their own unique purposes. For instance, a mini companion app can directly use the JSON feed to list all proposals in NSFW Small Grants.\n\n### **Analytics**\n\nWe believe data transparency is important for the DAO & community. We are using **Vercel's Web Analytics** to get detailed insights. It provides in-depth information about your website's visitors, new metrics like top pages, top referrers, and demographics including information on countries, operating systems, and browsers.\n\nAs of *29th March - 20th April 2023,*\n\n* Visitors & Page Views\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/8LkuQZn.png)\n\n* Panels\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/zPo4dKf.png)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/EUNHjX6.png)\n\n### **Sustainability Strategy**\n\nThe main intention of this project is to provide long-term benefits for Nouns. It serves as main archive center that provides wide media contents all over Nouns ecosystem for public reference. Once the open-source repository is public, we will be able to observe other NFT communities with active builders & projects and who benefits from Nouns' product to use it such as ;\n\n**Possible Candidates**\n* Nouns' extension & derivatives\n* Meebits\n* On-Chain Monkey\n* UMA\n* TinyDinos\n* Anata\n\n### **What's next?**\n\nWe certainly have long-term goals with few phases as we wish to accomplish them gradually. We attempt to avoid by highlighting all of our future objectives in one specific proposal as it sounds overly ambitious as we aim to underpromise and over-deliver. We believe that this will provide long term values and benefits to the DAO. It may not be a direct ROI.\n\nSome ideas worth looking at ;\n1. Preservation of archive material ( physical & digital )\n2. Nouns Archive '23 ( Limited physical edition )\n3. Publications - zines/quarterly\n4. Archive Data Request\n5. Ticketed exhibition of Nouns Archive materials ( ROI to DAO )\n\n---\n\n## **4. Deliverables**\n\nTo be delivered over the next 6 months ;\n* Maintaining & developing [archives.wtf](https://archives.wtf/) with all existing & incoming database of medias & arts in Nouns' ecosystem for the next 6 months.\n* Curated submission form & uploader. *(under Strategy)*\n* Toolings R&D. *(under Strategy)*\n* Nouns Archive repository.\n* RSS Feed\n* Daily nounish post in randomly manner on our social media, [Nouns Archive](https://twitter.com/NounsArchive).\n\n**Short-term checklist** *( to be archived )*\n\n* [Nouns Museum](https://twitter.com/thenounsmuseum)\n* [InternatioNouns](https://twitter.com/InternatioNouns)\n* Nouns AI's Contest\n* Messhup's Cover Art\n\n**Long-term checklist** *( to be archived )*\n\n* Prop House (Other houses, eg ; [Lil Nouns](https://prop.house/lil-nouns), [Nouns Japan](https://prop.house/nouns-japan), [Nouns Builder](https://prop.house/builder) etc)\n* Nouns On-Chain Props\n* NSFW\n* The Noun Square\n* Nouns World\n* Nouns' POAP Art\n\n---\n\n## **5.

One day, he gets hold of a pair of glasses that let him call up Nouns, who are more than happy to use their Nounish powers to bring chaos and adventure into his life. But when a few careless words summon a threat to the Nouniverse, can Caden use the power of language to save the world?\n\nABOUT THE BOOK: The general vibe is Beverly Cleary’s “Ramona” series meets Norton Juster’s “The Phantom Tollbooth.” I’m aiming it at six-to-ten-year-olds, and it’ll be fairly light-hearted: no tragedies, no dead pets, just adventures as the strange and surreal world of the Nouniverse intersects with the everyday home and school life of Caden and his friends and family.\n\nI want this to be a book that kids will enjoy reading on their own and that adults will also have fun reading to them. I’m running it by my favourite eight-year-old as I go, to make sure that the vocabulary level is appropriate and that the whole thing is fun and entertaining to a bright kid.\n\nI’m linking the first two chapters here, as text and as an audio file of me reading them aloud. I’ve got five chapters written so far, out of a planned twelve, and I have a clear outline of how the story will proceed. I expect to release an additional chapter about every three weeks, which I’ll be posting at http://rookswater.blogspot.com. When the whole thing is out, I’ll do some final edits and put together the definitive edition in ebook form. At that time, I’ll post a separate proposal for launching the ebook as a timed open edition mint event.\n\nAudio:\nhttps://youtu.be/_-usP1Qe78c\n\nChapter 1:\nhttps://rookswater.blogspot.com/2023/04/the-nominal-hero-ch-1.html\n\nChapter 2:\nhttps://rookswater.blogspot.com/2023/04/the-nominal-hero-ch-2.html\n\nTHE ASK: I’m requesting 25 ETH. This is for two things. First, to cover my living expenses for the next six months to let me focus on finishing the book. Second, I will be placing the book in the public domain immediately; this means that, unlike with a traditionally published book, I won’t be able to sell things like foreign-language rights, reprint rights, film option rights, and so forth. So this is partly to compensate for the lack of those future revenue streams, which normally provide traditionally published authors with a significant part of our ongoing income.\n\nI’d like to stream this amount over the course of six months. I’ve put up the first two chapters here, I’ll post the third right away on acceptance of this proposal, and then I’ll be posting a new chapter every three weeks, so in just about six months the whole book will be available. I’ll provide the final edited book in .epub and .pdf formats no more than one month after the last chapter is posted.\n\nABOUT TASHA K. ROOKSWATER: Under another name, I’m an author of science fiction and fantasy, primarily short stories and novellas. I’m enjoying the freedom of writing something completely different under this pseudonym. \n\nI’m a newcomer to crypto, but I’m fascinated by the artistic potential of this space. I love the public-domain aspect of Nouns and I’m looking forward to other people building on Caden’s story. I’m a big believer in fanfiction and the collaborative nature of storytelling, and I’m excited to send this book out into the world and see what comes back.\n\nProposer notes:\n \nTasha is a published science fiction author and IRL associate that I introduced to Nouns. I encouraged her to write this proposal because I think she's talented and that our ecosystem will benefit from the participation of more storytellers. Please feel free to follow up with any questions on Twitter: @rookswater and @punk4156.

My analysis of funding requests is:\n1. Is this a public good?\n2. Is this public good something that other organizations won’t fund, or that Nouns is uniquely best to fund?\n\nWriting about the Nouniverse is not necessarily a public good, but public domain writing about Nouns is. Public domain writing, just like CC0 art or freely licensed code, is composable. While the ways it could be remixed may be less obvious, it's equally important as other forms of composable creative work. \n\nMy other lens is whether this is something that other organizations won't fund. There are many established pathways to funding books, even if they are admittedly hard to access. Nouns is also not uniquely suited to funding novels. But at the same time, these established pathways are less accessible for public domain works, which the proposal points out forgoes revenue opportunities. (That is why many books choose CC BY-NC-SA as their license, to ensure that the work is able to be shared freely by readers but not used commercially).\n\nThe concerns that other voters brought up around the size of the ask and the fact that there are other established pathways for funding books are valid. At the same time, public domain composability for books is an important experiment. While I don't yet know what composability will result from this book, I believe that it's a good experiment for Nouns. I am in support of this proposal, but would be more hesitant to vote for similar proposals until we see how the benefits of public domain composability play out for Nouns-related books.\n\n(I would also note that I did read both chapters in full prior to making a decision, and I quite liked them.

We’ve decided to vote against Prop 271.\n\nOur rationale stems from a mix of concerns regarding alignment with the broader goal of NounsDAO, the effectiveness of propagating the Nouns meme, and the justification of the cost of the proposal.\n\nOne of the things that excited us most about joining NounsDAO was its mission of funding public goods and the self-sustaining mechanism it invented to continue to do so. A middle-grade novel strikes us as distinct from more powerful public goods initiatives we’ve seen, like cleaning up trash in Africa or funding the planting of trees. We’d love to see Nouns devoting funding toward bigger, more ambitious projects.\n\nSecond, the proposal contains no plans for distribution of the novel. Key to Nouns’ mission is propagating the meme. Creation of content is important, but the true execution is in distribution. Even if we imagine that the novel achieves moderate success, the distribution will be most potent among children (likely 7-10 year-olds, i.e. the ones who read the novel). In our view, that’s not the target audience for Nouns; the funding mechanism only works if people feel compelled to buy into the community, and creating emotional ties with children may struggle to fulfill the Nouns flywheel (auction funds Treasury → Treasury funds projects → projects increase demand for the auction → and so on) in the short-medium term.  \n\nThird, 25 ETH for this proposal feels expensive, at least with the justification for funds given in the prop. To date, we have tried to avoid debates on the cost of funding associated with proposals, given a key component of Nouns is the ability to easily unlock funding for unique and attention-grabbing experiments. 25 ETH without any plans for exogenous distribution – and simply a plan to release a timed open edition (where demand for the mint will likely be endogenous from the Nouns community) – seems a potentially ineffective use of funds. That’s not to say there may not be a strong justification for 25 ETH without a go-to-market plan; rather, we simply did not see one in the proposal. A more effective request, for instance, would have included detail about market comps for the cost of publication to better benchmark a reasonable expected cost. \n\nThe reason we feel compelled to mention funding here is because we want to prevent the setting of a precedent in which the Nouns Treasury is seen as a free money machine. Funding should be easily accessible, but should match the boldness or proliferation expected with each proposal.\n\nOne thing of note is that the creator feels part of the 25 ETH is necessary to compensate them for forgoing future revenue streams; in other words, the upfront payment covers for the lack of a longer-term stake in the success of the novel. To us, this suggests there may be a better way than pure ETH grants to reward creators for contributing to the community: find a way to give them a stake in the success of Nouns. We’ve been exploring ideas related to this challenge in incentive alignment, and hope to have additional ideas to share with the community soon.\n\nAnd finally, we’re still excited by this proposal and appreciate the author’s hard work. We encourage the author to resubmit a proposal, with a revised plan for funding and/or more detail on distribution for the project.\n"},{"support":1,"voter":"0x9d3BEDE31F1C3b8532b98d8a9569e4B5B3fB6Ba8","numberOfVotes":2,"reason":"On behalf of UglyDAO"},{"support":0,"voter":"0xcc778603D10BdB4865Ff6589b4f48ce8f9887744","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0xe085327c5AD2F77147F10973Fed45Fb19d734F7e","numberOfVotes":3,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x9dfa905f6192ba863AD309A8250F26cf58fE6487","numberOfVotes":2,"reason":""},{"support":0,"voter":"0xF9bf4c994B39D742E568096A04637EDc5E8e6fdA","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":0,"voter":"0x79f08F2e75A8C99428DE4A2e6456c07C99E55da5","numberOfVotes":2,"reason":"Voting against let me ragequit."},{"support":1,"voter":"0x328883ae99bc1BE99e7Adf18Bc1486cdC5477ADb","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":"the noggles, they do nothing"},{"support":1,"voter":"0x93D94557824AC07A30b5B0f44f7CB3E00f9c4191","numberOfVotes":2,"reason":""},{"support":0,"voter":"0x29c5dad7E34d0A27d6F65a0A7E07E4d03Dcd68c8","numberOfVotes":2,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x1766255E71A11f9f9D13aBE3f2840E3f6942Aa29","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0xa4e232FcEedb3f43c8e707F8CF20B6BcF30f10E1","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":0,"voter":"0x60232134f0A9177e5248BC44fC95c2c5EFEf8E1A","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x8321795bdACE7428D4faDFA30C2EE8e727e491e5","numberOfVotes":2,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x8323f1C687F7e2296EC71eE3549a7430ea7Ec730","numberOfVotes":0,"reason":"public domain art that is a reasonable ask (art that gives up IP makes sense to cost more than that which doesn't imo) and with potential for compounding upside. love the effort put in so far, and the chapters written. hope to see this pass"},{"support":1,"voter":"0x36A5Bc205DF1ED65C86301022cfc343a6ce546ff","numberOfVotes":2,"reason":""}]},{"prop":{"id":272,"description":"# Autobidder: Withdraw ETH and set ENS reverse record\n\nThe [Federation Autobidder](https://github.com/nounish/autobidder) was successfully used to acquire [Noun #687](https://nouns.wtf/noun/687)\n\nTo conclude the trial started in [#268](https://nouns.wtf/vote/268) this proposal: \n- sets an ENS reverse record that resolves `autobidder.nouns.eth` to the contract address deployed in [#268](https://nouns.wtf/vote/268)\n- Withdraws the remaining contract balance back to the Nouns treasury (~0.98ETH)\n\n**Links**\nAutobidder address: [0x3E5caBcccFeE5eCC2be1D079f64dA44D595309f3](https://etherscan.io/address/0x3e5cabcccfee5ecc2be1d079f64da44d595309f3)\n\n[wiz](https://twitter.com/0xWiz_)","proposer":"0x13eEf4EF8FCa471f242ab0F8F49A3dB6017aDA33","startBlock":17155064,"endBlock":17191064,"executed":true},"votes":[{"support":1,"voter":"0xb0A2852750b15038cf9b5BE255a483e3063162d7","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":0,"voter":"0xA86882277E69FbF0a51805cdc8b0a3a113079E63","numberOfVotes":2,"reason":"The nouns namespace is a double-edged sword.\n\nOn the one hand, giving builders access to the nouns namespace can act as strong signaling and help boost projects.\n\nOn the other hand, it can create unfair market advantages and act to suppress future (competitive) projects' ability to succeed or even willingness to try.\n\nIm not sure, so I'm voting against this time, but i suspect there's also a decent probability this vote will age poorly."},{"support":1,"voter":"0xAEC4075e4fc8cE829BC4f0cFD5e2fA10dd2b12D1","numberOfVotes":2,"reason":""},{"support":0,"voter":"0x281eC184E704CE57570614C33B3477Ec7Ff07243","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":"I cannot support any official blessing of this technology without full communication of the vision for how it will be used by the DAO."},{"support":0,"voter":"0x3Cbd57dA2F08b3268da07E5C9038C11861828637","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":"A quick summary of my thesis as a delegate: “Nouns has a unique role in the ecosystem as a gathering place around public goods.”\n\nI feel strongly that Nouns should not have a namespace that distinguishes between “canonical” projects and all other projects.

If Nouns begins to bless certain projects with a canonical namespace, it will take energy away from non-canonical projects.\n\nOne simple hypothetical: What if Agora had a canonical namespace at nouns.agora.eth but House of Nouns did not? Is Agora now more “official” than House of Nouns? Should we bless more projects with official namespaces, to put them on a level playing field? What happens when those projects evolve, sometimes in ways that an official namespace would not like?\n\nThis is a slippery slope and I am opposed for that reason. As a courtesy, I registered nounsautobidder.eth and autobiddernouns.eth under my ENS at Papper.eth (also the owner, not the manager, of this ENS). I am happy to transfer these ENS domains to the team, and I am disappointed and a bit surprised that the team did not protect these ENS names prior to putting this proposal up. Canonical namespaces are a slippery slope, so let’s stick to non-canonical ones while norms develop."},{"support":1,"voter":"0xe412186A1865c4fE54A79e0AdcB08b81233DF674","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":0,"voter":"0x70eCe45cDc64A768f936Ccb8aC851578251363e3","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":"Voting with Will Papper and Krel here.

J.D. will introduce Nouns and facilitate proposals across his network of media organizations, artists, and creators. \n\nUnitedTribes aims to become a fully equipped development studio and hub that creates breakthrough Nounish applications, ecosystem extensions, and synergies, starting with several core projects. Wherever possible, UnitedTribes will use existing Noun community resources, builders, and tools. \n\n# **WarpedWorld + Nouns ⌐◨-◨**\nThe Warped community includes millions of fans and thousands of participating artists, athletes, gamers, and cultural and philanthropic organizations. Warped has a long history of successful brand partnerships.\n\nJ.D. & UnitedTribes will bring the WarpedWorld project to the Nouns ecosystem. As one of the most ambitious web3 projects for an established brand, WarpedWorld promises to break new ground.

Both projects focus on generating Nounish benefits while fostering community.\n\n**Digging Deep into J.D.’s Network & EIR experience**\n\nAs both an entrepreneur and EIR, J.D. will draw on his experience to bring additional projects and communities to the Nouns ecosystem. For example, inspired by the recent “Wizard’s Hat” short film and Wizard Nouns, J.D. has already introduced the concept of a potential Nouns collaboration with the Wizarding World of Harry Potter, Warner Bros., and the Potter fan community. At Warner Bros., J.D. worked extensively with Wizarding World.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/yBceGEt.png)\n\nAdditional opportunities will involve working with existing IP holders, creative, tech, and performative talent, and the institutions across J.D.’s network. \n\nJ.D. will serve as a Nouns educator, evangelist, and facilitator in both his network and the traditional media, entertainment, and marketing industries.

We have built a tool that’s tailor-made to help execute these trades: *TWAMM.* The trade will be executed completely on-chain, transparently with very low fees and minimal gas costs.\n\n## **Background**\nTWAMM is a concept introduced by [Paradigm](https://www.paradigm.xyz/2021/07/twamm) in July 2021. *\"It works by breaking long-term orders into infinitely many infinitely small pieces and executing them against an embedded constant-product AMM smoothly over time.\"*\n\nAn on-chain AMM protocol to enable large token swap is essential to increase DeFi adoption and anti-fragility. Some interesting use cases for TWAMMs include [treasury diversification](https://twitter.com/HelloShreyas/status/1502177286170185735)*,* [whale liquidations](https://twitter.com/solendprotocol/status/1538553654575214592)*,* [peg maintenance](https://www.notion.so/fd88cb37208d4b0f9abaca4e276f9ddd)*, etc*.\n\n## **Product Design & Incentives**\nWe have been researching and developing TWAMMs since November 2021 and recently launched our protocol: [announcement](https://twitter.com/cronfinance/status/1645802789006876672). The code has been audited by SpearbitDAO, open-sourced, and verified on Etherscan. There’s more detail on the protocol on our [docs page](https://docs.cronfi.com/twamm/).\n- AMM: we built our TWAMM as a custom pool on top of Balancer V2 Vaults given the *security, liquidity, flexibility, and gas advantages* of leveraging Balancer. Additionally, Balancer has become a Schelling point for protocols that want to leverage their AMM, thus creating network effects & composability advantages.\n- Traders: as a long-term trader (Nouns DAO), you only have to pay gas for starting, canceling, or withdrawing proceeds from your order. All the other sub-orders of the DCA are done virtually and cost the Nouns DAO no gas fees. Virtual orders are only written on-chain when the next user interacts with the protocol (generally an arbitrageur).\n- Arbitrageurs: as seen on other AMMs like Uniswap, arbitrageurs are important to keep the price of the assets in line with external venues. Arbitrageurs are critical for TWAMMs because trade sizes are significantly larger and last for multiple blocks. Therefore we partnered with dedicated arbitrageurs (BloXRoute) to ensure pools are frequently arbitraged thus giving you a smooth fill.\n- Liquidity: Balancer already has over ***$131M*** in wstETH and ***$62M*** in rETH in the vault. We have successfully received a [liquidity + gauge](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-265-enable-wsteth-reth-gauge-ethereum/4643) to direct some of the liquidity to our TWAMM pool to provide the resting liquidity needed to execute this trade. TWAMMs are extremely capital efficient given that the trades are split across multiple blocks and arbitrageurs consistently bring new liquidity back to the system to correct price deviations.\n\n## **Advantages**\n- Low fees: wstETH/rETH is a stable pair and long-term swappers pay a one-time **0.03% fee.**\n- Fully on-chain: zero dependencies on off-chain services, oracles, compute etc.\n- Flexible: issue, change, and cancel orders with ease.\n    - Example new order: `sell 14_000 wstETH for rETH in 100_000 blocks` ~roughly 2 weeks\n    - Easy to use Gnosis Safe custom transaction UX\n- Full control of orders and assets: non-custodial, cancellable, and withdraw proceeds at any time.\n- Withdraw multiple times: users can withdraw once at the end, or every set number of blocks – they just pay gas fees.\n- DCA over 1000’s of blocks gas-free: Nouns DAO would only pay gas for starting and ending orders, and arbitrageurs pay for placing suborders on-chain.\n- Analytics: we will have an analytics dashboard that shows how the order is being filled so the DAO can monitor the trade.\n\n## **Risks & Mitigations**\nThe first trade will be for a relatively *small* amount of roughly 400 wstETH -> rETH to ensure TWAMM executes the trade as expected. Below are a few potential risks of the system and how we have and plan to mitigate them:\n- Smart contract:\n    - Fully audited: see SpearbitDAO report [here](https://github.com/spearbit/portfolio/blob/master/pdfs/CronFinance-Spearbit-Security-Review.pdf).\n    - Hack Risks: built on Balancer V2 Vaults which have been battle-tested for 2+ years.\n    - Bricked Pools: we’ve done extensive research and mitigations for gas, order DDoS, numerical underflows, incorrect TWAMM parameters etc – more info here: [0slippage](https://mirror.xyz/0slippage.eth).\n    - Loss of Funds: open-source code, audited, verified, non-custodial, users in full control of funds, trade happens over multiple blocks so it can be canceled at any time by the user.\n    - Malicious Pool Admin: all pool administrators can do is pause the pool or change fees at which point Nouns DAO can cancel and withdraw their funds.\n- Lack of Arbitrage: we have teamed up with BloXroute to provide dedicated arbitrage service. On the off chance neither service arbitrages the pool, the open market will arbitrage the pool.\n- Poor Execution: orders are cancellable at any time i.e if the price escapes preferred bounds restart the order at another time. Also, DCA is generally a better strategy than spot purchase for large orders.\n  - Monitoring: we will be actively monitoring the trade as the `delegate` to ensure the order is being filled at an optimal price. In case the trade escapes the optimal threshold, we will cancel the trade on behalf of the DAO and proceeds will be refunded to the Nouns DAO wallet.\n- Information Leakage: this is not a big concern for a stable pair like wstETH/rETH which are like assets and have deep liquidity pools.\n- MEV/Sandwich Attacks: orders are broken into small pieces and thus the benefit of front/back running orders is minimal – see the Paradigm paper for further details.\n\n## **Competition**\n\nHere are the alternatives and how they stack up against TWAMM. Note this isn’t a comprehensive list, but a short summary.\n\n- Gnosis Auction:\n    - Pros: well-tested technology\n    - Cons: reliant on well-funded keepers, minimum buy lots, price upside capped, infrastructure overhead, limited timeframe, poor execution vs DCA over long periods.\n- Manual DCA:\n    - Pros: can execute it today\n    - Cons: need to write a smart contract or fat finger mistakes, fees for each sub-order, gas costs of sub-orders, limited # of sub-orders\n- DEX/Aggregators:\n    - Pros: complete trade in a single block\n    - Cons: slippage, MEV attack vectors\n- OTC:\n    - Pros: limit orders and other novel trade execution algorithms\n    - Cons: off-chain, opaque, high fees, custodial, KYC, regulations, etc","proposer":"0x29c5dad7E34d0A27d6F65a0A7E07E4d03Dcd68c8","startBlock":17163230,"endBlock":17199230,"executed":false},"votes":[]},{"prop":{"id":276,"description":"# Nounish Playground - The Game\n\n# Nounish Playground - The Game\n\n## TL;DR:\nWe're proposing to build a mobile platformer game with 700 levels in which we introduce players to nounish concepts and educate them on Nouns DAO and adjacent extensions while playing through fun and engaging maps. While the total budget required to complete the game development is $200,000, we are seeking funding of **$90,000** for the alpha version, which will include an **early access** release. The alpha version is expected to take 6 months to complete, followed by an additional 6 months until the final release. Once the alpha version is released, we will require the remaining budget to complete the development of the game.\n\n---\n\n## Description\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/egqCNYh.jpg)\n\n**Click on the image to view the proposed game design.**\n\n[![](https://i.imgur.com/j38RqEz.jpg)\n](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toY9TC21gyQ)\n\n\n---\n### The game is divided into two parts:\n- Single Player\n- Multiplayer\n\n### Single Player\nThe single-player mode is a platformer game.\n\nIn this mode the player controls their noun to reach its destination - to be minted and sent to auction at **Nouns DAO**.\n\nThere is a unique level for each noun minted, designed with various obstacles and challenges.\n\nWe as a nounish family are waiting every day to see what the next noun will look like and how much the winning bid is at the auction for the previous noun, but we don't know anything about each noun’s background story. We don't know what a noun has been through before it gets minted! This concept was the inspiration for this game.\n\n### Getting to know **Nounish culture**\n\nSome stages of the game are designed to indirectly teach players about the Nounish culture and the **NounsDAO** mechanism. Players will be enticed to go through these stages in order to obtain valuable rewards, and in the process, they will come across learning opportunities to grasp these concepts. We believe that direct teaching of these concepts might not be engaging for players, so we aim to make the learning experience more fun and interactive through gameplay.\n\n**Click on the picture below to see the video**👇\n\n[![](https://i.imgur.com/GjT0Tiw.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lclo8l3t_g)\n\n#### Gameplay\nThe player controls their noun throughout each level in a 3D playground. Nouns can run, jump, grab, climb, dive + more to overcome the obstacles until the final point is reached and the noun goes through the gate to get minted.\n\nThere is ether on the path that the player must collect to meet the goal. The goal amount of ether is set based on how much that noun sold for at auction.\n\nAfter completing each level, the player is awarded three stars. The first star is just for completing the level and the second one is awarded if the count of collected ether has reached the winning bid amount and the last star is awarded based on the time spent completing the level.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/wgcyHFh.gif)\n\n\nFor example: The first level is about Noun 1 being minted and the player will have to guide the noun through the course while collecting enough ether to meet the winning bid on that noun, while trying to do it in the fastest time possible.\n\n**Click on the pictures below to watch an example of the Noun 1 & 2 levels of the game 👇**\n\n[![](https://i.imgur.com/b8ymd4i.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xz-ouU8xErE)\n\n[![](https://i.imgur.com/06KwPXg.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YxpdSb2iYo)\n\n### Multiplayer\nIn this mode of the game, players enter a battle royal like Fall Guys and compete with one another.\n\nEach session starts with 40 players and three matches are held in each session. At the end of each match, only half of the players walk it through, then at the end of the third match, the final player wins the match.\n\nThe game and environment design is nounish and each level/match has its own unique theme based on nounish extensions such as lil nouns, Gnars DAO, Alps DAO, and many others where spectators are members of these communities.\n\nIn multiplayer mode, we’ll hold monthly in-game events relevant to DAO news, events, and popular holidays.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/h41ZJ6O.png)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/UkWHRQ5.png)\nWe aim to differentiate our game from competitors by improving the user experience and providing creative ideas, attractive maps, and Nouns that engage players in exciting challenges. Ultimately, our focus is on delivering a flawless and engaging game experience, and continuously improving it to create a supportive and enjoyable experience for players.\n![](https://i.imgur.com/aaNzoDt.png)\nAfter the full release of the game, we plan to hold various competitions, ranging from seasonal events to in-game events and those related to important events in the NounsDAO community. By offering special Nouns-related prizes, our goal is to create more challenges for players and familiarize them with DAOs and NFTs. Additionally, we can hold custom events upon the request of NounsDAO.\n![](https://i.imgur.com/r4In8Ph.png)\nWe aim to reach **25,000** downloads in the first month after the game's release, and strive to achieve a steady growth rate of **5%** in monthly downloads. We intend to encourage players to engage in the single-player mode and invite their friends to play the multiplayer mode.\n![](https://i.imgur.com/JV5rG3L.png)\nWe incentivize players to invite their friends to play the game by offering rewards. Additionally, we create private clones for players to have a space to discuss the game.\n\n---\n\n## Why a Mobile Game?\nMobile games are easily available to everyone with a smartphone these days and have a wide audience range.\n![](https://i.imgur.com/5n5Er5H.jpg)\n\n---\n\n## Nouns DAO community?\n\nGiven the importance of the Nouns DAO community to our game, we have decided to leverage the collaboration with its members by inviting them to contribute ideas, feedback, and even resources to the game. This action will help foster a sense of ownership and strengthen the connection between our game and the community, ultimately ensuring its success.\nIn addition to inviting Nouns DAO members to collaborate on the game, we have decided to launch a Discord channel to share the game's production stages with the Nouns community. This channel will serve as a communication space for receiving ideas, feedback, and criticism from Nouns community members, as well as a place to showcase the game's development stages and updates to them. By doing so, we can listen to user feedback more effectively and make the best decisions for the game in sync with the community.\n\n---\n\n## How Long Will It Take To Produce?\n\nThe early access version will be released after 6 months and then it will take 6 months more until the final release.\n![](https://i.imgur.com/vV3NDUV.jpg)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/6vUzwGF.png)\n\n---\n\nYou've seen and love our work with the nounish music videos we've created, let's make a game with even more impact!\n\n---\n\n## Marketing\n- App Store Optimization (ASO): This gives maximum exposure to our game in the store by lowering our cost per install (CPI) and filtering high-value users. It all needs to have localized content (Keywords, Categories, Screenshots, and Video Trailers) per region and culture. This is a full-time job of a user acquisition manager excluding producing visual content.\n- Landing page: This is a one-page website where customers can learn more about our game. The landing page includes links to the App Store and Google Play Store, promo videos, a call-to-action, screenshots, gameplay trailers and reviews.\n- Running paid Youtube and social media ads: Targeted ads on social media platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, or Twitter. These platforms allow us to reach specific audiences based on factors such as demographics, interests, and behaviors.(The cost will be optimized by ASO)\n- Offering incentives for referrals: Encourage existing players to share the game with their friends by offering rewards or incentives for referrals.\n- Influencer marketing: Partnering with social media influencers or YouTubers who have a relevant audience can be an effective way to generate buzz and interest in the game. The budget could be used to compensate these influencers for promoting the game on their channels.\n----\n\n## Monetization\n- In-app purchases: Our game will offer a variety of ways for players to make in-app purchases to enhance their gaming experience and generate revenue for the game.\n  - In-Game Items: Players can purchase in-game items such as currency, power-ups, and other bonuses to improve their gameplay.\n  - Battle Passes: Players can purchase a Battle Pass to unlock new game modes, competitions, and exclusive rewards for a limited time. This popular monetization strategy creates a sense of urgency and excitement for players, increasing engagement and revenue for the game.\n  - (By offering these in-app purchases, we can provide players with new and exciting ways to engage with the game while generating revenue for the project.)\n- Sponsorship or Brand Partnerships: Collaborating with a brand to promote their product or service within the game. This can generate revenue without relying solely on in-app purchases.\n- Crowdfunding: As part of our monetization plan, we will be leveraging the power of NFTs to offer a unique crowdfunding option for our game. By purchasing an NFT from us, supporters will not only be helping to fund the development of our game, but they will also receive exclusive in-game items and benefits.\n\nThe NFTs purchased through our crowdfunding campaign will be useable within the game as character skins, attachments, and other in-game items. This provides a unique and exciting opportunity for our supporters to be part of the game's development and to have a tangible stake in its success.\n\nAdditionally, these NFTs can be traded on secondary markets, creating a potential revenue stream for our supporters and adding to the game's overall ecosystem. We believe that this innovative use of NFTs in crowdfunding will not only benefit our game's development, but also provide a new way for people to support and engage with the project.\n\n\n----\n\n\n## Who Are We?\nThe **[Genius Slackers](https://geniusslackers.com/)** team is an independent producer of video games.

By leveraging these strategies, our game will not only provide players with a fun and engaging experience, but it will also introduce them to the exciting world of Nouns DAO and cryptocurrency.\n\nThrough our ASO, paid ads, and referral incentives, we aim to reach a wide audience and drive downloads. Our monetization plan includes in-app purchases, battle passes, brand partnerships, and innovative NFT-based crowdfunding that will allow supporters to contribute to the game's development while receiving exclusive in-game items and benefits.\n\nWith all of the game's content being open-source and available to the public, we are committed to continually updating and expanding the game over time. By voting for our proposal, you are supporting a game that is not only entertaining and engaging but also pushing the boundaries of gaming and crypto.\n\n---\n\n## Game Engine\nWith **Unreal Engine 5**, we have access to a variety of powerful web3 plugins that enable us to seamlessly integrate blockchain and NFT features into our upcoming mobile platformer game. We're excited to leverage the engine's capabilities to create an immersive and innovative gaming experience for our players.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/mub7e3k.png)\n\n---\n\n## Measuring Success\nWe will be able to measure success in a number of ways including, but not limited to:\n- analytics on game installs/downloads\n- daily active users\n- call to action clicks\n- landing page metrics\n- social media engagement and analytics\n\n---\n\n### Thank you for your consideration!

While I appreciate the effort and initiative behind this proposal, I'm skeptical about its ability to make a significant impact.\n\nHowever, beyond all of that the REAL deal-breaker for me is the proposed monetization strategies. In-app purchases and crowdfunding mechanics may work for some games, but I believe they miss the mark for the Nouns community. If the goal is to proliferate the Nouns meme, a DAO-funded game should be free to play, and the focus should be on creating an engaging, memorable experience that leaves players wanting to learn more about Nouns, not spending a few dollars on micro-transactions.\n\nIt's important to remember that successful games with an emphasis on multiplayer are built on communities and sustained by passionate players. If the proposed game fails to create an experience that resonates with the a wider audience, it has no real purpose.

Is this public good something that other organizations won’t fund, or that Nouns is uniquely best to fund?\n\nThis game, while potentially enjoyable art, is not a public good. It is not CC0 or freely licensed, and it can't be easily remixed by other Nouns supporters.\n\nIt is a business that may be successful and sustainable in its own right. That is excellent! There are many great venues for funding this, from venture capital to grants programs within the games industry to crowdfunding. The authors themselves point to crowdfunding as a potential option for fundraising for this game. But since there are many potential funding sources outside of Nouns, I don't believe that Nouns should find this.\n\nAs a result, I don't believe that this proposal is something that Nouns is uniquely suited to fund. I agree with Jihad that retroactive funding could be appropriate if this benefits Nouns, but I don't believe that Nouns should kickstart this. I would also reconsider this if the game were freely licensed and provided a building block for others to make Nounish games too.

This is an opportunity to create a low-cost, yet highly sought after and unique piece of hardware that fits in your pocket and carried daily with you. From conversation starters in person to unboxings and showing off on social media, this device is sleek, a standout, and an instant proliferator.\n\n[![NOUNS-PROP-GIF.gif](https://i.postimg.cc/d3NKdZM3/NOUNS-PROP-GIF.gif)](https://postimg.cc/y3R5Cd8C)\n\nMy speciality is creating exceptional and memorable digital and physical experiences through a variety of mediums (i.e. installations, hardware, web, 3D, etc.) working with notable brands such as my ongoing partnerships with Arduino; building conceptual prototypes, fashion brands such as Christopher Kane and Selfridges, and most recently, creating an [exclusive audio-reactive hardware for Zora](https://twitter.com/____zine____/status/1651233581723779078?s=20) (under [Lychee, Inc](https://lychee.vision/) - company I cofounded).\n\nWith 58k followers across my socials where 90% are avid hardware enthusiasts, there’s an exciting opportunity to introduce and build a new branch of applicability to Nouns via the Noggles LED hardware device and its CC0 files, giving them a new tool to develop firmware, create physical nounish projects and iterate further.\n\nExplorer Grants has led me here and I think there’s a lot more that Nouns and I can do together to create beautiful nounish objects, art pieces, experiences and more! Having a shared vision to build in the public domain; to open source for more creativity, collaboration and innovation – I think by embracing Nouns and my unique pov as an artist, we can produce captivating nounish creations that showcase the best of both our perspectives and amplify our collective creativity. To leave not only lasting impressions, but the foundational blocks to build upon further and allow other people’s creativity to flourish!\n\n---\n\n## TLDR\n\n- Requesting 75Ξ (across 6 months with *__~18.5% return__* if all units sold):\n    - **Fund the development and production of 600 Artisanal Noggles LED keychains**\n        - 50 units of Supply to the DAO + 100% Profit / Mint Revenue to the DAO\n        - 50 units used for gifting, raffles, etc. → for marketing purposes\n        - 500 units available to mint / purchase *__for 0.025ETH__*\n        - Costs for building hardware, prototypes, designing enclosure, packaging, firmware dev and liaising with manufacturers to source production deals with suppliers\n        - Build Website to purchase: front-end & back-end with custom NFT + smart contract\n            - include all open-source files and development of the 6 nounish projects I’ve made during Explorer Grants\n    - **Marketing → via my socials [@tigrisli](https://www.tiktok.com/@tigrisli)**\n        - Create TikTok / Reel content with “making of video” and “how to make”\n        - High distribution → potential of reaching *+100,000 viewers from my socials*\n        - My audience: *90% hardware enthusiasts and creative engineers (direct marketing + distribution)*\n            - Show hardware enthusiasts and DIY electronics builders that they can build with Nouns, embody the brand’s identity and fuel their own creativity, *with Nouns!*\n                - Bring new applicability of Nouns to hardware engineers → developing nounish hardware and firmware\n        - [My Media Kit](https://files.cargocollective.com/c1344327/TIGRIS-MediaKit.pdf) - Overall Stats:\n            - **Total Followers: 58k**\n            - **Total Video Views: 10.7M**\n            - **Engagement Rate: 39.9%**\n    - CC0 everything → code, hardware, schematics will be open-sourced so anyone is able to reproduce the keychain themselves → all files will be available in public domain\n\n---\n\n## Proposal\n\nI was first funded by Explorer Grants ([prop 178](https://nouns.wtf/vote/178)) and took the opportunity to create 6 experimental hardware pieces: [a Nouns Governance Wallet](https://twitter.com/tigrisli/status/1631322679172112384?s=20), [USB E-Ink Displaying Daily Nouns & Props](https://twitter.com/tigrisli/status/1625883686561275905?s=20), [Etch-A-Sketch](https://twitter.com/tigrisli/status/1624120919152001040?s=20), [Noggles LED Keychain](https://twitter.com/tigrisli/status/1645788540499025920?s=20), [Noggles Speakers](https://twitter.com/tigrisli/status/1637133435549495297?s=20), and the [Nouns Camera](https://twitter.com/tigrisli/status/1646167941178703872?s=20).\n\nOne of these objects stood apart from the rest and got a lot of attention on Twitter. The desire to own a unique Noggles LED Keychain led me directly to create this proposal.\n\nNouns has the opportunity to lead the way in creating unique hardware-based artwork that many people want to own; setting new standards for innovation and creativity, that aren’t only visually stunning by highly coveted by collectors and enthusiasts alike.\n\nWith my strong social presence and commitment to open-source content, I believe I can help reinforce the Nouns brand beyond crypto. Directly through my own brand; in addition of building conceptual hardware and art installations I document videos of those builds that reach over 58,000 followers and have amassed a combined total of +10.7 million video views with a 39.9% engagement rate.\n\n**Why the Noggles LED Keychain?**\n\n- Daily-carry item, it’s an effective means of promoting Nouns and serves as an important signifier and physical representation of the Nouns identity. Its power is in its subtle daily constant that’s unavoidably carried everywhere - making it a strong means of connecting people with the Nouns community.\n- *Daily signifier → instant proliferator*\n- Affordability → low costs\n    - Estimated purchase price: ~$50 (0.025Ξ)\n\n**Hardware Specs:**\n- Array of 78 RGB LEDs\n- Customized pattern animations (firmware)\n- Button to alternate between the patterns\n- Rechargeable lithium battery via USB-C\n\n[![LED-KEYCHAIN.gif](https://i.postimg.cc/GmhydZKj/LED-KEYCHAIN.gif)](https://postimg.cc/gnQJKtfw)\n\n---\n\n# Who **For?**\nI have a high niche community of hardware enthusiasts (Instagram + TikTok) and people in Crypto (Twitter) – I think these Noggle LED Keychains will perfectly hit both demographics, especially as it will all be open-source.\n\n- **Nouners + Nouns Community**\n    - this is an artisanal nounish object, a beautifully designed novelty item\n    - a tangible semiotic Nouns device that you can carry with you daily and fits in the palm of one’s hand\n    - direct symbol and “show” of being part of the Nouns community\n- **Hardware Enthusiasts**\n    - Typical RGB LED add-ons for Arduino / Raspberry Pi can cost upwards of $50, but the Noggles LED Keychain offers an affordable alternative with a programmable ATTINY85 chip and x78 compact RGB LEDs\n    - Designed with CC0 and for hacking / tinkering, Noggles LEDs provide hardware enthusiasts the opportunity to evolve the code and proliferate Nouns by applying it to their own projects, including larger hardware projects such as IoT and the application of sensors.\n        - new applicability of Nouns → developing nounish firmware\n    - Show hardware enthusiasts and DIY electronics builders that they can build with Nouns, embody the brand’s identity and fuel their own creativity, *with Nouns*\n    - Hardware builders and creative engineers are well-positioned to explore exciting possibilities of crypto, but haven’t been shown ways of getting involved. I think with the Noggles LED Keychain (and other Nounish hardware) we can bridge this gap and show them what’s possible!\n    - ******3D Printing Enthusiasts / Product Designers (sub-group typically part of hardware builders)******\n        - CC0 enclosure files enables engineers and designers to create their own unique versions of the Noggles enclosure with a variety of materials and customizing it to their liking\n        - This opens up new opportunities for creative evolution, allowing engineers to physically make their own nounish objects and explore new design possibilities\n\nThe proposal includes the development to build, design and prototype the ***Noggles LED Keychain*** with a production run of 600 units- working with manufacturers and liaising with suppliers to meet industry standards and construct the PCB circuit from scratch, complete with a custom software and firmware that will be open-sourced, and a designed enclosure with custom packaging - all to go into production with a custom website for purchasing.\n\nTo bring the **Noggles LED Keychain** to market, the project will be divided into 6 stages over a 6 month period, with a total cost of 75Ξ to cover production, design costs, prototyping iterations, hardware components, material costs, material sourcing, labour, etc.\n\n---\n\n## **An overview of the steps to build the Noggles LED Keychain**\n\n1. **PCB Circuit Design**: This involves R&D for components, block diagrams, MCUs, preliminary design, schematic design, and PCB layout design.

Many people on Twitter are minting and tweeting about it to signal solidarity. The mint amount leaderboard has become a sort of signaling contest, with the top 8 currently \n\n- kames.eth • 2024 items\n- context.app • 2000 items\n- zapper.eth • 1200 items\n- rk6.eth • 1200 items\n- m.jesse.xyz • 1100 items\n- moonwelldefi.eth • 1000 items\n- kevin0x4a.eth • 1000 items\n- villagechief.eth • 300 items\n\nWe are proposing\n1. Nouns DAO attempt to claim the top spot on the leaderboard by minting 5k of the \"Stand with Crypto\" NFT.\n2. Nouns DAO donate 55 ETH–$103k at time of writing–to the Gitcoin Crypto Advocacy round, doubling the current matching grant. (Funds will be sent to the [Gitcoin multisig](https://etherscan.io/address/0xde21F729137C5Af1b01d73aF1dC21eFfa2B8a0d6).) \n\nNote, the Gitcoin round will be concluded by the time this proposal could be executed, but we have been in touch with the Gitcoin team and they are happy to make it work: payouts will happen with some delay after the round is over, so our funds can easily be added to the matching pool. (The matching funds will be allocated at the end of the round to the grantees based on the level of support they all received during the round. More details on matching [here](https://wtfisqf.com/?grant=&grant=&grant=&grant=&match=1000).)\n\n## Why \n- Because it is a good thing to do: It is a crucial time for crypto, from a regulatory perspective. The work being done by the organizations in this Gitcoin round is important and we all benefit from it. We also help by signaling our support and raising awareness of the effort. \n- Because it is Nounish: we see generosity and funding things that benefit the crypto community, at large, as core Nounish values. \n- Because it is good for Nouns DAO: giving money to support crypto helps us build good will in the crypto community and attract community members who want to buy a Noun, or join the community generally, because they want to be a part of supporting similar work. There is also significant attention on this mint right now, and the mint amount \"leaderboard,\" and we see this as a unique timely marketing opportunity. \n\nThanks for your time :) ","proposer":"0xbc3ed6B537f2980e66f396Fe14210A56ba3f72C4","startBlock":17173962,"endBlock":17209962,"executed":true},"votes":[{"support":1,"voter":"0xA86882277E69FbF0a51805cdc8b0a3a113079E63","numberOfVotes":2,"reason":"https://twitter.com/krel404/status/1652776736734474240?s=46&t=HMDCibI3Hl5luKRaTagiHA"},{"support":1,"voter":"0x3Cbd57dA2F08b3268da07E5C9038C11861828637","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":"My thesis as a delegate is: “Nouns has a unique role in the ecosystem as a gathering place around public goods.”\n\nFunding crypto regulatory advocacy is an excellent example of a public good. It is something that benefits the entire ecosystem, and it is something that many groups won’t fund. This funding is especially powerful coming from a more neutral organization like Nouns. Advocacy from VC funds and companies is excellent and their work is incredibly important, but Nouns serves a special role by decoupling its advocacy from direct financial interests. This advocacy also benefits Nouns and other DAOs, which lack significant amounts of regulatory clarity.\n\nI understand concerns by Scott and others that regulatory advocacy is off-mission (https://twitter.com/scott_lew_is/status/1652699651265503233). Those concerns are thoughtful, and I agree that Nouns is not and should not be an advocacy organization for regulatory change. At the same time, I draw a strong distinction between funding advocacy and directly participating in advocacy. Funding advocacy in my mind is on-mission as a public good, but participating in advocacy is likely something that the existing advocacy groups can do far better than Nouns. As long as Nouns sticks to funding only, advocacy can be an effective public good.\n\nThat being said, I wish this proposal was stronger in its advocacy for Nouns PR. In my opinion, Nouns is not aggressive enough in advertising its donations, and that hinders it from attracting people and acting as a beacon for public goods. Claiming the top spot on the leaderboard is a good start, but I wish the proposal went further on advocating for Nouns publicity. A few things that I wish were addressed in the proposal:\n1. Nouns would be putting up 50% of the funding for the crypto advocacy round (Coinbase put up the other $100K, with the rest being direct donations from users), but the description on the Gitcoin Grants Round only states that  “Coinbase is on a mission to advocate for digital asset policies here in the United States, and this crypto advocacy round will support the amazing organizations who are leading the charge.” I would love a commitment from Coinbase and/or Gitcoin to include Nouns in the description of the advocacy round if this proposal passes. Coinbase, Gitcoin, and Nouns are stronger together! This is a collaboration I’d love to see.\n2. I wish that Nouns had suggestions on how the advocacy organizations that will benefit from the matching funds could collaborate with Nouns. These don’t need to be requirements, merely suggestions. For example, welcoming advocacy organizations and their members to participate in the Nouns Playground and set a Nouns from the Playground as their PFP would set a nice norm, whether or not those groups choose to adopt it. (I also recognize that in this case, the amount is on the smaller side for that kind of PR.)\n3. The history of the Shield emoji and Coinbase is something that I wish the proposal clearly discussed. It’s worth noting that the Shield emoji is repurposed from the “Coinbase FUD protection squad” (https://twitter.com/lay2000lbs/status/1551956224232628224) and was previously used by Coinbase employees and supporters to signal support for Coinbase as a company. While there are only so many shield emoji available, it is relevant for Nouns voters to know that they’re participating in an initiative that is repurposing symbols that supported Coinbase as symbols to support the industry. I am perfectly fine with this, but the history is relevant as Nouns thinks about how much it benefits from branding here.\n\nIn short, while Nouns could do more to advocate for itself and get stronger PR benefits from this, I am in support of this proposal. Funding regulatory advocacy is a public good that benefits the ecosystem, and I believe it matches Nouns’s mission as long as Nouns sticks to funding only."},{"support":0,"voter":"0x00cDa37BfC3Dd20349Aa901Fe8646688218d8772","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x2666f0C8FB58d182f2Dd79475DCA4A07B3724607","numberOfVotes":3,"reason":"Pump it!"},{"support":1,"voter":"0x8ac3ecf6973E020cC0E6e8989Fb71B4a77D65987","numberOfVotes":2,"reason":"Taken from my newsletter Active Governance: https://paragraph.xyz/@thebower/UF6pmJQChyRthUTsBfq7\n\nI like the idea of having Nouns attached to important initiatives in the crypto community.

He remains an ethOS co-founder. [@markus](https://warpcast.com/markus) (mhaas.eth, https://nf.td/markus)  is also a co-founder and leads development for ethOS. Team ethOS consists of multiple founders, YC Alum, and members with significant Web3 industry experience.\n\nOur website: [ethosmobile.org](https://ethosmobile.org)\n\n![EthOS Render](https://i.ibb.co/wsP4cTC/Clean-Shot-2023-04-27-at-20-51-41-2x.png)\n\n### **Why are we building ethOS?**\n\nEthereum on mobile is nerfed by gatekeepers. Most consumer internet activity occurs on mobile devices. However, Android and iOS treat Ethereum as just another application, rather than the protocol that underpins Web3. For example, the iOS OpenSea app doesn’t let you buy, sell, or even _send_ NFTs, because [Apple wants a cut of Ethereum gas fees.](https://fortune.com/crypto/2022/12/01/coinbase-apple-30-percent-fee-digital-wallet/) Uniswap has created an iOS wallet that Apple didn’t approve for months, and [they don’t know why](https://twitter.com/Uniswap/status/1631691337845075968). Furthermore, the Web3 user experience is terrible. Using Ethereum dapps on mobile means browsing within a wallet, and bouncing back and forth between the wallet and the web app. This also prevents new interaction models (such as pay-as-you-stream streaming for audio NFTs). [Apple also does not allow token-gated features](https://decrypt.co/112804/apple-clarifies-app-store-rules-barring-nft-utility-external-purchase-links). Android and iOS are permissioned platforms by design, and this hinders Web3 development. By offering a meaningful alternative, we can push these companies to adopt Ethereum, or lose market share.\n\nethOS fully embraces Ethereum to unlock the full potential of Web3. ethOS features an onboard Ethereum light node and a System level wallet, allowing for direct interaction between mobile applications and Ethereum, and giving users more security and control over their assets. Unlike iOS and Android, ethOS doesn’t own the App Store. In the spirit of Web3, ethOS supports competition and composability among apps services.\n\n### **Where are we at?**\n\nWe launched ethOS v2.0 at ETH Denver 2023, and released ethOS v2.1 last month. We have been building continuously since December 2021. Despite not taking any funding, we maintain a rapid pace of development, and have a long list of exciting functionality and features to bring to ethOS. Some of the cool features of ethOS available today include:\n\n**Onboard light node**\n- No need for centralized RPC services pre-merge. Post-merge it gets data from a centralized RPC, but verifies the data using beaconchain data.\n- Less man-in-the-middle risk\n- Further decentralizes access to Ethereum in the future using the Portal Network\n\n**System-level wallet** \n - Approves transactions without leaving the browser or app\n - Removes the need for the centralized WalletConnect service\n\n**NFT minting from Gallery/Camera**\n - Create an NFT in seconds\n\n**XMTP messaging**\n - Decentralized messaging between Ethereum or ENS addresses\n\n**ENS integration**\n - Contacts leverage ENS\n\n**Private Key Management via Secure Enclave**\n - Private key is encrypted using symmetric key stored on SPU\n\n**Biometric signing of transactions**\n - Sign a transaction in-app or in-browser with your fingerprint, without having to switch over to the wallet\n\n**Android apps and Services**\n - Install all apps available in the Google Play Store and get traditional Google Play Services for your Android apps\n\n**Three Browser**\n - A full web browser integrated with the system wallet for seamless signing\n\nHere’s swapping on Uniswap on ethOS:\n[https://youtu.be/3PiMTGq3i-A](https://youtu.be/3PiMTGq3i-A)\n\nHere’s minting an NFT on ethOS:\n[https://youtu.be/edVpdWwq-6A](https://youtu.be/edVpdWwq-6A)\n\n### **The Purpose of this Proposal**\n\nThe purpose of this proposal is to ask for a grant that allows us to launch ethOS devices for anyone to purchase.\n\nCurrently, users have to jump through a lot of hoops to try out ethOS. We and our community have been building and testing ethOS on out-of-date devices (Pixel3, 3XL, and 5a). This has enabled us and our community to get devices at a low cost, but it is not a model for widespread adoption. To use ethOS today, users must find and buy used devices, and they must be OEM unlocked (many are incorrectly labeled). This is a major impediment to adoption.\n\nethOS is now ready for the Web3 community at large, and we are going to make it available pre-installed on current Pixel 7s. To make this happen, we must update ethOS to be compatible with Pixel 7s (a development lift), and establish a delightful sales and quality distribution process (orders on website, sourcing of devices, installation of ethOS, branding/boxing, and fulfillment). Most costs associated with achieving this are for sourcing devices, packing materials, shipping, laser-etching, and developer time.\n\nOur team has worked unpaid thus far; however, three of our developers will be transitioning to a paid status as we begin to sell and support a consumer-grade device. With full time engineers, we can build even faster, and better support the growing ethOS developer community.\n\nThis is an important time in the evolution of ethOS, and funding would greatly assist us in this transition.\n\n### **What’s in it for Nouns?**\n\nWe believe that building an open source, mobile operating system as a public good is a very Nounish goal. Everyone in the Ethereum ecosystem is aware of the negative effect that Apple and Google gate-keeping has on Web3 mobile. ethOS represents a critical effort to unlock the potential of Ethereum on mobile, and to increase Ethereum adoption.\n\nOur first ethOS device will also have a Nounish option! To thank Nouns for their support, purchasers of the ethOS phone can choose the Nounish Edition, which feature generative Nounish wallpaper, a Noggle-sporting ethOS logo etched on the back of their device, and Nounish packaging to deliver a delightful experience for the user. It will look something like this:\n\n![Nouns Edition](https://i.ibb.co/K5nNQKc/Clean-Shot-2023-04-27-at-21-08-46-2x.png)\n\nWe will also prominently thank Nouns for their support on our website and in our social channels for providing the necessary public goods funding for the first ethOS phone.\n\n### **Why we are submitting a Proposal**\n\nWe believe that ethOS can be supported in a Web3 native manner that is consistent with the goals of a free and open-source operating system that embraces Ethereum. We have not taken any venture funding to date for this reason. A grant from Nouns would greatly help us advance our mission at this critical time. Furthermore, support from Nouns would raise awareness for ethOS.\n\n### **The Ask and Deliverable**\nWe are asking for 40 eth (~ $76k) in funding delivered at 0x55A4E5123F8923500fF7AA97e75231a54A9c233a.\n\nWe will make the ethOS phone available for purchase in Summer 2023.\n\nThank you kindly for your consideration,\nTeam ethOS\n","proposer":"0x0B3CF56E7dF3BB3Fb7201fFcD96d279b05DDd2E3","startBlock":17177400,"endBlock":17213400,"executed":true},"votes":[{"support":1,"voter":"0xA86882277E69FbF0a51805cdc8b0a3a113079E63","numberOfVotes":2,"reason":"https://twitter.com/krel404/status/1653510860201947140?s=46&t=HMDCibI3Hl5luKRaTagiHA"},{"support":1,"voter":"0x3B60e31CFC48a9074CD5bEbb26C9EAa77650a43F","numberOfVotes":2,"reason":"I support this proposal as it aligns with Nouns' objective of promoting Public Goods and ethOS is one of the most ambitious attempts at a Public Good.

Much more likely that dominant crypto adoption comes through app diversity in established OS app stores, or via browser functionality within a web3 app (like what Metamask does today).\n \nNet: Positive - Despite the visible difficulties of new OS adoption, if anyone can help fund a run on a new system its Nouns DAO. The proposal seems very aligned with the DAO's overall goals of promoting the nounish meme alongside contributing to the long term development of the crypto ecosystem.

By onboarding and growing a community of developers at ETH global hackathons, we will be able to find the next 1,000 nouners\n- **[Proliferation]** By investing in technology and innovation NounsDAO will be able to take advantage of new proliferation opportunities. For example, we can bring Noun-Computers to **CES**, **ETH Hackathons**, and maybe even go to **Shark Tank** to raise additional investments.\n    - Partner with ETH global hackathons by providing Noun-Computers for hardware competitions\n    ![](https://i.imgur.com/YasYd13.png)\n    - Showcase Noun-Computers at CES, the most prestigious consumer electronics show\n    ![](https://i.imgur.com/Dhf4aCL.png)\n    - Raise additional capital from investors (Shark Tank etc) and put Noun-Computers into every school, university, and mall\n    ![](https://i.imgur.com/IGjeKq4.png)\n\n\n## Description\nI propose to grow a community of software and hardware developers around Noun-Computers and Noun-Breadbook (aka breadboard). Elegance, versatility, and performance are the three things that make a good single-board computer. Noun-Computers will be much more versatile and convenient than raspberry pi and arduino boards Noun-Computers will enable people to work on much bigger and more ambitious projects thanks to an innovative Noun-breadbook (a reinvented breadboard). The Breadbook is a new type of device that would replace outdated breadboards and allow developers to arrange software and hardware setups more cleanly and understandably. I propose to apply for a few patents and trademarks and later give everyone open access to the inventions if needed.\n\nThe Noun-Devices will be available in the $40-$60 price range and distributed strictly using a fixed price policy to ensure that the end users do not overpay. The money from sales will be used to further proliferate NounsDAO by introducing more devices, modules, books, and tutorials. All future products will be branded and aligned with the nounish culture.\n\nNounsDAO can **sponsor ETH Hackathons** by providing the first 400 Noun-Computer kits. Also, 30% of the supply will be allocated to **Nouns-Computer Fund** any nouner will be able to request computers for **Public Good** via an on-chain proposal and send it to developing countries, minority groups, or other purposes.\n\nWe can bring NounsDAO to **Consumer Electronic Show (CES**) where we will have an opportunity to talk with big companies and media outlets about how NounsDAO builds an internet government, growth a global community of talented people, enables multidisciplinary collaborations, and funds cool projects with a meaningful impact on the future such as Noun-Computers. We can show the world innovative devices that will be used at universities, schools, and indie projects around the world.\n\n## The problem\n![](https://i.imgur.com/g7sIhYL.png)\n\nHow can we reach new communities and establish a sustainable proliferation model for NounsDAO? My idea is to grow a community of software and hardware developers around new, affordable, and innovative Noun-Computers. Noun-Computers will win the hearts and minds of developers by improving the software and hardware prototyping experience.\n- **[Price and Availability]** Schools and universities do not use a single-board computer in their curriculum due to price inconsistency. For example, raspberry pi 4 boards are advertised to cost $70 but you are never able to buy them at that price. The market price for raspberry pi 4 is over $160. By manufacturing Noun-Computers, we can prevent any price speculations and make truly affordable and widely available single-board computers.\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Oqo5Ojb.png)\n\n- **[Versatility & Capability]** \nThe Noun-Computer and Noun-Breadbook would be very intuitive and easy to use. A well-selected combination of features, interfaces and elements placement on the board would allow to free the working space for other elements/modules. The Noun-Computers performance will be enough to run ETH staking node, run deep learning and computer vision applications. The Noun-Computer will be a size of a credit card that can work as a stand-alone device or with a Noun-Breadbook. We are going to fit the following features:\n    - AM62Ax Sitara, Arm Cortex-A53 1.4 GHz\n    - M.2 ports x2 for SSD, GPS modules expansion\n    - MicroSD x1\n    - Bluetooth & WiFi\n    - Ethernet\n    - 40-pin GPIO Header\n    - USB-C x3 for power, tethered connection, peripherals, monitor, etc\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/R0Ol8Uo.png)\n- **[Aesthetic]** Existing single-board computers use ports and dongles (HDMI, ethernet, USB) that raise the cost, limit portability, and result in bad aesthetics. Custom simple boards (microcontroller based) give you better aesthetics but limited functionality. Likewise, Custom Systems (CPU based) would have good aesthetics and capability but are too expensive to design for individuals. Noun-Computers would allow greater flexibility in developing tidy electronic prototypes with custom expansion boards that feature USB-C ports, plug-in card connectors, and digital pins. Below is an image of breadboard-based setups. One of the core problems is that the breadboard-based prototyping setups are not portable, clumsy, and difficult to keep in one piece hence you can't work on your great ideas from a coffee shop or take your work to a class. Likewise, it is hard to use breadboard-based projects to explain your software and hardware ideas in a concise, precise, and understandable manner. The breadboard was invented back in the 1880s and there was no innovation in the breadboard design in the past 143 years! ([\"Electrical Switch board\"](https://patents.google.com/patent/US231708A)).\n![](https://i.imgur.com/4PX7sxT.png)\n\n## Noun-Computer\n![](https://i.imgur.com/wMkKAC9.png)\nNoun-Computer and Noun-Breadbook are new devices that provide a foundation for inexpensive software and hardware prototyping. Noun-Devices will enable any developer to build clean, portable, and good-looking hardware prototypes that work. We will be able to reach and educate millions of developers around the globe and build nounish dev communities. With Noun-Computers, NounsDAO will win the hearts and minds of developers. All the devices will be designed to be best in performance, price, and user experience categories.\n\nThe Noun-Computer will compete in performance and price with raspberry pi and arduino boards. The devices will be sold via a fixed price policy to ensure that end users do not overpay.\nThe Noun-Devices will cost $40-$60. Similar devices on the market are advertised as cheap but usually sold for $100~$160. The money from sales will be used to introduce more nounish devices, books, tutorials, and sponsor eth hackathons.\n\nAll documentation, tutorials, and books will use nouns assets as well as electrical components on the computer boards will be arranged in the form of noggles.\n\n## Noun-Breadbook\nNoun-Computer and Noun-Breadbook are new devices that work together and provide a fundamentally new way to work on software and hardware projects. Noun-Breadbook is a reinvented breadboard and my original idea and I would love to work with NounsDAO to bring this game-changing device to life. The key to success is to make Noun-Computer and Noun-Breadbook complement each other and work together as one modular system. I believe that Noun-Devices will be widely accepted at universities, schools, startups, and indie dev. It is an expensive project but has a great return on investment and will be a sustainable way to proliferate NounsDAO. We can put Nouns to [Consumer Electronic Show](https://www.ces.tech/) in Las Vegas and generate a lot of positive exposure to NounDAO through press and tv.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/MMmpIQq.png)\nThe Noun-Breadbook will replace old breadboards allowing easy connection of modules to a Noun-Computer. The pages will be available in different configurations that would increase the versatility of the whole system. The breadbook binder will be made from aluminum. The main function of the binder is to connect pages, supply power, and connect the board to ports such as HDMI, USB-C, and AUDIO.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/USOoae5.png)\nThe pages of the Noun-Breadbook would be assembled from layers of paper, encapsulation, cathode, and anode. The pages are going to provide a base for soldering components. The pages will be flexible and made using technology used in the production of flexible displays. The Noun-Breadbook will be lightweight and flexible to enable compact design and portability.\n\nI have been working in academia for a long time and know that new devices such as Noun-Computer and Noun-Breadbook would significantly improve user experience and inspire people to work on bigger and more ambitious projects.\n\n## Using Noun-Breadbook as an interactive textbook\nAn interactive book based on Noun-Breadbook will be the most nounish book in academia, period! The design of Noun-Computer and Breadbook would allow people to work on creative projects. For example, users will be able to use blank pages to document their work and development progress. Likewise, users will be able to share their work by sharing printable breadbooks. Noun-Computer and Noun-Breadbook would be appreciated by universities and schools around the globe. It is also possible that in the future the Breadbook would be adopted as a learning platform by Computer Science and Engineering schools.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/fr00zAZ.jpg)\nHere are the photos of how the Noun-Computer and Noun-breadbook would enhance user experience.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Nhe3Hz3.jpg)\nThe pages can be used to give instructions to a user.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/lFKpnUB.jpg)\nI will write a book with five complete tutorials that will teach how to develop applications for cameras, graphics, networks, I/O interfaces, and servo controllers. For example, a Camera Lab would like something like this where you can learn everything you need to know to develop applications from scratch. In this Lab, you will learn about the implementation and design patterns of camera applications. For example: take photos and videos; object/face tracking; mapping environment\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/0yUM0xL.jpg)\nThis Lab will teach you everything you need to know to program computer graphics from scratch. In this Lab, you will learn about the implementation and design patterns of beautiful UI and animations.\n\n## Deliverables\n- Sponsor ETH Hackathons, and provide 400 Noun-Computer kits for competitions\n- Donate 30% of supply to developing countries and minority groups\n- Photo & Video report every month on the state of the progress\n- Invention patents (to be released for open access)\n- Booths at Consumer Electronic Show & Mobile World Congress\n- Guest Lectures at 20 Universities around the globe\n- A Noun-Computer will be available in the $40-$60 price range\n- A Blank Noun-Breadbook will be available in the $50-$70 price range\n- An Interactive Noun-Breadbook will be available in the $90 - $130 price range\n\nThe money from sales of the devices will be used to support future development and manufacturing.\n\n## Outsourcing companies\nI have many years of experience working with two great companies KS Technology and Hansaem digitec.\n- KS Technology https://altium.kr/\n- Hansaem digitec https://www.hsdgt.com/main/main.html\n\n## Timeline\n**Phase I&II - Prototypes v0.1~1 (4 months)**\nNowadays, the development and manufacturing of a single-board computer might be trivial given the available knowledge. However, the challenge is to design a perfect combination of single board computer and breadbook layout that would give people the freedom to build creative circuits and prototypes.\n- [May~Aug 2023] Manufacture and test first 100 Noun-Computer prototypes\n- [Sep 2023] Sponsor ETH global hackathon NY by providing Noun-Computers for hardware competitions\n\n**Phase III - Mass Manufacturing (5 months)**\nMass manufacturing of Noun-Computer devices would require the development of manufacturing methods, safety approvals, quality control tests, etc. Manufacturing is a difficult process and it would be best to outsource it to a third-party company. There are a lot of companies that manufacture PCBs and electronic devices in Korea. We just need to invest time and money into developing requirements, manufacturing methods, and quality control.\n- [Sep~Oct 2023] Prototype v2\n- [Nov 2023] Mass production\n- [Jan 2024] Showcase Noun-Computers and Noun-Breadbook at CES and MWC, two of the most prestigious consumer electronics shows\n\n**Phase IV - Proliferation**\nThe proliferation phase is the time when the NounsDAO will be able to harvest fruits from its investment. We will bring NounsDAO to CES, where we alongside with most innovative companies. I will personally visit 10+ universities and give guest lectures and master classes on Noun-Computer and Noun-Breadbook. I will write an Interactive book based on Noun-Breadbook that will be used for ages to come.\n- Raise additional capital from investors (Shark tank) and put Noun-Computers in schools, universities, and malls around the US.\n\n## About me\nTwitter: [fiveoceans_dev](https://twitter.com/fiveoceans_dev)\nDuring my years in grad school, I worked on multiple projects that were published in science journals [[1]](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9061015/) [[2]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33187144/) [[3]](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-08037-y).\nNoun-Computer and Noun-Breadbook are my original idea and I would love to work with NounsDAO to bring these game-changing devices to life. I believe that Noun-Computer and Breadbook would be widely accepted in universities, schools, and startups. I will personally visit 10+ universities and give lectures and master classes on Noun-Computer and Noun-Breadbook. It is an expensive project and I do not think it would be possible without support from an open-minded community such as NounsDAO.\nHere is a photo of my previous single-board computer that I developed during my ph.d. years.\n![](https://i.imgur.com/IcMiqKe.jpg)\n\n\n## Budget\nIt is hard to give an exact size of the budget for such a project. However, in my experience, designing embedded systems, necessary software, manufacturing cost, and safety approvals and patents would be around $1.1 million. All excess money will be sent back to the NounsDAO treasury on March 1, 2024.\n\n**Phase I - Prototyping Noun-Computer (4 months)**\n**$150,000** - Noun-Computer prototype, stand with ports, and firmware development\n - Select components (Processor, DRAM, Interfaces etc)\n - Circuit design\n - PCB artwork with 6~8 layers (noggles themed)\n - Prototype manufacturing and testing\n\n**$50,000** - 1/2 fiveoceans_dev's compensation (I will use this funds to work full time on Nouns-Computers and offset prototyping expenses.\n**Subtotal: $200,000**\n\n**Phase II - Prototyping Noun-Breadbook (3 months)**\n**$170,000** - Noun-Breadbook prototype development and manufacturing methods\n - Binder and flexible pages concept design\n - Breadbook-pages prototype manufacturing using methods used in flexible electronics\n - Binder2pages interface prototyping\n - Pages2modules interface prototyping\n\n**$50,000** - 2/2 fiveoceans_dev's compensation (I will use this funds to offset expenses and write an interactive book based on Noun-Breadbook for electrical engineering and computer science majors).

Why not execute the project in several smaller phases?\nI spend a long time debating myself what is the best option to ask NounsDAO to fund the Noun-Computers project. Some members prefer to fund a proof of concept and request builders to submit proposals for recurrent funding. This option helps to protect the treasury from bad actors who do not keep their promises. To give the members confidence, we request that 82% of the funds be sent to a multi-sig safe with 4/7 well-known signers. Requesting a full amount at once would make it clear how much funds the DAO needs to commit to accomplish the full project. It also would allow me to focus only on execution.\n\n#### 2. What's in it for NounsDAO?\nThe NounsDAO would benefit by building a community of developers, onboarding student programmers, helping communities in need, and diversifying/decentralizing the Ethereum network. The first group of users is devs at ETH Global hackathons. I believe many enthusiasts would like to run an Ethereum staking node or develop applications. The second group of users is university students. There is a real opportunity to do a public good by teaching students programming, finding new blockchain builders, invite people to NounsDAO. The third group of users are people who can not afford a laptop. NounsDAO will be able to donate 30% of the supply of Noun-Computers to developing countries and minority groups. The fourth group is blockchain enthusiasts. There are not many affordable single-board computers that are specifically developed to run an Ethereum node. Currently, plug-and-play nodes cost $1,600~$3,500. Or alternative based on a raspberry pi 4 with all the dongles would cost around $360.\n\n#### 3. Why not allocate 100% of the supply to NounsDAO?\nIt is a very expensive project, and I believe it should have a long-term vision to guarantee a return on investment for NounsDAO. I am always very careful with the promises I make. In this proposal, I promise to allocate 30% or around 900~1,500 units of the supply to the Noun-Computers fund. Any nouner will be able to request the computer by submitting a proposal similar to Nouns Vision noggles. The rest of the supply will be sold and around $650,000 will be used to manufacture the next batch of Noun-Computers and develop new devices, modules, and tutorials. I think with that capital we will be able to continue growing the community around Noun-computers.\n\n#### 4. Why not just buy and give away raspberry pi computers?\nIt is a great option however, it is extremely difficult to buy a large batch of raspberry pi computers due to unavailability. Also, the prices are often determined by resellers. It is also much more meaningful to onboard new developers with nounish devices. Another big part of the proposal is to bring NounsDAO to ETH global hackathons and CES with new devices such as Noun-Breadbook.\n\n#### 5. Who are the end users of Noun-Computers?\nThe target users are devs at ETH Global hackathons,  blockchain supporters, university students, minority groups, and people in developing countries.\n\n#### 6. What would differentiate this from any other box of components and controller or other guides on the Internet? What are we multiplying here or what is this teaching differently?\nBy developing Noun-Computer and Breadbook we will be able to set a new standard for software and hardware prototyping. First, these devices will be affordable and available at a fixed price. Second, the form factor of the devices would allow users to freely bring their setups with them. Third, users will be able to develop good-looking setups that others can easily understand and follow. It is going to be a much more satisfying educational platform to learn coding and hacking. We can provide a solution to millions of people while continuously proliferating NounsDAO.\n\n#### 7. What SBC design will the board be based on? What SOM/ application processor would you use and have you done much of that design work before?\nThe main differences are MPUs have a ball grid array that has a high pin count and requires a more complex PCB Routing. Also, MPUs operate at GHz frequencies that require all signal routes to be of the same length/topology. Last, PCB boards for MPUs have more complex ICs and would require at least 6-8 layers. I previously designed boards with MCUs and working on an MPU board is new to me. For me working on projects with Nouns is also a learning opportunity.  I think constantly learning, new opportunities, and working with the community are what make NounsDAo so fun. Of course, I would use the help of my peers from academia to fine-tune the designs. I would like to design a Noun-Computer around AM62Ax Sitara MPU with Arm Cortex-A53 1.4 GHz. The SBC will feature the following ports and interfaces.\n- AM62Ax Sitara, Arm Cortex-A53 1.4 GHz\n- M.2 ports x2 for SSD, GPS modules, etc\n- MicroSD x1\n- Bluetooth & WiFi\n- Ethernet\n- 40-pin GPIO Header\n- USB-C x3 for power, tethered connection, peripherals, monitor, etc\n\n#### 9. Did you consider receiving compensation in Nouns instead?\nI would love someday to call myself a nouner! I would definitely try to save some of the money from compensation to acquire a noun (I requested two payments of $50,000 each as my compensation for this project). If this project will be approved I would need to work full time and dedicate myself to making a great Noun-Computer. Monetary compensation would give me the needed freedom to focus and succeed. I also think this project has a good chance to be profitable because the number of potential customers is huge. So it will be possible not only to guarantee the continuous proliferation of NounsDAO but also to return some of the money to the treasury by acquiring Nouns.","proposer":"0xDf6e59c6DF1E9500fd35A76FF4C62F9901E90019","startBlock":17194115,"endBlock":17230115,"executed":false},"votes":[{"support":0,"voter":"0x17Ae58ab79444AD5b8EE2e232CaF13C65c32aF75","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":0,"voter":"0x44b1b486Ce8d9C82f605626347a7B1F74ADD11DE","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":"Mostly I just have trouble seeing this prop be successful in terms of impact/proliferation relative to the ask - the plans for distribution also seem more speculative than ironed out ahead of time, which is fine in some scenarios but not if one is requesting over $1M imo. \n\nWould be curious to see how we can reduce scope and funding size to something that might make more sense for the DAO in terms of r/r."},{"support":0,"voter":"0x2ED22eA03fEA3e5BD90f6Fdd52C20c26ff6e1300","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":0,"voter":"0x7dE92ca2D0768cDbA376Aac853234D4EEd8d8B5C","numberOfVotes":16,"reason":""},{"support":0,"voter":"0xD25973a3Df7d2341DDEa48303a3E6AdDEc6184Bf","numberOfVotes":18,"reason":"six hundred tokens i'd rather pay wilson's rent for life "},{"support":0,"voter":"0x2767eDfee9f5ba743511Ee4187A596B302B43938","numberOfVotes":2,"reason":""},{"support":0,"voter":"0x5606B493c51316A9e65c9b2A00BbF7Ff92515A3E","numberOfVotes":9,"reason":""},{"support":0,"voter":"0x4754b7e3DEde42D71d6c92978f25F306176EC7e9","numberOfVotes":7,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x8321795bdACE7428D4faDFA30C2EE8e727e491e5","numberOfVotes":2,"reason":""},{"support":0,"voter":"0xDCb4117e3A00632efCaC3C169E0B23959f555E5e","numberOfVotes":17,"reason":""},{"support":0,"voter":"0x36A5Bc205DF1ED65C86301022cfc343a6ce546ff","numberOfVotes":2,"reason":""},{"support":0,"voter":"0x70eCe45cDc64A768f936Ccb8aC851578251363e3","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":"Agreed with nounalysis here... don't see how this prop justifies a $1M ask, and the distribution details just aren't there to even make an argument."},{"support":0,"voter":"0x860B328060180b2A14ae5C018AbA2Dd42D7ab6bA","numberOfVotes":9,"reason":""},{"support":0,"voter":"0x008c84421dA5527F462886cEc43D2717B686A7e4","numberOfVotes":16,"reason":""},{"support":0,"voter":"0xe085327c5AD2F77147F10973Fed45Fb19d734F7e","numberOfVotes":3,"reason":""},{"support":0,"voter":"0xF9bf4c994B39D742E568096A04637EDc5E8e6fdA","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":0,"voter":"0xc7A0D765C3aF6E2710bA05A56c5E2cA190C2E11e","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":"Love the idea of a Nouns computer!

The stated rationale was the following\n\n> 1. Dynamic quorum was designed so that contentious proposals would require a higher degree of support.\n> 2. Maximum quorum is currently too low to have changed the outcome of any recent proposals.\n> 3. Increasing maximum quorum should increase the percentage of successful proposals that are \"hell yes\" initiatives.\n\nWhat appears to be conveniently left out is the \"Why\" behind [Dynamic Quorum](https://mirror.xyz/0x10072dfc23771101dC042fD0014f263316a6E400/96zSoFfiT_RM2o2P9UbVKxPzVpB_trZqUjzllBE00BE): which was to protect the DAO from voter apathy as an attack vector in an effort to move the DAO one step closer to removing the veto.\n\nThe recent change is a misuse of this DAO parameter to serve a particular point of view. As Wilson Cusack [pointed out](https://twitter.com/WilsonCusack/status/1644338325908606976/photo/1), functionally speaking Dynamic Quorum serves to privilege against votes. \n\nGenerally speaking, contentious proposals lead to higher voter turnout. There may be a case to be made that setting Dynamic Quorum to 0 would incentivize higher voter participation and/or delegation—which would increase DAO health. The inverse may also be true, the higher the dynamic quorum the less incentive there is to participate on the margins given the increases barrier to successful proposals—which reduces DAO health.\n\nThis proposal will revert to *Maximum Quorum's* original setting of 15%, meanwhile encouraging further discussion on whether or not to remove the Dynamic Quorum altogether.\n\n**PROPOSAL TRANSACTIONS**\n_setDynamicQuorumParams: sets dynamic quorum params to:\n\nMinimum quorum BPs: 10% (1000 basis points) (no change).\nMaximum quorum BPs: 15% (1500 basis points).\nCoefficient: 1 (1,000,000 in unsigned integer with 6 decimal places) (no change).","proposer":"0xb9e43E4fA60C0a702A417d5E7e6Df37151C1dA28","startBlock":17199196,"endBlock":17235196,"executed":true},"votes":[{"support":1,"voter":"0xA86882277E69FbF0a51805cdc8b0a3a113079E63","numberOfVotes":2,"reason":"Its not yet clear to me what DQ parameters are actually healthy for the dao long term - there are good arguments to bring them up, or down, and its anyones guess what the perfect equilibrium would be.\n\nBut for now, im in favor of reducing max quorum."},{"support":1,"voter":"0x2ED22eA03fEA3e5BD90f6Fdd52C20c26ff6e1300","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":0,"voter":"0x7dE92ca2D0768cDbA376Aac853234D4EEd8d8B5C","numberOfVotes":16,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0xD25973a3Df7d2341DDEa48303a3E6AdDEc6184Bf","numberOfVotes":18,"reason":"which will is the better will? price or cusac?

A Dominican clothing brand founded in 2014. With an awareness of globalization, highlighting personal identity, LEBLANCSTUDIOS strives to become a social and cultural  movement that empowers an emerging generation of people across all continents to express themselves.  **LEBLANCSTUDIOS is available among retailers like [ODIN NYC](https://odinnewyork.com/) (USA) and [THE FORUMIST](https://store.theforumist.com/) (EUROPE)**.\n- **LEBLANCSTUDIOS will provide the following talent to the wears.wtf team**: \n    - 2 Senior Creative Directors & Co-Founders of LEBLANCSTUDIOS:\n        -  Angelo Beato & Yamil Arbaje\n    - Fashion Marketer, Pattern Maker, Material Sourcing Specialist, Production Manager, Sales/E-COMM Manager, Graphic Designer, Copywriter, Editor\n\n- **LEBLANCSTUDIOS is also providing already established partnerships with manufacturers in the following countries**: Turkey, Peru, India, Italy, Portugal, China, USA\n\n\n[necfas](https://twitter.com/necfas). I (necfas) have always desired to wear clothing that embodies the essence of Nouns in one way or another. Rather than purchasing generic t-shirts and having them embroidered or printed myself, I wanted apparel that genuinely reflects the unique significance that Nouns hold for me. As the nounish creative lead, my role is to ensure that the designs we create are in sync with the Nouns culture. I will be responsible for providing creative suggestions and guidance, aiming to produce intriguing and exceptional designs that best represent the essence of Nouns. This is a genuine, wholehearted attempt to offer something that could potentially bring significant value to the DAO. \n\n\n\n## **2 PHASES**\n### [PROOF-OF-DEMAND] & [PRODUCTION EXPANSION]\n\n- This phase aims to gauge the community's interest in the clothing line by producing a limited-edition, low-supply (100-200) collection. After the test drop, we'll be launching a 400 piece drop focused on the nounssentials line. Phase 1's marketing will be focused towards the Nouns community, twitter, and LEBLANCSTUDIOS' customer base. We will use promotional videos and clothing shoots to gather attention for the launch. \n\n    -  **Phase 1 will clearly define the following metrics**:\n        - Cost of Goods Sold \n        - Gross Margin\n        - Operating Expenses\n        - Net Profit Margin\n        - Sell-through Rate\n        - Conversion Rate\n        - Average Order Value (AOV)\n        - Return on Investment (ROI) - limited to the scale of the first collection\n    \n*The wears.wtf team will produce reports of these metrics on a regular basis in order to be as transparent as possible.* \n\n- Once PROOF-OF-DEMAND is completed, we'll move on to the next phase PRODUCTION EXPANSION, a future proposal. We'll start producing the other clothing lines, like NOUNSWEAR and NOUNSJACKETS (explained later in the prop). \n    - After the Production Expansion phase, the project will be able to support itself, and we'll always include special Nounish details in our branding to maintain the origin. We'll also make sure nounssentials are available to purchase online everyday, forever. Phase 2 will include a thourough marketing campaign that will focus on expanding to a broader audience, including non-crypto-natives by leveraging all of the metrics acquired during phase 1. \n\n    -  **Phase 2 will clearly define the following metrics**:\n        - Inventory Turnover\n        - Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) \n        - Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)\n        - Conversion Rate\n        - Customer Retention Rate\n        - Return on Investment (ROI) - overall various collections\n\n\n\n## **HOW**\n\n **Collaboration and Design Process**: \n- The LEBLANCSTUDIOS' team and I (necfas) have worked to create unique designs that resonate with the Nouns community. The design process will involve brainstorming, sketching, and refining concepts that embody the essence of the community and its values.\n-  This collaboration ensures that the final designs are a perfect blend of art, fashion, and what's considered nounish.\n\n**Design Selection and Production**: \n- After gathering feedback and iterating on the designs, the team will finalize 8 different designs for the nounssentials drop, once the [PROOF-OF-DEMAND] limited edition TEST drop is complete.\n- the [PROOF-OF-DEMAND] limited edition TEST drop will consist of 100-200 limited edition pieces.\n- The nounssentials 8 final designs, 400 piece drop will be done afterwards. \n\n*note: Scaling down production was considered, but even if the Nouns ecosystem doesn’t purchase the proposed amounts, LEBLANCSTUDIOS’ customer base will. They’ve shown excitement for the unique designs they’ve never seen before. It’s crucial for us to begin working on the next collection batch right after the test drop. Going through another proposal process, which would cause weeks of funding delay, wouldn’t be optimal for securing production spots and establishing dates with the manufacturers by paying upfront.*\n\n**Quality and Sustainability**: \n- The wears.wtf team has prioritized finding the best sustainable quality/price ratio for the garments. \n- We are in contact with reputable manufacturers to ensure ethically made clothing, and that the final products are not only stylish and comfortable but also durable. \n\n**Community Feedback and Iteration**: \n- Throughout the design process, the team will engage with the community through twitter & discord (JUNGLE, NOUNISH, NOUNCIL) to gather feedback on the proposed designs.\n-  By conducting polls, discussions, and sharing design mockups, the team will ensure that the community's preferences and ideas are taken into account. This iterative approach will help refine the designs, making them more appealing to the community members.\n\n**Launching the First Collection**: \n- Once the designs are finalized and produced, the first drop of the wears.wtf collection will be launched. This collection will focus on creating clothing that embodies the \"Clothing, Every Day, Forever\" concept, making it an essential piece for every Nouns community member's wardrobe. \n- By offering versatile and stylish garments, the collection aims to become an integral part of the community members' daily lives, allowing them to express their Nounishness.\n\n\n## **CLOTHING, EVERYDAY, FOREVER** \n\n### **NOUNSSENTIALS: Made for everyone. For Everyday, Forever.**\n- **Essential clothes** **made** **from sustainable materials** include items like organic cotton t-shirts, hemp or linen pants, and bamboo socks. By choosing sustainable materials for our everyday clothing, we can make a positive impact on the environment while also staying comfortable and stylish.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/BYTzO1m.png)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/CkvjwWq.png)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/YTMLZ8S.png)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/qKRb4am.png)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/GJUnNn6.png)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/5FphJbM.png)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/AQcSXGn.png)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/tJYYR8Q.png)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/DU75H6a.png)\n*THESE ARE NOT FINAL DESIGNS*\n\n\n### **NOUNSWEAR: Creative Expression**\n- NOUNSWEAR **aims to explore the streetwear and artistic aspects of clothing**, emphasizing creativity, unique designs, and personal expression, which caters to those looking to make a bold fashion statement. It will follow a drop-by-drop format with limited edition pieces, taking into account essential Nounish activities and accomplishments. \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/L4okh4b.png)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/ufqJU9Z.png)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/5UUylyH.png)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/PjQzU3b.png)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Vhzfy8j.png)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/HGnwvMa.png)\n*THESE ARE NOT FINAL DESIGNS*\n\n\n### **NOUNSJACKET: Nounish Representation**\n\n- The NOUNSJACKET **aims to be a set of tailor made jacket for different NOUNISH BUILDERS that have constant exposure to a wide audience** (Nouns Fair, Aubtoshi, Becco, Nounsesports, etc).\n- The jackets will be designed through back and forth conversations with differet builders about their preferences and the representative elements they would like in their jackets. Builders will be able to contact the team in order to tailor-make their jacket with the specific requirements they would want. \n![](https://i.imgur.com/u8vI8Fs.png)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Wg7vavU.png)\n*THESE ARE NOT FINAL DESIGNS*\n\n\n## **THIS ISN'T MERCH, THIS IS READY-TO-WEAR**\n- **Ready-to-wear clothing offers a superior level of comfort and everyday wearability compared to merch, thanks to its focus on quality materials, design, fit, and attention to detail**. These collections will be crafted by experienced designers who prioritize the use of high-quality fabrics and materials, ensuring a more comfortable and durable experience. \n- Moreover, ready-to-wear pieces will be meticulously designed with silhouette, fit, and proportion in mind, providing a better overall fit and feel. **The versatility of ready-to-wear clothing makes it easy for consumers to incorporate these pieces into their daily wardrobe**, as they offer a range of styles that can be easily mixed and matched.\n\n\n## **WHAT DOES A CC0 CLOTHING BRAND LOOK LIKE?**\n- We believe that wears⌐◨-◨.wtf has the potential to innovate in fashion by leveraging CC0 assets to create unique and innovative clothing designs. \n- By incorporating elements from various web3 projects and the broader public domain, wears.wtf can develop a diverse range of apparel that reflects the creative spirit of the internet and empowers individuals to express their unique identities.\n- As Nouns allows for this CC0-POWERED clothing brand, integration and collaboration with other artists, brands, and CC0 projects can lead to outstanding success by exploring a niche with a format that no one is currently exploring. \n\n\n## **TIMELINE [PROOF-OF-DEMAND]**\n![](https://i.imgur.com/CqaF99V.png)\n*TOTAL 26 WEEKS*\n*AVAILABLE FOR PURCHASE: EARLY NOVEMBER*\n\n\n## **PHASE 2: [PRODUCTION EXPANSION]** \n- The subsequent proposal will focus on funding a larger production and adopting a more targeted approach, informed by the metrics gathered during this initial phase. All profits generated in this first phase will be reinvested by wears.wtf to minimize expenses required for execution.\n    - In this phase, we'll develop NOUNSSENTIALS, NOUNSWEAR, and NOUNSJACKETS in collection sizes that meet the growing demand. \n    - After Phase 2, wears.wtf will be a self-sustainable project that proudly represents its origins in Nouns. \n        - After developing all Nounish lines, we'll then be open to explore collaborations with other communities like Cryptoadz, Checks, Opepen, CryptoDickButts, Mfers, Rektguy, etc. \n\n- As crypto, NFTs, and Web3 continue to grow, so will our consumer base. Together with LEBLANCSTUDIOS, we're dedicated to creating high-quality products that people will love not just for the designs, but for the quality as well.\n\n***Wears.wtf aims to establish itself as a valuable platform powered by Nouns, with the goal of creating a long-term project that benefits not only the Nouns ecosystem but also the broader web3 community.***\n\n## **BUDGET** \n![](https://i.imgur.com/UMjOx50.png)\n\n*Budget for phase 2 will be measurable once we have all of the metrics that will be provided by this first proposal.*","proposer":"0x1db19B9903c5510AA5a866ea643Eb021CD12Bda0","startBlock":17209672,"endBlock":17245672,"executed":false},"votes":[{"support":0,"voter":"0x5606B493c51316A9e65c9b2A00BbF7Ff92515A3E","numberOfVotes":9,"reason":""},{"support":0,"voter":"0x4754b7e3DEde42D71d6c92978f25F306176EC7e9","numberOfVotes":7,"reason":""},{"support":0,"voter":"0x36A5Bc205DF1ED65C86301022cfc343a6ce546ff","numberOfVotes":2,"reason":""},{"support":0,"voter":"0x860B328060180b2A14ae5C018AbA2Dd42D7ab6bA","numberOfVotes":9,"reason":""},{"support":0,"voter":"0xd57db91eE451B818c44fD95a44b952eD5C0Eb4e2","numberOfVotes":2,"reason":""},{"support":0,"voter":"0x008c84421dA5527F462886cEc43D2717B686A7e4","numberOfVotes":16,"reason":""},{"support":0,"voter":"0xe085327c5AD2F77147F10973Fed45Fb19d734F7e","numberOfVotes":3,"reason":""},{"support":0,"voter":"0xF9bf4c994B39D742E568096A04637EDc5E8e6fdA","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":0,"voter":"0x9d3BEDE31F1C3b8532b98d8a9569e4B5B3fB6Ba8","numberOfVotes":2,"reason":"On behalf of UglyDAO "},{"support":1,"voter":"0x7eD027076c9C3a2B92Dc97E8F8B7F52C79670ad0","numberOfVotes":0,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x2ED22eA03fEA3e5BD90f6Fdd52C20c26ff6e1300","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":0,"voter":"0xba2b9804FbffA8F1A8F7DC8dd600E21268beF09F","numberOfVotes":3,"reason":"prop/designs don't feel all that exciting.  ty though to necfas for putting this up!"},{"support":0,"voter":"0x70eCe45cDc64A768f936Ccb8aC851578251363e3","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":"Honestly, I just wouldn't wear any of this and the designs (and prop overall) aren't exciting enough for me to overcome personal taste.

We’re requesting $42,000 in funding to support PizzaDAO’s third global pizza party for [Bitcoin Pizza Day](https://twitter.com/RarePizzas/status/1528475500993208323) on May 22, 2023. Through this grant we’re seeking to co-brand Nouns x PizzaDAO’s Bitcoin Pizza Day events currently being organized in 90+ cities around the globe.\n\nAll funds collected through this grant will go towards purchasing pizza from independent pizzerias on Bitcoin Pizza Day for our pizza parties all over the world. [Learn more about PizzaDAO and Rare Pizzas here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNdbUERvVN4)\n\n## TLDR ⌐◧-◧\n\nThis proposal directly funds 12,000+ slices of pizza that will be distributed through local PizzaDAO events and community organizations on May 22, 2023.\n\n1. **Nounifying Bitcoin Pizza Day** Onboarding communities one slice at a time. Co-branding marketing materials, events, and media reaching tens of thousands of participants globally.\n2. **Nounish Pizza Parties** Proliferation through pizza and furthering Nouns OTG presence at PizzaDAO events\n3. **Nounish Social Activation** Nouns x PizzaDAO claimable NFT for event participants and online proliferators\n\n\n\n\n\n![Pizza Noun 292 and Molto Benny|690x345, 75%](https://i.postimg.cc/CxvDXsy5/1.png)\n\n\n\n\n\nWe believe that PizzaDAO is well-aligned as a Nounish brand partner for Nouns and our Global Pizza Party for Bitcoin Pizza Day provides a low-risk opportunity to advance proliferation of Nouns through earned media and activations at IRL events – all while doing some good and bringing people together with free pizza.\n\nPizzaDAO has been an active member of the Nounish community with our pizza parties at web3 conference events and in the Nounish community more broadly. This funding proposal would cement the vibes and values of PizzaDAO and Nouns together as well as spread the messages of community and funding weird stuff around the globe.\n\nPizzaDAO recently joined Nouns as a new member sub-DAO through the acquisition of the \"We Pizza\" Noun 292 and is committed to expanding the Nounish ecosystem through its events and network of contributors.\n\n\n![Pizza taste better when wearing Noggles |690x345, 75%](https://i.postimg.cc/zDnh8rm9/2.png)\n\n\n\n\n## WHO WE ARE ⌐◧-◧\n\nWe are a global community of hackers, pizza enthusiasts, NFT creators, collectors, artists and rebels who believe in using crypto to make the world a better place.\n\nPizzaDAO’s community is made up of new entrants to the industry and members that have been in the crypto space for years, including several NounsDAO members, early Bitcoin community organizers, Gitcoin KERNEL Fellows, and past award recipients. PizzaDAO alumni now work on countless other projects in the crypto space, a direct result of our commitment to education and onboarding.\n\n### Let's Form Group Collab.Land Mini-Doc ⌐◧-◧\n\n\n\n\n[![Snax.eth / Noun 292 |690x348](https://i.postimg.cc/0yvF49fx/Screenshot-050223-011515-PM.jpg)](https://youtu.be/qNdbUERvVN4)\n\n\n\n\n\n## OUR IMPACT ⌐◧-◧\n\nTo date, PizzaDAO has given away over $600,000 worth of real, edible pizza in more than 75 countries. You might have eaten some during previous global pizza parties or at NFT.NYC, DCentral Miami, NFT Paris, NFT Sydney, ETHDenver, SXSW, NFTLA, Consensus, or one of the many smaller events we've supported. Now, we need your help!\n\n* Over 200,000 slices served\n* Over 500 pizzerias supported\n* Presence in 75+ countries\n* Thousands of people onboarded to web3\n* Over $600,000 of pizza given away!\n\n![PizzaDAO Global Party Map|690x260, 75%](https://i.postimg.cc/9Q4FXdRr/Screenshot-2023-04-24-at-4-08-32-PM.png)\n\n\n## OUR MODEL ⌐◧-◧\n\nRare Pizzas is a cc0 project founded by the decentralized autonomous organization PizzaDAO. We came together on February 18th, 2021 to make 10,000 generative pizzas in a one-of-a-kind collaboration between 314 international toppings artists. This collaboration has gone on to raise over $1M through the sale of the NFTs, funding two global pizza parties and a large number of community events. As we build, our ultimate goal is to build solutions for independent pizzerias (software, marketing, consulting, etc.) and eventually conduct individual token-raises to enable communities to buy out their local pizzeria’s landlord and sign a rental contract with the pizzeria.\n\nLook beneath the hood of our pizza planning by visiting [parties.pizzadao.xyz](http://parties.pizzadao.xyz) and [playbook.pizzadao.xyz](http://playbook.pizzadao.xyz)\n\n## Nouns x PizzaDAO Bitcoin Pizza Day 2023 ⌐◧-◧\n\nBitcoin Pizza Day is already the one de facto crypto holiday. Together as a community, we can grow this celebration of cryptocurrency and pizza into a truly global event. The internet, cryptocurrency, and pizza are all global phenomena. Bringing them together by giving away free pizza funded by the blockchain is a strong invitation to the general public to join our ecosystem. We think that’s pretty Nounish!\n\n![PizzaDAO Global Pizza Party 2022 on an active volcano|690x407, 75%](https://i.postimg.cc/V6FzZ4TH/Screenshot-2023-04-24-at-4-24-19-PM.png)\n\n### Nounifying Bitcoin Pizza Day ⌐◧-◧\n\nWe want to onboard communities one slice at a time. Our goal is to Nounify Bitcoin Pizza Day while creating touch points with potential collaborators through IRL activations at community events. Nouns assets will be integrated throughout PizzaDAO’s marketing materials, events, and branding to highlight the partnership, presenting Nouns as the core contributor for PizzaDAO’s global pizza party 2023.\n\n![Molto Benny x Nouns|649x322, 75%](https://i.postimg.cc/qv9BNNyQ/Screenshot-2023-04-24-at-4-19-21-PM.png)\n\n\n### Nounish Pizza Parties ⌐◧-◧\n\nHaving Nounish gear present at our pizza parties makes a lasting impression on our guests. Nouns Pizza Party Kits featuring props and swag will be sent to organizers to allow attendees to participate in Nounish photobooths and other IRL activations. Parties will also feature cardboard cutouts of PizzaDAO’s \"We Pizza\" Noun #292 and co-branded material will be visible to attendees throughout the event and on social media. We had a strong Nounish presence at our Wen Pizza? party during NFT NYC and  a similarly strong presence at our event during Consensus ATX (we ordered a $600 box of Noun props from Big Shot Toyworks). See the results in videos like [this one](https://twitter.com/Pizza_DAO/status/1652495611445354497), which has over 8k views so far.\n\n![Nouns photobooth at PizzaDAO's NFTNYC party|690x460, 75%](https://i.postimg.cc/4yfSjpnN/1681422067825.jpg)\n\n\n### Nounish Social Activation ⌐◧-◧\n\nNouns x PizzaDAO NFTs designed by Nounish builder BigShotToyWorks featuring PizzaDAO’s pizza noun #292. QR code signs will be displayed at premier parties featuring PizzaDAO x Nouns Global Pizza Party branding to allow participants to claim a “PizzaNounies” NFT.\n\n![PizzaNounies NFT|500x500, 75%](https://i.postimg.cc/GtGRKFB7/image-1.png)\n\n\n\n### **WHY?**  ⌐◧-◧\n\nWe’re helping pizzerias around the world use crypto to empower their businesses while giving back to their communities. We believe that we can assist businesses to become community owned by tokenizing the pizzerias in our network using open source technology. Beyond that, we believe that pizza is a public good and that Rare Pizzas’ Art to Pizza model can be replicated to solve some of the world’s biggest problems while spreading joy (and sauce).\n\nWe created our Global Pizza Party as an accessible and fun way to get introduced to and utilize blockchain technologies. Plus, throwing a global pizza party is a good team-building exercise for Spaceship Earth!\n\n* We believe markets can be positive sum and can enrich communities\n* We believe that we can use digital scarcity to bring analog plenty\n* We believe artists deserve to be honored and compensated\n* We believe anyone should be allowed to help others without asking for permission\n* We believe memes are powerful vessels for raising awareness\n* We believe in equal inclusion of all pizza toppings (yes, even pineapple)\n\n## FUNDING BREAKDOWN ⌐◧-◧\n\n15% of funds collected through this grant will be used to purchase Nouns Pizza Party Kits containing Nouns swag and props from BigShotToyWorks. The remaining 85% of the funds collected through this grant will be used to purchase pizza from independent pizzerias all over the world for our events.\n\n![Funding Breakdown](https://i.postimg.cc/6QCJNRxJ/Screenshot-2023-05-02-at-1-28-59-PM.png)\n\n\n**Nouns Pizza Party Kits:**\n [Plastic Noggles ](https://bigshottoyshop.com/products/noggles-10pc-carton-red)\n[Paper Noggles](https://bigshottoyshop.com/products/nouns-paper-glasses-50-pack)\n[Noggle Pins ](https://bigshottoyshop.com/products/nouns-glasses-100-pack)\n\n## MULTISIG ⌐◧-◧\n\nFunds will be distributed to PizzaDAO.eth and supervised by Nounish countributors: \n* Snax\n* 87Bones \n* Oni\n* BigShotToyWorks\n* ProfWerder\n\n### “We Pizza” Noun 292\n![Noun 292|506x500, 50%](https://i.postimg.cc/m2pgGXrv/Screenshot-2023-04-30-at-10-20-16-PM.png)\n\n### Snax (PizzaDAO Founder)\n![Snax.eth x Nogglels|399x500, 50%](https://i.postimg.cc/W1sCXTjj/83767962-ae56-4881-b878-efa0edb64922.jpg)\n\n\n\n\n","proposer":"0x9AE8912ea6562957043c8d048641Aa9B450c397f","startBlock":17210853,"endBlock":17246853,"executed":true},"votes":[{"support":0,"voter":"0x860B328060180b2A14ae5C018AbA2Dd42D7ab6bA","numberOfVotes":9,"reason":""},{"support":0,"voter":"0x008c84421dA5527F462886cEc43D2717B686A7e4","numberOfVotes":16,"reason":""},{"support":0,"voter":"0xF9bf4c994B39D742E568096A04637EDc5E8e6fdA","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x00cDa37BfC3Dd20349Aa901Fe8646688218d8772","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x9d3BEDE31F1C3b8532b98d8a9569e4B5B3fB6Ba8","numberOfVotes":2,"reason":"*On behalf of UglyDAO*"},{"support":1,"voter":"0x2ED22eA03fEA3e5BD90f6Fdd52C20c26ff6e1300","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":0,"voter":"0xb0A2852750b15038cf9b5BE255a483e3063162d7","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x83fCFe8Ba2FEce9578F0BbaFeD4Ebf5E915045B9","numberOfVotes":18,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0xB52235DC0751ce6E171C51fbF459fd6637c6ccc8","numberOfVotes":3,"reason":""},{"support":0,"voter":"0xE6397F9A08F456541814efcE5dbB26e37Ed44268","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x86030dbbCe1c771Ff6622C20455cd3619aa93c05","numberOfVotes":54,"reason":""},{"support":0,"voter":"0x7dE92ca2D0768cDbA376Aac853234D4EEd8d8B5C","numberOfVotes":17,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0xE8D24bE3ABF6EB27B800F752A969D3C1E84fD401","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x696ed7b26f4B019CEeC78DC8b9140ad64A6f354B","numberOfVotes":9,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x2767eDfee9f5ba743511Ee4187A596B302B43938","numberOfVotes":2,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0xba2b9804FbffA8F1A8F7DC8dd600E21268beF09F","numberOfVotes":3,"reason":"fun prop!"},{"support":1,"voter":"0x7eD027076c9C3a2B92Dc97E8F8B7F52C79670ad0","numberOfVotes":0,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x91dCCAA260CC4616E1a6e6b693DB7207C5E42937","numberOfVotes":3,"reason":"nounish"},{"support":1,"voter":"0xDCb4117e3A00632efCaC3C169E0B23959f555E5e","numberOfVotes":17,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0xA86882277E69FbF0a51805cdc8b0a3a113079E63","numberOfVotes":2,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x1e66a3D0a6A327b1F29e8ACf3a3d9E1E4E088683","numberOfVotes":2,"reason":"\"I like Pizza Steve\""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x223D6A6D246D151afd7e68b6dAB6B2718319219B","numberOfVotes":21,"reason":"Price seems a bit steep, but this one seems more likely to proliferate the Nouns brand to outsiders than the average merch drop.

It was designed by the legendary Brazilian architect Oscar Niemeyer and was first opened in 1951 to host the São Paulo Art Biennial, which is one of the world's most prestigious art exhibitions. \n\nHosting the NFT.Brasil conference at the Bienal is a testament to the venue's reputation as a premier cultural destination, and it promises to be an ideal setting for the fusion of art and technology that is at the heart of the NFT movement.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/0gS9Ksp.jpg)\n\nThe event will be held on June 2nd, 3rd, and 4th and will be divided into two areas.

The second area will host talks and lectures, bringing the community together to discuss the technology and its impact on our present and future.

In partnership with Eletromedia, Brazil's leading Out of Home media company, NFT.Brasil will showcase artists' works at over 40,000 media spots throughout the cities of São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Belo Horizonte, and Fortaleza. \n\nWe want Nouns to be a part of this activation. **Last year at NFT.Rio, the same exhibition setup led the Nouns 367 sale bought by Sanuxo for 113.22 ETH.**\n\n### **PS:** Although what Eletromedia deliver in outreach is worth 400k USD, we've tailored a special nounish activation to just $25k.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/HrGlQ5F.jpg)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/gtsn3ig.jpg)\n\n#### Distribution of Eletromidia Presence in Sao Paulo\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/ydOnnUg.jpg)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Q1BghWr.png)\n\nOver 40,000 media spots throughout four big cities in Brazil, with a total population of **24,3 million people.**\n\n### Nouns Lounge\n\nThe 25m² lounge will be comfortable and have an inviting atmosphere for attendees to gather. The space will feature puffs, chairs, and tables strategically arranged to showcase the websites, auctions, and content from some nounish projects: **Nouns**, **Foodnouns**, **Gnars**, **Lil Nouns**, and **Nouns BR**.

It **puts Nouns at the heart of the event**, giving unrivaled **visibility** and **exposure**. Attendees will be drawn to the dynamic atmosphere around the speakers, and we will be perfectly positioned to engage with them as they move in and out of the area. Such special location will enable Nouns to build the brand and network. Three members of Nouns BR (JP, Guiriba and Debussy) will be there to welcome and onboard people who pass by the lounge. Additionally, we have planned some exciting magnet activations that are sure to grab the attention of passersby and draw them to our lounge.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/BlLWPOD.png)\n\n\n### Metaverse\n\nNFT.Brasil is creating a metaverse in either Cryptovoxels and Spatial, designed by the talented metarchitect Fabio Ema.

After the event, the Nouns building and avatars will be a legacy for the DAO. We are going to airdrop the building token in the wallet of all voters and also we will make the Nouns heads available as avatars, so anyone can be voxel-nounified to attend our metaverse agenda.\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/x64jCWN/ezgif-com-video-to-gif.gif)\n\n### Main Stage\n![](https://i.imgur.com/dRT2vCC.jpg)\n\n\nAubtoshi is an exciting addition to the lineup of main stage speakers at the upcoming NFT.Brasil event. As a highly influential figure in the Nouns community, Aubtoshi's presentation is sure to be a highlight of the event. Her expertise and experience within the Nouns ecosystem will provide valuable insights for attendees, while her engaging speaking style and natural charisma are sure to captivate the audience. \n\nWe'll also have a builders panel with Nouns BR members such as JP, Guiriba, Debussy, Vlad and others. They will tell  their stories within the ecosystem and invite the audience to join the Nouns community.\n\n### NFT.Brasil Exhibition\n\nNFT.Brasil is excited to announce that the upcoming exhibition will feature an exclusive art display by Nouns, alongside other highly respected collections such as Crypto Punks, and Doodles, BAYC and of course innovative navite brazilian collections. As one of the featured collections, Nouns will have a prominent position in the exhibition, offering visitors a chance to explore the ecosystem and engage with Nouns team. \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/uVh9ccj.png)\n\n**Building community, Every Day, Forever**\n\nThis event is not only a celebration of our achievements so far, but also a unique opportunity to showcase Nouns brand to millions of people across Brazil's largest cities for several weeks. As the biggest NFT event in the country, we have the chance to onboard thousands of new community members and take Nouns community in Brazil to the next level.\n\n## Budget Breakout in USDC \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/9romoyN.png)\n\n### - **NFT.Brasil Sponsorship**\n\n- Sponsorship Package T - $ 30.000,00\n    - Exhibition entry granted for Nouns holders and sub-DAOs holders\n    - 20 passports for 3-day event access (raffled off to the Brazilian community)\n    - Main stage speaker (Aubtoshi)\n    - Secondary stage talk (Builders panel)\n    - Brand exposure on social media and website\n    - Brand exposure within the event\n    - 25m² lounge\n    - 1 Twitter Spaces\n\n- Metaverse Construction - $ 10.000,00\n    - Exclusive Nouns building in the NFT.Brasil District on Spatial and Cryptovoxels\n    - Nouns activations in both metaverses during the event and for three months more\n\n- Street Galery - $ 25.000,00\n    - Eletromedia (OOH media in 4 capitals)\n    - 20 days, NFT.Brasil will host the largest open-air NFT exhibition in the world\n    - 40,000 media spots throughout the cities of São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Belo Horizonte, and Fortaleza\n\n\n### - **Nouns Activation**\n\n- Lounge Construction - $ 12.000,00\n    - 25m² Lounge - We will create a lounge entirely with the Nouns' vibe, with TVs broadcasting live auctions, comfortable bean bags for everyone to cozy up, lots of Nouns around for everyone to take pictures.

So what do we get for our $30k sponsorship exactly? One member of the team mentioned they negotiated the $80k package down to $30k, another member said we are getting the $200k package for $30k. I’m still left trying to figure out what we get for a $30k sponsorship and how can we verify this?  \n\nI requested that the team provide an invoice or some documentation of this $30k sponsorship package and what comes with it, but as of this vote I have not received this. \n\nThere are also inconsistent metrics cited for expected number of attendees.

Nouns Wet Wipes will become a permanent item in the market after this initial investment of **USD 31,450** + **2 ETH** (up from USD 19,050 prop 265).\n\n# Overview\nNouns Wet Wipes!! \n*It defends* (Against bacteria & viruses)!!\n*It protects* (Against bacteria & viruses)!!\n*It moisturizes* (Dry skin)!!\n*Now it spreads* (The Nouns Brand) !!!\n\n![B2](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52872018760_9b5f0a4406_c.jpg)\n\n# Goals\n1. Bringing Noun Wet Wipes to the masses, one pocket at a time!\n2. A thoughtful token to be given out during events.\n3. Inexpensive way of marketing the Noun’s brand to the public.\n4. After initial investment into print drums, the wet wipes can continuously be produced at a low cost, increasing Brand Awareness perpetually.\n\n# Details\nNothing beats the branding effect of a product that one carries around all day. Using these wipes will remind you of the Noun brand no matter where you are. Having these Nouns Wet Wipes sold near the checkout counters will definitely have an impact on brand awareness. With our custom eye catching wrapper, you just can’t miss it!\n\n**In our first prop we left out a lot of information which we thought (at that time) wasn’t really important or just minor details. We apologize and we have added them into this prop.**\n\n\n **WHY WIPES?**\n1. It's one of the common things you would carry around such as your keys, wallet, phone and sanitiser. A reminder of the Noun’s brand whenever you use it!\n2. Economical to give away during events. Has utility so won’t be thrown away once you get home from the events.\n3. Small enough to be easily displayed at the Checkout counters for maximum exposure.\n4. Have enough space on the back of the item to incorporate a qr-code.\n5. Something our team has experience working with!\n\n**PACK SIZE 8’s Consideration**\n\n***Why 8’s?***\n\n1. This is the pack size that most will carry around. Unless you have a baby then a bigger pack size is required during diaper changes, but we are not doing that here… yet!\n2. This is the pack size that takes up little space so it can be displayed at the checkout counter. \n3. Checkout counter sales are mostly ‘impulse’ buys and thus less price sensitive. As you move up the pack size, customers become more price sensitive. We have not reached scale production, therefore we cannot produce them at the lowest cost possible and thus need to target the less price sensitive range.\n4. Lowest cost to be given out at events.\n\n**Marketing Considerations**\nInitially we weren’t planning on asking for a big marketing budget, however it seems to be one of the biggest reasons for rejection of prop265. \n\n**Our initial plan**\nSell into retail outlets at cost to proliferate. We know (from sales data, can’t share where from sorry >_<) that wet wipes **average sales** per month at checkout counters (or POS = Point of Sale as we call it) are around **30** packs per month. \nWe have (110 cartons x 144 packs) 15,840 packs to sell off. \n- It will take 528 POS one month to sell off.\n- Or 44 POS per year. \n- 44 POS = 22 retail outlets with a minimum of 2 POS each.\n\n22 outlets is a very, very doable number just with our contacts alone, but it will take **ONE YEAR’s** time without any additional marketing funding. As some suggest we sell out in a shorter time frame, we shall therefore request a budget for marketing.\n\n## New Marketing Initiative\n**Goals**\n- To sell all wet wipes in **ONE MONTH**. Based on healthcare retail data, a distribution chain of 200 outlets yields close to $150 million in total revenue per annum. Through our networks, deploying to 110 outlets on day one is possible. That way, our product holding period will be kept to a minimum (< 30 days). \n- To incentivise the outlets to let out prime retail shelf space, we developed an extra budget to “rent” their prime-est location, which is their point of sale (POS) aka cashier counter location to display our impulse purchase / daily necessity item. Making it easier to reach the customers.\n- To boost the nounish branding and create a movement. Leveraging on the power of social media and the attractiveness of prizes.\n\n**‘Sell Out’ in 1 Month**\nIdeally, the wipes should be sold out within a month. With our current contacts, we should be able to ‘sell-in’ to 120 outlets nationwide but to further increase exposure, we will be renting *prime* space within the retail outlets.\n\n**‘Renting’ Prime Space - Cost USD 6,000**\nWe will pay for prime POS display space at certain higher volume retail outlets to greatly increase exposure. 3-month’s display will only cost around USD 60 per POS space (thanks to its small size). We plan to ‘rent’ 100 prime POS display spaces which would cost USD 6,000.\n\n![Prime Area](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52871984559_d00d9e56f7_c.jpg)\n***Example of prime retail space circled in red***\n\nThe moment we sell 80% of the wipes, we would make another batch. No cost to the DAO as it will be paid for from the sales of the first batch. This Prop is self sustaining and will continue to proliferate the Nouns Brand as long as we sell out and make new batches.\n\n**Social Media Marketing - Cost USD 650 + 1 Carton of Wipes**\nThe main objective of the marketing campaigns is to reach the local and online population rapidly and ***encourage community participation to proliferate*** the nouns brand.\n\n- Like & Share incentive: This campaign will be targeted at our retail partners, to share our content to their network, at a small incentive of $50 per quarter.  (Limited to 10 participating partners)\n- Video creation incentive: We will run an online 10 second video format contest for everyone to submit, and we will pick a winner and reward them with a $50 prize. (One per month for 3 months)\n- One carton of wipes will be set aside as the prizes for fun contests such as “Spot our Wipes in the Wild”, Fun Photo Submissions for customers who bought the wipes and uploaded in social media, etc.\n\n\n**Design Considerations**\nAgain initially we weren't going to spend much on design since it was going to be a minimum viable product (MVP), design would just increase the initial cost as well as the running cost of the product. Our experience with wet wipes was that as long as it had an eye-catching color and the word ‘wipes’ was visible, it would sell at the POS counter. Packaging design was low on our list of priorities. A quick search on Amazon would reveal that the best selling wipes have a simple and minimalistic design.\n\n![Original Wrapper](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52799159996_17b91fb903_c.jpg)\n***Original wrapper design from Prop 265***\n\nThe original wrapper’s simple design (F) and single color was chosen with the costing of the print drum in mind. Every color we add to the wrapper increases the cost of the print drum significantly. \n\nHowever the DAO has spoken. A minimum standard of design must be followed as hot.4156.eth replied in the vote, and so we shall deliver. We shall set a high bar for these wipes and our future product development designs.\n\nWe will increase the number of colors for the design of the wrapper from 1 color in Prop 265 to 5 colors. We will be asking for funding for 5 colors, if however the chosen design has less than 5 colors, the extra funds would be sent back to the DAO treasury.\n\n**Design Contest** *[Link](https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/design-win-eth-nouns-wet-wipes-design-contest/4411/19)*\nWe have received input from some very helpful friends and the community that design cost may spiral out of control and that the results are still not guaranteed. So as to not go overboard with the design budget while retaining control over how much we pay, we have opted for a ‘Community Design Contest’ style of choosing and paying for the design. \n\nPayment will be fixed at **2 Eth** for the designs of the wipes. Since there are 4 components of the design that are required for wipes we think it’s fair for the winning design to receive 1.5 Eth while 0.5 Eth will be split among the top 2-5 designers.\nThe four parts of the design.\n\n1. The wrapper\n2. The flap\n3. The box for holding 12 packs\n4. The 3D mockup of the product\n\n**The Contest Judges**\nThe judges of this contest would be the DAO itself so please choose which design you like best and let us know in the ‘Reason’ section when you vote. We will also take into account ‘Against’ votes if you did choose the design you like. 1 noun 1 vote. \n\n![Reason](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52872458095_478bc5e60f_z.jpg)\n\n# Distribution to Nouns DAO Events\n39 cartons of the wet wipes will be reserved for the events Nouns DAO has committed to attending (example: PROP 206) as well as future events that require merch to be given out. We will collect USD 5000 as shipping for this purpose, any leftovers will be returned to the DAO. If there’s a shortfall, the event organizers can pay the shipping to get it.\n\n# Specifications\nEach Pack will consist of 8 pcs of fragrance-free antibacterial wet wipe.\n\n- Wipes size: 150mm x 140mm\n- 12 packs in a Display Box \n- 12 boxes in a carton. Each carton contains 144 packs of wipes (8pcs)\n- Minimum order quantity (MOQ) for each run is 150 cartons.\n- Ingredients: Aqua, Propylene Glycol, Polyaminopropyl Biguanide, Polysorbate 20, Benzalkonium Chloride, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Tocopheryl Acetate and a bit of Nounishness ⌐◨-◨\n\nWet wipes will be manufactured by our vetted local manufacturer in Malaysia which are certified GMP ISO 22716:2007 & QMS ISO 9001:2015\n\n\n# Costing\n1. Design cost ------------------------------------------------------- 2 ETH\n2. Marketing cost\n    a. ‘Rent’ prime POS for maximum exposure—----------------- USD 6,000\n    b. Social media marketing —------------------------------------ USD 650\n3. Print drum for nouns sticker design (one-time cost) ---------- USD 2,000\n4. Custom wet wipes wrapper print mold (one-time cost) ------- USD 8,500\n5. Display Box mold  -------------------------------------------- USD 1,500\n6. 150 cartons of wet wipes (USD 52 per carton) ---------------- USD 7,800\n7. Shipping to 20 events around the world (2 cartons each) ----- USD 5,000\n\n**Total USD 31,450 + 2 ETH**\n\nPrint mold and drum prices increased from Prop 265 due to increased complexity and the number of colors of the designs. Printing costs also increased due to the increased colors thus increasing cost per carton from USD 49 to USD 52.\n\n# Team Remuneration\nWe plan to set the Recommended Retail Price of below USD 1 while making it worthwhile for retail outlets to sell. Our team will take the net proceeds (after deducting warehousing, logistic and distribution costs) from the sales of the 110 cartons (40 cartons reserved for events) as remuneration. If we don’t sell, we don’t get paid! \n\nFuture orders of this current design Noun wipes will cost significantly less as we already have the design and mold for the packaging.

Is this a public good?\n2. Is this public good something that other organizations won’t fund, or that Nouns is uniquely best to fund?\n\nThis proposal wants to build a sustainable, profitable business. Which is excellent! But it’s not building a public good. Likewise, there are many outlets for funding CPG branding plays, though they do often require some upfront capital.\n\nThis proposal also feels like a “proliferate the meme” type of proposal, which is fun and interesting, but doesn’t serve public goods.\n\nFor this reason, I was tempted to vote Against. At the same time, as I was analyzing this proposal, I began to think of all of the ways this brand could serve public goods-oreineted goals.\n\nThe design contest is an obvious starting point. Inviting artists to participate, and ideally having commissions or a portion of the profits flow back to them, is one way. The community contributions are strong here, showing that this brand is already acting as a gathering place.\n\nIt could also help other groups bootstrap knowledge in building CPG brands. Ideally, the team could aid other groups wanting to launch Nouns-related CPG projects. In the long run, fewer of these projects would need to be funded by the DAO and could instead be funded by an ecosystem of self-sustaining CPG brands.\n\nFor this reason, my inclination is to say yes to experimentation. I’d want to wait and see how this plays out before approving similar props. Does this end up as a community driven CPG initiative? If so, amazing! Does this continue forever as a self-sustaining wet wipes business business? A wonderful thing, but probably something that should have been funded by other venues. I am in favor of this proposal, but would want to wait for results before voting for similar proposals in the future.\n\nMy favorite design is Option A."},{"support":1,"voter":"0x281eC184E704CE57570614C33B3477Ec7Ff07243","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":"Nouns.

A pharmacy / retail tag team with extensive wet wipe experience.\n\nI appreciate the proposers attention to costs. Everything here is very reasonable, the unit costs, design and marketing costs, and the fact that they only get paid if they sell all of the items.  These would continue to be on the market with no additional costs to the DAO. On a simple level - easy, affordable merch for IRL activations.\n\nThis feels like an entry point to a larger strategy and I'm excited to see where these efforts lead. I hope they continue to engage with designers on future projects, I don't know if I'm ever really willing to compromise on design quality. I hope they take their profits and reinvest into developing their own proliferation flywheel with this, contributing to future growth alongside Nouns DAO.\n\nOn a tangent. I wonder if low-cost high-volume items is good for developing the brand, or if we should be targeting boutique high end products. But the ask is so reasonable here, and this carries the potential of becoming a self-sustaining Nouns proliferating flywheel.\n\nI say we let them wipe."},{"support":1,"voter":"0x43e3AB994070db606042e8DEfFD146300CB52919","numberOfVotes":2,"reason":"We like design A by SkipperLee"}]},{"prop":{"id":287,"description":"# NOUNISH FRIENDS mini-figures\n\n# NOUNISH FRIENDS Art Toy mini-figures\n \n  ![](https://i.imgur.com/dhXeIlA.jpg)\n\n**I. WHAT IS THIS PROJECT?**\n\nThese colorful 3” tall mini figures are meant to be a fun, stylish, low cost, and non-crypto-based entry point into the world of “NOUNs.” **Nounish Friends** are uniquely styled modular figures which are packed into mystery boxes, eye-catching counter displays positioned for museum shops, high end retail and lifestyle shops worldwide.\n\nThese unique designs represent a perfect evolution of the NOUN PFP to a beautiful and playful tactile art object. (Note: This series will feature 6 unique heads.  Additional characters will be added with future releases or collaborations with other projects.)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/WGKqT1P.jpg)\n\n**Why should Nouns fund these mini figures?**\n\nThese Nounish and high quality figures have a FUN modular play feature (interchangeable heads and glasses) that follows the unique building patterns of PFPs and creates infinite possibilities of fun and future extensions. The time is right to release a small colorful collection of figures like this to help promote NOUNS in all of their unique styles and interpretations. \n\n**A prop that assists future props:**\n\nThese mini figure designs are the type of product that will assist in any builders plans for proliferation. For example, David Horvath could use these in his activations in Japan and Korea, as well as NOTG and activations at Art Basel, ETHDenver & NFT London.\n\nCombined with the existing Bigshot Noggles and enamel pins, these mini figures round out a vibrant capsule collection of Nouns merch with mass appeal. This collection will be particularly useful for builders who are planning IRL activations around the world, and easily accessible since all items in the capsule can ship from one centralized location.\n\nThese items are currently being solicited worldwide to museum shops and boutique retail locations.  The feedback has been very positive in regards to design, quality and pricing, but the buyers all need a ship date and review samples before making any commitment to an unknown brand.  \n\nIf the prop is passed we should have these available for distribution all over the world by the end of the year!\n \n ![](https://i.imgur.com/15hqZeX.jpg)\n\n **What's the plan post-production?** \n\nWe have been in contact and actively soliciting retail/museum shop buyers, but they like to see something and order right away, so having production ready and a delivery schedule and final costs to present to them is imperative. \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/h972zIu.jpg)\n\n**Who is Bigshot and why are they a solid choice for collectibles?**\n\n[BIGHSHOT TOYWORKS](https://www.bigshottoyworks.com/) has been making high end collectibles and art toys for over 25 years. We have worked with brands such as Nike, Microsoft and Blizzard, and artists like Mark Ryden, Jeff Soto, Steven Harrington and Futura 2000. Bigshot is the premier producer of collectibles like this. We are also behind [NOUNWORKS.WTF](https://www.nounworks.wtf/) and the iconic IRL Noggles.\n\n**II. PROJECT DEVELOPMENT COSTS:**\n\n**TOTAL ASK: $125,000**\n\n·      $65,000 for production of 6,000 units (666 sets of toys)\n·      $40,000 for project management, marketing, distribution\n·      $20,000 for logistics and warehousing\n\nMarketing & project management includes daily factory interactions, QC checks, sample reviews, and revisions, and all aspects of the project related to production. We also handle photography, press outreach, social media campaigns & engagement, client & partner onboarding & follow ups, warehousing, reasonable shipping for marketing opportunities worldwide as needed.\n\n\n**PAYMENT SCHEDULE:** \nUpon passing of Prop, full amount will be sent to Gnosis safe in USDC. Payments to be sent to Bigshot in 3 milestones as follows:\n• 40% upfront ($50,000 USD): pre-production & production deposit stages\n• 30% on Milestone 1 ($37,500 USD): production balance, testing, sea shipping, duties, project management, marketing\n• 30% on Milestone 2 ($37,500 USD): warehousing, logistics, marketing, proliferation management\n\n**PAYMENT DETAILS**\n• GNOSIS SAFE: USDC will be sent to a Gnosis Safe with the following signers:\nBigshot Klim, noun12.eth, sasqwash.eth\n• The USDC will be held in a multisig and be released to Bigshot when Milestones are completed.\nMultisig Adress: [0x7C9878E913d6AE8Fe8cf10783Ded77070b9cA68E](https://etherscan.io/address/0x7C9878E913d6AE8Fe8cf10783Ded77070b9cA68E)\n\n**III. FUTURE STEPS**\n\nOur 6000 physical toys will be utilized for both wholesale and retail sales for maximum reach and value. We believe that both are important aspect of this proof-of-concept model moving forward:\n\n• 10% of the production will be allocated to community members and other Nouns initiatives like STUDIO1 activation in JP, Nouns Deli, Nouns Amigos, Nouns Africa and Art Basel Miami etc.(Shipping not included) \n• Units to be sold in shops at approx $16/toy, or approx $9 wholesale + shipping. A portion of the sales will be used to develop series 2 and will be put forth in a new proposal if the project is a success.\n• Option for DAO allocated additional quantities from this edition at $9/unit\n• Option to re-order at lower unit cost in a future run.\n• Option to create unique colorways & revised single figure packaging for targeted events and activations with NOUNish events like ALPS Dao, Gnars Dao, NOUNS Amigos. NOTG and Potential POP-UP retail activations.\n• We'd like to have some expedited product available for San Diego Comic-Con and David's activations in Japan to showcase and promote Nouns in key places.\n• All of the items ship from a central location in the USA so the marketing and proliferation logistics are perfectly aligned.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/q7YhCLQ.jpg)\n\nPROJECT HISTORY:\n\n[Prop 72](https://houseofnouns.wtf/nouns/proposals/72) was funded with 20ETH to take this project from initial idea, through countless iterations, to the current designs & prototypes. We have communicated updates weekly on the Discord here and have had many conversations on Discourse here, gathering feedback from over 50 comments to arrive at the final designs proposed in Prop 141. \n \n[Prop 141](https://houseofnouns.wtf/nouns/proposals/141) had some heated contentious voting at 78 for and 88 against with the majority of the for votes coming from individual holders.\n\nProp 141 has identified some pain points for the Nouners that are being addressed here to secure funding for production, marketing and distribution of these blind box minifigures to the museum shops, boutiques and art toy shops and galleries worldwide.\n\nThank you so much for your support, we look forward to getting this prop on chain, and to get these figures to the world in time for the holidays.

Content Proliferation & Total Reach**\n  -  Number of **proliferation instances** of our content is leveraged by others (e.g. KTLA using our content as b-roll)\n  -  **Total Reach** - how many people saw our content\n  \t  -  **Why this metric?**  \n  \t  \t\t-  This contains both our own reach, and reach by content proliferation.\n  \t  \t\t-  This is a proxy for the usefulness & quality of our content.\n  \t  \t\t-  It will lead us to making our content as accessible and re-usable as possible.\n  -  **Season 2 Goals:** \n  \t\t-  200 Instances of proliferation (vs. 50 in season 1)\n  \t\t-  5M Reach (vs. 3.75M in season 1)\n  \t\n**2. Social Media Followers** \n  -  Total followers on @nounish social media accounts\n  \t\t-   **Why this metric?** \n  \t\t\t-   This represents affinity with our content and is a proxy to our success as a \"voice of the Nouns brand\"\n-   **Season 2 Goals:**\n\t\t-   16,000 followers (2x)\n**3. Minutes of content published**\n* **Why this metric?**\n\t* During Season 1 we learned that having a constraint of the type of video we commit to make (e.g. short form or long form) is inefficient\n\t* We think our high quality content minutes should be fungible and that we should be able to choose the type of content that best fits the story.\n\t* This is an output metric and not an outcome metric, but we think it's important for the DAO to get a sense of what quantity of high quality content can be expected from this prop. \n* **Season 2 Goals:** \n\t* 90 minutes of high quality videos delivered (~same as season 1)\n\n\n## Content Pipeline for Season 2\n\n**Writing**\n* Nouns funding Crypto Infra \n* Agora, Prop House, etc.    \n* Nouns is a radical governance experiment\n\t* Covering from the beginning of the DAO and climaxing at the DAO Split implementation\n* What Makes a Nouner Tick?\n    * Include many Nouners vision for the DAO, what makes a good proposal to them etc.\n* Nouns Deli\n \n**Filming**\n* Nouns Esports \n* Xanadu\n\n**Post production**\n* Danit Peleg\n* Rose Parade\n\n\n## Prop House\n\nInvesting in high quality content is super valuable for the DAO, but we also should tap into the power of decentralization to proliferate our content as well. \n\nThe [first Prop House Round](https://prop.house/nounish/growth-hacking-nounish-content) is live and we will be running more of these, both open and targeted rounds. \n\n![](https://imgur.com/efLuwFl.png)\n\n\n## Open Sourcing our Content\n\nAs part of our effort to lean into content proliferation, we will be working on making our content more accessible and easy to use. \n\nSimilar to how nounish gifs are so easy to use on social media, we want our video content to be as accessible and easy to remix and reuse by anyone. \n\nIt will be searchable with tags and key terms, like a stock photo website but for Nouns media and all of it is CC0.\n\n\n![](https://imgur.com/U8qxFQ8.png)\n\n\n\n## Minting\n\nWe have started minting our work, to create a deeper connection with our content. The funds will be split between Nouns DAO and our distribution fund so that we can use the funds for further proliferation. \n\n![](https://imgur.com/mM1n6tk.png)\n\n\n## Team\n\nOur team consists of 10 people:\n* [Goldy](https://twitter.com/goldypix) - Lead\n* [142](https://twitter.com/noun142) - Lead\n* John - Creative Director / Editor\n* Haley - Executive Producer\n* Guy - Writer / Director / Editor\n* [Becco](https://twitter.com/Pixel_Becco) - Writer / Host\n* Meline - Producer / Editor\n* [Liam](https://twitter.com/LiamGordes) - Editor & VFX\n* [bk](https://twitter.com/0xbk_) - Social Media\n* 3 freelance helpers\n\n## About Pixel \nMost of our team is from [Pixel](https://pixel.melbourne/), a renowned boutique production company based in Melbourne, Australia. \n\nPixel is a perfect fit for Nouns -  they are experts in making tricky things happen, and believe that clever, complex, and wonderful ideas need nurturing from beginning to end. So they script, design, shoot, animate and finish projects in-house. They have worked across campaigns for world class brands including Adidas, Coca Cola, Toyota, Target, and Sesame Street.\n\nMore team bios in [Prop 143](https://nouns.wtf/vote/143).\n\n\n\n## Budget \n\n**Season 1 planned**\n* Team Compensation + Fixed Costs -

a retrospective on our last prop\n\nWe want to share our challenges and learnings during season 1 to augment the conversation in the DAO and highlight opportunities for other teams. \n\nOur two top challenges, which we dealt with throughout season 1 are:\n\n1. **Explaining Nouns is very hard**\n\t* Nouns is a very layered topic that is hard to explain succinctly.\n\t* If it's too simplified, it becomes boring and doesn't make any sense.\n\t* Breaking it into parts is also challenging because Nouns makes sense only as one package.\n\t* Different audiences and different contexts require different explanations.\n\t* **Learnings:**\n\t\t* Continue spending a lot of cycles experimenting with different ways and formats to explain Nouns.\n\t\t* Continue iterating on messaging and observing what resonates.\n\n2. **Figuring out our target audience is challenging** \n\t* Initially we tried to target potential builders as our audience, but we felt that it wasn't capturing the opportunity of getting more nouners and fans on board. \n\t* Halfway through season 1 we landed on the thesis that we are looking to reach early adopters of crypto and new tech who will find the Nouns experiment appealing. \n\t* We still don't know exactly who  Nouns resonate with most and who we should target.\n\t\t* We are missing data on the funnel and believe the DAO should spend more resources on figuring this out systematically.\n\t* We grappled a lot with the question of how we get people to **care** about the story of Nouns and the things being built on it and become fans.\n\t* **Learnings:**\n\t\t* **We need more funnel data** - we would love to see a team propose a data project for Nouns to:\n\t\t\t* Understand **who are the builders, nouners, and fans** of the brand\n\t\t\t* Map out the \"customer journey\" of each of the audience segments identified\n\t\t* We are **open sourcing our content** to let more parallel experiments on different audiences, to be run by more teams \n\t\t* In our opinion, proposals need to focus on making people care about Nouns\n\t\t\t* Our belief is that public good funding is the easiest shortcut to make people care about Nouns.\n\nAdditional challenges & learnings: \n\n\n\n* **We didn't get enough input and feedback from Nouners from across the DAO**\n\t* We received feedback that during season 1 we didn't cover the breadth of what Nouns funds - and focused on mostly creative props. \n\t* We want to represent and cater to various parts of the DAO, and we need to do a better job getting inputs from Nouners with varied visions for what the DAO is.\n\t* We want our content to be neutral and do the best job to represent as much as possible from various points of view in the DAO.\n\t* **In Season 2:**\n\t\t* We will consult various DAO members to hear what content they think would be powerful and useful, as well as represent their varied vision for the DAO.\n\t\t* We will take our lead from the Tech Pod's approach to coming to the DAO with a slate update and getting a read on what the DAO wants to see and prioritising it. \n\n\n\n\n* **The logistics of proposals is hard to manage**\n\t* We have limited control over the stories that we are reporting about, and that can hurt our content pipeline.\n\t* With many props, the timelines are in flux and it's difficult to plan ahead.\n\t* **Learnings:**\n\t\t* We focused more on making original content such as the Mega Explainer & 100 nounish things (*a video to be published soon, before the prop goes on chain*)\n\t\t* We created a Shorts format that is not dependent on specific props\n\t\t* [Creative Absurd](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oec19SUIyb8) focused on interviews and stories that are not dependent on delivery timing\n* **Over optimization around fast growth diminishes brand building** \n\t* When we focus too intently and on viral thumbnails & titles, it makes the brand cheaper\n\t* **Learning:**\n\t\t* We never want to get in a race to the bottom on virality.\n\t\t* We always want to be top of class in terms of our content, to maintain the Nouns brand as a premium brand.\n\t\t* We open source our content to let others also experiment with virality with less risk to the brand.\n\n* **Short form vs Long form and generally video formats** \n\t* Committing to a discrete number of videos, whether short or long, was a mistake:\n\t\t* Instead of thinking about how to maximize on content, we oftentimes focused too much on delivery formats and cadence.\n\t\t* We want to be free to experiment with more variations in lengths, format, style, and audiences.\n\t* **Learnings:**\n\t\t* We are shifting to a minutes-published goal and not a specific number of videos released.\n\t\t* We are shifting to a more open and experimental approach to what kind of videos we ship in terms of their content and story.\n\n* **It takes time to build momentum**\n\t* Ramping up internal momentum and onboarding our entire team took longer than expected - Nouns are hard to explain and to understand\n\t*  Building rapport and trust with builders and getting great content and input from them takes time.\n\t*  **Learnings**\n\t\t*  We believe that the DAO should hire world-class talent for long-term contracts to amortize the fixed cost of onboarding and momentum building\n\n\n\n# Stats\n\n## 3 million @nounish social media views\n\n* Out of 3M views, two videos stand out as outliers and got much more views than the rest:\n\t* [Taki from Nouns esports](https://www.instagram.com/reel/CreCH1zAR5Z/) -

This one is more unique, since it focuses on the “gathering place” part of the thesis.\n\nExplaining what Nouns does is extremely important. Even within Nouns, there are differing visions of the goal: A space for public goods? A meme to proliferate? A treasury that should focus on growth? When Nouns itself has so many different visions, it becomes especially important to synthesize and explain those visions to the world.\n\nAs someone who’s worked on explaining complex spaces like DAOs from scratch, I know that this is really, really hard. Getting the messaging right, finding the right balance between simplicity and nuance, and then getting the content out into the world takes a long time.

Just like how crypto startups shouldn’t decentralize before they have product-market fit, crypto media shouldn’t decentralize before they have “narrative-market fit”.\n\nI understand the desire to decentralize. I understand the concern about reach. I understand the hesitation about the size of the ask. But the reality is that, in my opinion, it’s too early for those things. Nouns needs to figure out how to tell its story, and frankly it’s not very good at it right now. Before we add many narratives and styles into the mix — which we should! — we should try to get one right.\n\nLet’s see what Nounish produces, give them time to accomplish the huge task in front of them, and then fund even more voices. Their content is easy to discover and remix — that is already a foundation for others to build on top of. The decentralization and reach will come in due time. It took half a decade for people to begin to understand what a DAO was. And then suddenly, it clicked for people all at once. Nouns is on a similar journey.

Our goal is to make Nouns a highly recognizable brand among Chinese-speaking individuals and to inspire ambitious builders within this community to engage with the Protocol.\n\n**Objectives**:\n1. Introduce Nouns DAO to Chinese-speaking individuals interested in web3, serving as their gateway to the space.\n2. Offer a comprehensive understanding of Nouns to Chinese-speaking individuals curious about its concept.\n3. Facilitate the integration of new Chinese builders, inspiring and connecting them with existing builders to generate ambitious and impactful proposals.\n4. Highlight funded projects and empower the Chinese community to share our content and narrative within their own networks.\n5. Empower builders to leverage our content for seamless interactions with Chinese brands and non-crypto organizations.\n\n**Opportunity:**\nAs the world’s most populous country, boasting over 1.4 billion people, China offers a vast potential market for Nouns. The nation’s more than 1 billion active internet users and over 1.2 billion mobile phone users further amplify the tremendous opportunities available.\n\nWe feel distribution of existing content is a huge opportunity within the DAO. Our ambition is to continue to proliferate the meme throughout this expansive territory. The recent decision by the DAO to fund a series of activations across China has provided the perfect springboard for our efforts. We intend to build on this momentum by launching a comprehensive, multi-platform social media campaign, leveraging local marketing expertise to cultivate a significant and enduring Nounish community within the country.\n\n![CN Digital Population](https://i.imgur.com/F4MEB9h.png)\n\n**Strategy:**\nIt is crucial to acknowledge that China’s digital landscape is distinctly unique, as most Chinese internet users lack access to western online content. The nation boasts various platforms and services exclusive to its market. We understand that customizing our marketing and outreach initiatives to cater different segments of the Chinese market is vital. As such, we aim to meticulously consider cultural subtleties, regulations, preferences, and values of Chinese internet users in order to adapt our strategy effectively.\n\nGiven the vast expanse of China and the diverse demographics that Nouns can resonate with, it is essential to involve numerous content creators and create tailored content streams for this region. To accomplish this, Oni intends to visit China during the pilot phase, collaborating directly with SCG's team on the ground and immersing himself in the local culture and web3/art communities. We are confident that our multi-platform strategy, combined with in-depth marketing knowledge of the market, will enable us to successfully attain this objective.\n\n## SCG Group\nOur expertise lies in helping brands penetrate the Chinese market and expand their footprint. With more than a decade of experience introducing international brands and artists to China, we leverage our profound understanding of both Chinese and Western cultures, as well as slang and trends, to drive consistent and organic growth. To date, we have amassed over 27 million followers for Western brands and artists in China.\n\nAt SCG Group, we meticulously select our partners, much like how the Nouns community carefully reviews and votes for each prop. This is mainly due to the significant amount of human resources we invest in tailoring plans for each project.\n\nNevertheless, Nouns immediately captured our attention due to its unique blend of technology, branding, and collective community experimentation. We admire the art, the permissionless approach to IP, and we aspire to play a pivotal role in facilitating China’s integration into the global Nouns community. \n\n\n\n[![Nouns x SCG](https://i.imgur.com/UBoq5Dw.gif)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUo2ljQmILQ) \n[Nouns x SCG in Time Square, New York City – February 26 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUo2ljQmILQ) \n*While visiting New York City earlier this year, SCG took the opportunity to create a fun video for placement on billboard in Times Square, highlighting a clip from The Wizard's Hat -- a recently funded nounish animated short.*\n\n## Core Team\n**Gedoumaru**: Founder & Managing Director of SCG\n![Gedoumaru](https://i.imgur.com/JgbmoQ6.jpg)\nWith over a decade of experience in driving growth for visionary brands and individuals across diverse markets, both in the East and the West, Gedoumaru has developed a unique set of skills that combines 1-on-1 guidance, strategic digital approach, and localized creative direction to help clients achieve significant and impactful growth.\n\nGedoumaru brings a unique and invaluable perspective to the team as she seamlessly bridges Eastern and Western cultures.

This remarkable growth can be attributed to our effective use of the #GlassAnimals hashtag\n* 2020 Jan: 1,383,000\n* 2022 Sep: 25,363,000\n\n\n[LoverFella x Glass Animals Minecraft Gaming Activation](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/lko48mx7k6loe4x/AAA9e5fdHEl4ite10E6V1U8Ma?preview=VID.mp4)\n[![LoverFella x Glass Animals](https://i.imgur.com/19Xfxs5.png)](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/lko48mx7k6loe4x/AAA9e5fdHEl4ite10E6V1U8Ma?preview=VID.mp4) \n\n\n\n\n\n**Jonas Blue**\n![Jonas Blue1](https://i.imgur.com/z3lRzef.png)\n\nTo help artists break through and increase their visibility in China, SCG always takes the initiative to carefully curate and recreate content that specifically caters to the Chinese audience's preferences.\n\nSCG built Jonas Blue's digital profile in China from scratch. One of the earliest posts we made was a live clip of his song \"By Your Side,\" which garnered an impressive 2.1M streams, 154,000 likes, 2,618 comments, and 1,787 reposts organically. In just one month, he gained over 40,000 followers on his Chinese social media accounts.\n\n![Jonas Blue2](https://i.imgur.com/92eH7TN.png)\n\n![Jonas Blue3](https://i.imgur.com/ZttoJjE.png)\n\nAfter collaborating with SCG for about 6 months, there has been a surge in traffic and heightened artist awareness for Jonas Blue in China. As a result, Chinese people have taken an interest in Jonas Blue and his work. Many content creators and influencers on social media platforms have spontaneously started recording and posting videos using his other songs, which has led to a couple of his other songs besides “By Your Side” going viral in China.\n\nFor example, more than 4,000 Douyin users have joined the \"Mama Challenge\" initiated by SCG under Jonas Blue's accounts. Each post has received an average of over 100,000 likes and 3,000 comments. The viral nature of this challenge has further promoted Jonas Blue's music and increased his reach in China.\n\n**Salvatore Ganacci**\n![Salvatore1](https://i.imgur.com/tOuAagj.png)\n\nTo build the profile of Salvatore Ganacci, a renowned Swedish artist with a distinctive, unconventional brand, in the Chinese market, we have undertaken a comprehensive effort to adapt and repurpose his contents to suit the local audience's sensibilities.\n\nOur approach has yielded excellent results, after reviewing his existing content we built the 3 videos listed above amassing a total of 25.3 million streams, 896,000 likes, and 55,432 comments. In a mere 3 months, his follower count has soared from 10,000 to an impressive 150,000 (15x).\n\n\n**Other Activations**\n- PUBG Mobile In-Game Cosmetics Marketing Campaign with Artist Alan Walker\n- Fortnite x Huya x Tencent Games Livestream (1M+ viewers)\n- IRL Artist/Brand Label Pop-up Shops\n![Other](https://i.imgur.com/JtqtsZA.png)\n\n\n## Planned Platforms for Nouns\n![Noggles](https://i.imgur.com/cjG6JMK.png)\n**Content Plan**\n- Post 5+ times/week on each of the 3 platforms\n- Oni will help drive creative direction and source global Nounish media from other communities/platforms\n- Focus on translation and posting of images & short-form videos from other platforms\n    -

It is an open-source, free, permission-less protocol that enables **Phased (milestone-based) or Periodic (recurring)** **payments**. This public good can support various payment modes, including peer-to-peer, DAO-to-DAO, community rounds, and grants without complex setup, shadow tokens, or intermediary protocol fees.\n\nNouns Stream does more than further the Nouns’ visual brand/meme; it helps push the ecosystem forward with easy-to-use public goods. This protocol has already been [audited by 0xMacro](https://0xmacro.com/library/audits/nouns-stream-1.html) and deployed across Ethereum ([Mainnet](https://etherscan.io/address/0xB13Afc4f39942b885A00A60A02295016BF82d447#code), [Goerli](https://goerli.etherscan.io/address/0xb6E0407F0094816a67b7d6E2FA27a87be9396f05#code)), Arbitrum ([Mainnet](https://arbiscan.io/address/0xb6E0407F0094816a67b7d6E2FA27a87be9396f05), Goerli), Optimism ([Mainnet](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0xb6E0407F0094816a67b7d6E2FA27a87be9396f05), Goerli), Polygon ([Mainnet](https://polygonscan.com/address/0xb6E0407F0094816a67b7d6E2FA27a87be9396f05), [Mumbai](https://mumbai.polygonscan.com/address/0xb6E0407F0094816a67b7d6E2FA27a87be9396f05)) and Base ([Goerli](https://goerli.basescan.org/address/0xb6E0407F0094816a67b7d6E2FA27a87be9396f05)).\n\nThe protocol developers, who are also Nouns’ holders, are asking for a retroactive grant of **16 eth** to cover the cost of the audit (US$25,000 ie ~14 eth) and deployment (US$5,000 ie ~2 eth).\n\n![Untitled](https://i.imgur.com/9g5l0ZE.png)\n\n# Problem\n\nNouns and Noun-ish DAOs have no recourse or control over outgoing funds due to a successful proposal. If a team fails to deliver or meet certain milestones, the community cannot vote to recall the remaining funds.\n\nMoreover, contributors to longer-running, phased projects need more certainty. Today they are forced to make a single, big ask for funding or create multiple proposals over the life of their project to secure continued funding. Unfortunately, such uncertainty doesn’t help set up ambitious developers, artists, and creators for success.\n\nLastly, as the community evolves, it may pay specific contributors— e.g., IRL Events Coordinator — a fixed amount per quarter, paid bi-weekly.\n\nWithin the community, we have seen a healthy debate between funding experiments to further the meme while keeping treasury spending in check. Tooling like Nouns Stream helps balance where milestone-based payments can commit to experiments and revert (via Proposal) if a project is not delivering the promised objectives.\n\n# Proposal\n\nThe Nouns Stream protocol is open-source, free, and permissionless. It allows anyone to set up an escrow account that is funded with funds later disbursed via one of two modes:\n\n1. Phased (i.e., milestone-based)\n2. Periodic (i.e., regular intervals)\n\nTo further clarify and formally define:\n\n1. **Phased:** these are milestone-based payments where the funds are set up to be disbursed in predefined amounts on fixed dates. The dates and amounts for each milestone are set up during contract deployment. Configuring payment amounts on a milestone basis allows for unique cases requiring larger upfront payments to bootstrap projects. For example, a proposal for 75 eth might be broken into four parts over some fixed dates like:\n    1. 04-10-2023: 35 eth\n    2. 04-20-2023: 5 eth\n    3. 04-30-2023: 15 eth\n    4. 05-15-2023: 20 eth\n2. **Periodic:** these are recurring payouts at fixed intervals defined in days or weeks. For example, a proposal could be set up to pay a community contributor 24 eth for the next three months (12 weeks) at two-week intervals, i.e., they will get paid 4 eth every two weeks from the escrow.\n\nThe Controller/Sender (e.g. Nouns Governor’s Contract in the case of Nouns DAO) is the only party that can cancel the escrow and recalls funds. The Receiver can’t withdraw funds before said strike dates. Such controls allow the community to create follow-up proposals and recall funds if a project is not believed to deliver on its promise long-term.\n\nThe protocol has a tipping mechanism where payments will be pushed to the receiving address if the payout is set up with a tip incentive. This avoids the need for Receiver to claim/withdraw funds. If no tip percentage is defined during contract deployment, the Receiver has to withdraw funds as they become available manually. Today, the tips are hard-coded to go to a fixed address. The developers will release an update within a few weeks where anyone who helps run these transactions can trigger transactions and earn tips.\n\nWith predictable payout timelines, Nouns Square can hold regular Demo Day sessions for projects to share progress against milestones 👀\n\nSome previous proposals that could’ve directly benefited from the proposed payment infrastructure include:\n\n- [Fund design, engineering, and community contributors](https://nouns.wtf/vote/17)\n- [Prop House Protocol: Public Infrastructure by Nouns DAO](https://nouns.wtf/vote/105)\n- [Nounish Dataverse, open source data](https://nouns.wtf/vote/240)\n- [Nouns Deli Melbourne: Piloting a Nounish Franchise Model](https://nouns.wtf/vote/254)\n\nNouns Stream distinguishes from existing protocols such as Juicebox and Sablier through focused features, better user experience and Nounish visual branding:\n\n1. It is visually propagating the Nouns meme\n2. Providing a point-and-click user experience that any proposer can use to set up an escrow\n3. Leverages CREATE2 opcode to provide future contract address, thus eliminating the need to pre-emptively deploy contracts or setup streams before Proposal has passed\n4. Phased payment unlocks on pre-determined milestone dates\n5. Capability to setup different payment amount for each phase within project\n6. Zero fees, forever, and low gas\n7. No secondary token to swap and manage\n8. Sender/Controller fully controls the funds, i.e., DAO or multi-sig, who adds funds to the deployed contract\n\n# Deliverables & Ask\n\nEverything has been built as open source and under the GPL license. The deliverables include a developer (React) SDK, allowing other developers to under this infrastructure within their applications. In addition, 0xMacro has [audited](https://0xmacro.com/library/audits/nouns-stream-1.html) the project.\n\n**The total ask for this project is 16 eth.**\n\nThis funding will help the developers (retroactively) cover:\n\n- cost of the audit completed by 0xMacro (US$25,000 ie ~14 eth)\n- cost of contract deployment across all networks (US$5,000 ie ~2 eth)\n\nIn the future, the developers want to extend Nouns Build and add these payout options natively (via pull request) to the project. However, this Proposal doesn’t ask for funding for any such future development:\n\n![Untitled](https://i.imgur.com/3OVz9Ll.png)\n\n# Contributors\n\nMatthew (evav.eth, Noun#604, LilNoun#5834+5, Builder#67, Gnar#3750): 5+ years as blockchain engineer who has worked on various protocols including [Burrata.xyz](http://Burrata.xyz).\n\nOsama (osama.eth, osamakhan.eth, Noun#463, LilNoun#5703, Builder#54, Gnar#553): 2+ years blockchain product/engineering and has helped build [OlympusDAO.finance](http://OlympusDAO.finance) and [Burrata.xyz](http://Burrata.xyz). \n\nOsama and Matthew have also been involved in the founding of Purple DAO — flagship Nouns Build DAO based around the Farcaster network.","proposer":"0x3B60e31CFC48a9074CD5bEbb26C9EAa77650a43F","startBlock":17269609,"endBlock":17305609,"executed":false},"votes":[{"support":1,"voter":"0x3B60e31CFC48a9074CD5bEbb26C9EAa77650a43F","numberOfVotes":2,"reason":"Incorporating milestone and flexible recurring payments into our toolkit is crucial.

The NFT exhibition will showcase Brazilian and international artists, collections, projects, and DAOs. The second area will host talks and lectures, bringing the community together to discuss the technology and its impact on our present and future. With a combination of NFT art exhibitions and speaker sessions, the event expects to attract over 30,000 individuals seeking knowledge, connections, and business opportunities in the field. São Paulo is one of the largest and most vibrant cities in the world, making it the perfect backdrop for this exciting event. \n\n## What does Nouns gets by funding this proposal?\n\nBesides being a huge celebration of the Nouns community in Brazil and what we've been building for 9 months after NFT.Rio, and also being a great chance to bring new people on board, Nouns DAO will get:\n\n### Open-air NFT exhibition - [Eletromedia](https://eletromidia.com.br/)\n\nFor 20 days, NFT.Brasil will host the largest open-air NFT exhibition in the world.

As a highly influential figure in the Nouns community, Aubtoshi's presentation is sure to be a highlight of the event. Her expertise and experience within the Nouns ecosystem will provide valuable insights for attendees, while her engaging speaking style and natural charisma are sure to captivate the audience. \n\nWe'll also have a builders panel with Nouns BR members such as JP, Guiriba, Debussy, Vlad and others. They will tell  their stories within the ecosystem and invite the audience to join the Nouns community.\n\n### NFT.Brasil Exhibition\n\nNFT.Brasil is excited to announce that the upcoming exhibition will feature an exclusive art display by Nouns, alongside other highly respected collections such as Crypto Punks, Doodles and of course innovative navite brazilian collections. As one of the featured collections, Nouns will have a prominent position in the exhibition, offering visitors a chance to explore the ecosystem and engage with Nouns team. \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/uVh9ccj.png)\n\n**Building community, Every Day, Forever**\n\nThis event is not only a celebration of our achievements so far, but also a unique opportunity to showcase Nouns brand to millions of people across Brazil's largest cities for several weeks. As the biggest NFT event in the country, we have the chance to onboard thousands of new community members and take Nouns community in Brazil to the next level.\n\nNFT.Brasil is going to bring more than 5,000 students from public schools with a unique 3-day opportunity to explore the world of digital art. This event not only offers a chance to appreciate the beauty of this art form but also serves as a platform for driving social impact and fostering community development. Alongside Skate Cuida, G10 Favelas, a group of  social impact leaders and entrepreneurs from the Favelas, plays a vital role in this initiative. \n\n## *\"THE REASON IS THE CAUSE AND THE CAUSE IS TO ADVANCE BRASIL IN FUTURE TECHNOLOGY\"*\n> Bob Burnquist\n\n## Budget Breakout in USDC \n\n### - **NFT.Brasil Sponsorship**\n\n- Sponsorship Package - $ 15.000,00 (-5k negotiated discount for ⌐◨-◨ only ) \n    - 13 passports and 40 expo tickets for 3-day event access (raffled off to the Brazilian community)\n    - Main stage speaker (Aubtoshi)\n    - Brand exposure on social media and website\n    - Brand exposure within the event\n    - 5m² booth space\n    ![](https://i.ibb.co/JBsWxYN/image.png)\n\n\n- Street Galery - $ 20.000,00 \n    - Eletromedia (OOH media in São Paulo)\n    - 13 days, NFT.Brasil will host the largest open-air NFT exhibition in the world\n    - [Over 1 Million ⌐◨-◨ impressions](https://eletromidia.com.br/) .\n    - Big Surprise\n\n\n### - **Nouns Activation**\n\n- Booth Construction and Nounification Costs - $ 1.680,00\n    - 3 days rental\n        - 2 TVS + Stands $ 500,00\n        - BackDrop $ 250,00\n        - Booth mobilia (Balcony, chairs, puff)  $ 580,00\n        - Nouns Decoration (Wall Stickers and Fabric) $ 350,00\n\n\n- Booth activation during the 3-day event - During the three-day event, three members of Nouns BR will be shifting in the booth, being entirely dedicated to onboarding new users.

Comments from the previous prop pasted below. \n\n——\n\nI’m voting against this prop. This conference seems pretty generic as far as NFT/ tech conferences go and I question how much value Nouns will get out of a sponsored presence. That being said, communication from the conference and proposing team has been *inconsistent* at best. \n\nOne of the biggest issues I noticed was 1/3 of the prop money ($30k) would go to a conference “sponsorship” and I still can’t figure out what we would get for that sponsorship. \n\nIn the conference brochure there isn’t a $30k sponsorship package listed, although the team claims they were able to negotiate with “inner web3 circle” for a better deal. \n\nThe sponsorship packages listed in the provided brochure are: $12k, $20k, $40k, $80k, and $200k. So what do we get for our $30k sponsorship exactly? One member of the team mentioned they negotiated the $80k package down to $30k, another member said we are getting the $200k package for $30k. I’m still left trying to figure out what we get for a $30k sponsorship and how can we verify this?  \n\nI requested that the team provide an invoice or some documentation of this $30k sponsorship package and what comes with it, but as of this vote I have not received this. \n\nThere are also inconsistent metrics cited for expected number of attendees. In the prop text, the proposing team claims 30,000 attendees are expected, but then in provided conference graphics the claim is 40,000 attendees are expected. \n\nI think there is enough inconsistency in statements from the team, provided graphics, and plans for spending our investment that we should not grant these funds."},{"support":0,"voter":"0x13eEf4EF8FCa471f242ab0F8F49A3dB6017aDA33","numberOfVotes":2,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0xBd7Dbab9AEb52D6c8d0E80fCeBdE3af4CC86204A","numberOfVotes":6,"reason":"nom nom Nouns in Brasil!\n\nThe community is Brasil is one of the strongest and most active communities in Nouns and love to see it continue to grow."},{"support":1,"voter":"0xE8D24bE3ABF6EB27B800F752A969D3C1E84fD401","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":0,"voter":"0xbc3ed6B537f2980e66f396Fe14210A56ba3f72C4","numberOfVotes":2,"reason":"I really appreciate the proposers.

The core of my reasoning hasn't changed since 285, as I don't think the core of the proposal has changed, either \n> I feel we have funded a lot of things focused on IRL activations recently (262, 257, 251, 218, 206, 197) and I am still sort of waiting for the dust to settle/a clear assessment of our ROI there. In particular, I don't feel a need to fund more NFT event sponsorship/attendance/activation type stuff. \n\nI know there was some pushback on this ROI point: a Noun was sold due to last year's activation! I really like framing returns in terms of bringing in Noun buyers, so I appreciate this. But I am not totally sure how to measure: is the return just the value of that auction? Is it the surplus value vs. the trailing average auction? Or something else? \n\nEven if we say the return should be counted as the total auction value, I feel compelled to stick with my feeling that spending on event sponsorships is not a good use of funds right now. It seems like there is an amazing Nouns community in Brazil and I would love to fund some crazy and fun stuff, perhaps like doubling down on the momentum around the Nounstacle?\n\nThanks again to the proposers!

We recognized the need to start a movement that promotes fun, fitness, and FRENship while showcasing the positive aspects of Nouns.\n\nOur long-term vision includes hosting a major road marathon with Nouns as the title sponsor and host, aiming to create a lasting impact on the industry's perception and proliferation.\n\n## Accomplishments So Far 🏅\n\nSince its inception in April 2023, the Nouns Running Club has made remarkable strides in achieving its goals of promoting physical fitness, community growth, and social responsibility. Here are some of our key accomplishments:\n\n- Grown to over 120 members on Telegram, with more joining every week 📈.\n- Over a thousand cumulative KMs run by members.\n- Established weekly run leaders in 8 different cities around the world (see below), providing members with the opportunity to participate in regular group runs 🌏.\n- Developed a strong brand identity, including a custom t-shirt, a dedicated Telegram chat, and a set of Telegram sticker packs created by [@MochiNFT](https://twitter.com/MochiNFT) on the recommendation of [@0xMaki](https://twitter.com/0xmaki).\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HJ3mJNzSh.png)\n\nThese accomplishments demonstrate the commitment and dedication of the Nouns Running Club. With the support of the wider Nouns DAO community, we aim to continue to grow and make an even greater impact.\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rk6fJVzBh.png)\n\n## Proliferation 📈\n\nHow does the Nouns Running Club promote proliferation of Nouns and Nounish-ness?\n\nOne of the major hurdles 🚧 to proliferation is the difficulty of introducing Nouns to people outside of crypto. However, we can jump over that hurdle by welcoming anyone, regardless of running ability, promoting the Nounish values of collaboration, diversity, and open participation.\n\nYou don't even need to hold NFTs or know what crypto is. If you can move from point A to B, you're invited! 🏃💨\n\nWearing our custom Nouns Running Club gear, we act as moving billboards, promoting Nouns to onlookers and fellow runners. Our events create opportunities for people to interact with the Nouns community in a fun, informal, and healthy context.\n\nOur goal is to reshape the social layer and showcase the positivity of Nouns to a wider audience.\n\n## Activities 🏃‍♀️\n\nThe Nouns Running Club will engage in two types of activities: Special Event Runs at Crypto Conferences and Local Chapter Weekly Runs. Both are key to our plan for growth and proliferation.\n\nThese are usually ~5km runs targeted towards beginners to run at a leisurely pace. We have a culture of \"No one left behind!\", which means we will always ensure that everyone is taken care of regardless of their pace.\n\nIn fact, it's in our motto:\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/ryEWrNzr2.png)\n\n### Special Event Runs at Crypto Conferences 🎟️\n\nBy doing special runs as a side-event to conferences, we can penetrate a much bigger audience as people from around the world fly in to attend these conferences. This has been proven by our genesis event in ETHGlobal Tokyo, which spawned the Tokyo, Taipei, Hong Kong, and Seoul chapters. See testimonials below!\n\n#### EthCC (Paris 🇫🇷) - July 17, 2023\n\nEthCC is the largest annual Ethereum event in Europe. Not only that, it is also a non-profit event by the local Ethereum community. Very Nounish! Owing to the fact that we do not currently have any local chapters in Europe, we hope this activation will allow us to grow some local chapters in the European region.\n\n#### DevConnect (Istanbul 🇹🇷) - November 13, 2023\n\nSince DevCon has been postponed, this will be the premier Ethereum event of the year. The location of Istanbul will also attract many attendees from all over Europe, and we believe that this will help bootstrap multiple European chapters as well.\n\n### Local Chapter Weekly Runs 🌍\n\nEach local chapter has its own run leaders who organize and guide weekly runs. These leaders serve as ambassadors of Nounish-ness in their respective localities, promoting the values of Nouns DAO and encouraging more people to join the ecosystem.\n\nBy integrating physical fitness with community engagement, we aim to create a unique, fun, and rewarding experience for all members of the community.\n\nCurrently, we have local chapters in the following cities:\n\n- Denver 🇺🇸 led by [@jp4g_](https://twitter.com/jp4g_)\n- Hong Kong 🇭🇰 led by [@Natalielpy](https://twitter.com/Natalielpy)\n- Kuala Lumpur 🇲🇾 led by [@motypes](https://twitter.com/motypes)\n- Santo Domingo 🇩🇴 led by [@necfas](https://twitter.com/necfas)\n- Seoul 🇰🇷 led by [@colorchipeth](https://twitter.com/colorchipeth)\n- Taipei 🇹🇼 led by [@AkiraWuc](https://twitter.com/AkiraWuc)\n- Tokyo 🇯🇵 led by [@shutollen](https://twitter.com/shutollen)\n- Vancouver 🇨🇦 led by [@adrianmcli](https://twitter.com/adrianmcli)\n\nWith the help of this proposal, we hope to expand to at least three more cities within the next 6 months, with a particular focus in the European region.\n\n## Budget 💰\n\nThe following is a rough estimate of the costs required for running the club for the next 6 months. The primary purpose of the funds is to enhance the experience of our club events to attract more newcomers and proliferate Nouns further into the world.\n\n### **1. Special Event Runs at Crypto Conferences**\n\n**1.1 ETHCC (Paris) & 1.2 DevConnect (Istanbul)**\n\n- Customized Local Logo Design: $1,000\n- Dry-Fit Running T-Shirts (30 units at $35 each): $1,050\n- Discretionary Fund: $2,000\n\n**Subtotal for Special Event Runs ($4,050 x 2): $8,100**\n\n### **2. Regular Operations at Local Chapter Weekly Runs**\n\n*(Estimated budget remains consistent across chapters)*\n\n**2.1 to 2.8: Tokyo 🇯🇵, Seoul 🇰🇷, Taipei 🇹🇼, Vancouver 🇨🇦, Hong Kong 🇭🇰, Denver 🇺🇸, Kuala Lumpur 🇲🇾, Santo Domingo 🇩🇴**\n\n- Customized Local Logo Design: $1,000\n- Dry-Fit Running T-Shirts (30 units at $35 each): $1,050\n- Discretionary Fund: $2,000\n\n**Subtotal for Local Chapter Weekly Runs ($4,050 x 8): $32,400**\n\n### **3. Expansion to Three Additional Cities**\n\n- Customized Local Logo Design: $1,000\n- Dry-Fit Running T-Shirts (30 units at $35 each): $1,050\n- Discretionary Fund: $2,000\n\n**Subtotal for Expansion to New Cities ($4,050 x 3): $12,150**\n\n### **4. Breakdown of Discretionary Spending**\n\nEach Discretionary Fund, amounting to $2,000 per city, is intended to enhance the overall running club experience and ensure smooth operations. It can be allocated as follows:\n\n- Promotional Materials (stickers, flyers): $200\n- Additional Swag (e.g., water bottles, towels, headbands): $500\n- Monthly Post-Run Gatherings (estimated $100 per gathering): $600\n- Online Collaborative Tools (Notion Plus, Google Workspace, etc.): $200\n- Contingency Reserve (for unexpected expenses): $500\n\n### **Total Estimated Budget: $52,650**\n\nThe budget proposal accounts for a cost of **approximately $4,050 per city or event for the next 6 months**.

Among them, \"Let's run together and create a healthy crypto culture!💪\" caught my attention due to my passion for exercise, so I immediately signed up. It proved to be a refreshing and much-needed event. Running amidst the beautiful Tokyo scenery, I bonded with fellow crypto industry acquaintances who shared a similar interest in fitness, allowing me to make friends quickly. Additionally, receiving a delightful printed t-shirt added to my happiness. Recognizing that I couldn't continue this running event upon returning to Seoul, I took the initiative to become the lead organizer and gather individuals for running sessions in my city.\"\n\n— [@colorchipeth](https://twitter.com/colorchipeth), Seoul Chapter Leader, Nouns Running Club\n\n> \"In the beginning of my first 5k run with Nouns Running Club, I was nervous because everyone else seemed to be much more experienced in running, but this feeling completely went away as the founder of the club, Adrian, stayed back and kept pace with me all the time. \n> \n> But what made me even more touched is what happened next. As we approached the 4km mark, the rest of the group, who had already completed the run, turned back and rejoined us. We were both very surprised and asked them why they came back. Akira, our Taipei Club leader, replied us with a warm smile, \"Of course we come back, we are a club.\" And another member (Jack, Denver chapter leader) also smiled and said to us \"No one left behind.\" In the end, we finished our 5k together as a united team. \n> \n> Thanks to this experience and the whole group, I started to like running and run with the club whenever I have time. And I hope that more people could experience what I have experienced. This club is not only about running, it's also about togetherness, care, and the pure kindness between people.\"\n\n— Sydney, Taipei Chapter Member, Nouns Running Club\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SJ_OgVfHh.png)\n\n## Conclusion 🎯\n\nIn conclusion, the Nouns DAO Running Club represents a unique amalgamation of health, community, and social responsibility.

Thousands of cumulative KM run is an excellent success metric. Adding some Nounish swag makes a lot of sense to me.\n\nTo Noun 12's point - I think an interesting path forward is for these running clubs to remain self-sustaining groups that continue to exist regardless of Nouns funding. That means not depending on Nouns funding for general operations, instead just focusing DAO bucks specifically on Nouns proliferation. Something to think about when starting new groups. These clubs are much more valuable to us if they aren't temporary and plan to exist with or without further funding.\n\nMy main request: more cell phone running videos!

Permanent storage media uploader**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/gVzs6Ih.png)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/IoUQQkb.png)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/KFIzROZ.png)\n\n* To improvise an [uploader](https://uploadr.app/) with some new features which we have built for the past few months.\n* Users are required for wallet connect (NNS supported) & it will be token gated focusing on Nouns ecosystem to use it for free ;\n    * Nounders\n    * Nouners\n    * Nounish Builders\n    * Sub DAOs\n    * Nouns' NFT Open Edition Holders / Droposals *(This Is Nouns, The Wizard's Hat etc)*\n* Anyone who has just got noun-pilled into the ecosystem and want to use it, they may choose from any of the available criteria above. This will gradually benefit the Nouns DAO ecosystem over time.\n* User can check their upload history together with the details *(eg; date, title & arweave link)*\n\n**3. Archivist/Contributor Leaderboard**\n\n* We want to create archivist/contributor leaderboard with gamification where top contributors will be incentivised.\n* We will use the fund under **OpEx** in ***Budget***.\n\n**4. Feed**\n\nUtilising a simplified and condensed data feed can be more efficient than navigating through an entire website for the required information, making data feed crucial for individual use cases. That is why we're adding feed as a new feature, to make it easier for you to access the data you need and achieve your goals more efficiently.\n\nWe will provide a few types of feed for the main & sub-category pages ;\n  * RSS feed - /rss.xml\n  * Atom  feed - /atom.xml\n  * JSON feed - /feed.json\n\nThe data we have gathered can be utilised by everyone in the ecosystem for their own unique purposes. For instance, a mini companion app can directly use the JSON feed to list all proposals in NSFW Small Grants.\n\n**For Proliferation Plan ;**\n\n**1. Publications - Nouns Archive '23**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/oDnnmMN.png)\n\n* We will produce a yearly curated physical book that features the archive's contents.\n* It would be a completed & working sample physical book which does not include mass production.\n* The prop house round winner's design will be featured as the book's cover. *(more details below)*\n* We will kickstart the pre-production of the book in June 2023.\n* All builders and artists will be contacted to obtain permission to use their works inside the book *(unless CC0)*\n* Anyone who wishes to contribute can do so as we will communicate the deadline for submitting materials.\n* We will make it available for pre-order/mint. Holders will need to redeem for a physical piece.\n* All **profits** goes to the Nouns DAO's treasury.\n* We are not taking any compensation due to already been funded by the DAO.\n* More infos regarding the launch will be announced.\n\n**2. Nouns Zines**\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/ry1WxY_N3.png)\n\n* We will produce a monthly curated zine that features great contents from Nouns ecosystem.\n* We believe that the focus of the first few issues contents should emphasise on onboarding more people towards Nouns and showing the most notable accomplishment from the first year of Nouns and on-going projects *(eg; Noundry, SuperBowl, Nouns Vision, TSP, Nouns Mural etc)*\n* The prop house round winner's design will be featured as the zine's cover. *(more details below)*\n* We will make it available for pre-order/mint & preview. Holders can also redeem for a physical piece *(the cost of shipping is borne by the holder)*\n* All **profits** goes to the Nouns DAO's treasury.\n* We are not taking any compensation due to already been funded by the DAO.\n* More infos regarding the launch will be announced.\n\n**3. Prop House Round - Nouns Archive**\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/B1zSnoUEn.png)\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rJgXjsUN2.png)\n*(Framework flow for each month)*\n\n* We will be producing two type of publications ; Nouns Zine & Nouns Archive '23.\n* We are looking at hosting our own prop house round, Nouns Archive. We will organize a few CC0 contests, with the selected winners being featured on the cover page & contents for Zine 01-05 & Nouns Archive '23.\n* Upon approval, we will start our first prop house round in June 2023.\n* There will be **six rounds** in total, 5 rounds for Nouns Zine & 1 round for Nouns Archive '23.\n* For each round, there will be ;\n    * 3 winners with a prize pool of **0.45E** *(1st/0.2E, 2nd/0.15E & 3rd/0.1E)*\n    * artwork of the **first-place winner** will be minted as open edition & to be featured as the zine cover of that month\n    * artworks of the **second & third-place winner** will be featured in the zine of that month\n    * **60%** of the proceeds goes to the DAO's treasury, **20%** goes to the artist & **20%** goes to Nouns Archive \n    * we will use **20%** of the proceeds to Nouns Archive to enhance the prize pool for future contests / add contest rounds / zine production etc\n    * for each round, it will be 3 weeks of submission period & 1 week of voting period\n    * Nouns ecosystem/holders are eligible to vote for the round. More infos will be announced\n\n**For Maintenance & Sustainability ;**\n\n**1. Data Permanence & Sustainability**\n\n* All compiled datas are stored in [Nouns Archive's notion](https://voadz.notion.site/Nouns-Archive-da52f93301dd4ed59e5b876bd5151d93).\n* We are using **Arweave** network to store all the datas due to its one time fee permanent storage and we want to use it exclusively for all storage going forward.\n* Currently, around **40%** of the datas are now saved on Arweave, with the remaining **60%** being processed. *(Currently on Notion)*\n* There have been a few instances where artists or builders have discontinued their hosting and lost their tracks; this is something we do not want to happen again.\n* We want to make sure all datas of Nouns ecosystem are permanently stored in a decentralised manner and is always accessible.\n* We are able to boost the website's performance with the help of **Vercel Edge Network** which offers image optimization, page load speed & automatically data cached on the network.\n* The cost of uploading will be factor in under **OpEx** as per attached in ***Budget***.\n\n**2.

I also understand that, since there was prior funding, the DAO is more hesitant to fund something unless it grows as a public good and accumulates more users.\n\nI don’t feel that I have a good grasp on the history of the proposal, so I do not feel confident making a decision. But I will add some point of meta-comment: Individual ideas here are really interesting, such as the Nouns Zine or the Prop House round for funding cover artworks. Splitting these out into their own proposals could be a great way to allow the DAO to pick and choose individual public goods to fund. At the same time, I understand that proposal revisions and the constant “If only there was one more thing…” type of feedback is not particularly helpful, so I know that you may not want to act on it."},{"support":1,"voter":"0x8ac3ecf6973E020cC0E6e8989Fb71B4a77D65987","numberOfVotes":2,"reason":""},{"support":2,"voter":"0xb8a9Ed8D008FA1F161809f15a11F4161FB8b717e","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":0,"voter":"0x44b1b486Ce8d9C82f605626347a7B1F74ADD11DE","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":"I have the same issue here as I do with the previous iteration of this proposal, which is that I don't believe the product in its current form has enough traction to be worth continuing investing in for the DAO."},{"support":1,"voter":"0x281eC184E704CE57570614C33B3477Ec7Ff07243","numberOfVotes":2,"reason":"I really enjoy archives.wtf and have sent the link out many times. Am I the only one who has actually used this site? It's great! There's an overwhelming amount of Nouns art on here and communicates a broad sense of Nouns and Nounish aesthetic. It's currently my 2nd favorite reference to send artists for research, second only to the actual Nouns DAO playground.\n\nIf Nouns is going to last forever, shouldn't we be archiving everything?\n\nI would be happy to fund this as is, but it doesn't look like it will pass. In the next iteration of this prop I would like to see the following:\n\n1. A continued focus on CC0. The art is all interesting, mostly for skimming though. I can actually use the CC0 content! I can put it in videos, art, put it on a shirt. The more this focuses on CC0 media the more it enables and encourages viral permissionless growth of Nouns.\n\n2. The Nouns DAO on-chain proposals section needs to be fleshed out more, and could also be a serious justification for this project. Each funded DAO proposal should have a ton of meta-media. Behind the scenes shots, interviews with the proposer, images from the on-chain prop, screenshots and screen recordings of anything digital. Currently most props have 1-4 images and it doesn't feel comprehensive. Work with the prop submitters and teams to really get a thorough pile of media from them.\n\n3. Better top-level organization of content. I don't really understand the difference between NOUNS SPECIAL and NOUNS WORLD and NOUNS on the front page - it should be way more intuitive. Each item on the front page needs to be essential and obvious.\n\n4. This prop is probably too focused on the design and tech. It looks beautiful, and the arweave uploader is cool, but I think the focus really needs to be on usability, figuring out exactly what needs this fulfills, and on the content itself.\n\nI know on-chain rejections are challenging, but I encourage this team to workshop the proposal one more time and submit again. There is high quality work being done here and I would like to see it continued."}]},{"prop":{"id":298,"description":"# Introducing Noun Computers - An Ethereum Node Prototype\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/BibDiu5.png)\n\n## TL;DR\nIntroducing Noun Computers! I propose to fund the development of credit card-sized computers that would be ideal for Ethereum staking.\n\nNounsDAO's commitment to making individual staking fun and popular would be a net plus for the whole network and ecosystem's well-being.\n\nIn my opinion, focusing on the public good would increase the recognition and respect for NounsDAO, which is the best strategy for proliferation.\n\n## Description\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rk8iWv2H3.gif)\n\nA lot of good single-board computers are available on the market, and the competition is stiff. However, the purpose of Noun Computers is not to dominate the market or make good profits. It is about a mission to do public good and unite like-minded developers, which will propel the nounish culture and memes. Of course, the key to success is a sustainable model. I believe Noun Computers will be successful because NounsDAO has an amazing culture, a better understanding of community, and connections in the blockchain circles. \n\nI propose the development of Noun Computers, which would run Linux operating system. These computers would be designed specifically for convenient Ethereum stacking, blockchain development, and practical programming learning. By doing so, we can establish a vibrant community of software and hardware developers who will eventually become good supporters and contributors to NounsDAO.\n\nJust imagine, the next thousand ethereum stakers (potential nouners) are mingling somewhere at blockchain conferences at this very moment! A cool gadget like Noun Computer would make for a great conversation starter. It has the potential to attract the attention of numerous high-profile individuals. We will be able to onboard many people to buy our Noun Computers and run Ethereum nodes.\n\n## Noun Computers\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/r1k5pljSn.png)\n\nNoun Computers will provide affordability, versatility, and the best price/performance/user experience within its category. I will design the Noun Computers from scratch. I majored in electrical engineering and computer science and have experience developing similar computer boards. Noun computers will be perfectly suited for running Ethereum nodes, software/hardware hacking, and teaching programming. \n\nOnce the project is completed, I will deliver PCB designs, blueprints, bill of materials, and estimated costs for mass production. In the future, NounsDAO will have the ability to order large batches of computers at wholesale prices. Additionally, we can develop expansion modules, interesting interfaces, and manufacture nounish cases to further enhance the product line.\n\nIn this project, I will focus on developing state of the art prototypes and estimating manufacturing cost. The limited supply of 50 prototypes will be used to create visibility and promote NounsDAO at conferences.\n\n- A Noun Computer equipped with a 1.5GHz CPU, 8GB RAM, and a 2TB M.2 SSD for running an Ethereum node will cost around $80 to $110.\n- A light version of Noun Computer with less memory can cost as low as $50\n- If there is significant demand and Noun Computers are produced in large quantities (3,000-5,000 units), the manufacturing cost can be further lowered, making Noun Computers a sustainable model for proliferation. The proceeds from sales could then be utilized to manufacture more computers and introduce additional accessories.\n\n## Deliverables\n- Design blueprints, schematics, and a plan for mass production of Noun Computers\n- 50 units of Noun Computer prototypes with aluminum head-crt-bsod case\n    - 10 units - distributed to Nouns' auction winners (starting with the first auction on the opening day of ETH Global NY or Istanbul)\n    - 10 units - showcase and distribute at conferences\n    - 30 units - organize ETH Global Hackathon competition centered around Noun Computers\n\n## Timeline\n**Phase I - Prototyping (4~6 months)**\n- [Jun~Aug 2023] Design and Manufacture Noun-Computer prototypes\n- [Sep or Nov 2023] Bring Noun Computers to ETH Global hackathon and organize hacking competition\n\n## Outsourcing companies\nI have many years of experience working with two great companies KS Technology and Hansaem digitec.\n- KS Technology https://altium.kr/\n- Hansaem digitec https://www.hsdgt.com/main/main.html\n\n## Future opportunities\n- **[Proliferation]** We can **sponsor ETH hackathons** and supply Noun Computers for hardware hackathons. Expansion modules such as camera, NFC, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, GPS, and others would open doors for new, fun, and practical blockchain applications. In the long term, we can grow a community of developers around Noun Computers.\n- **[Onboarding]** We can manufacture Noun Computers in large quantities and offer them at affordable prices. By doing so, we could **onboard the Ethereum community** and encourage their contribution to the decentralization of the Ethereum network by **running Ethereum nodes**.\n- **[Public Good]** We can **allocate 20%~30%** of the future supply of Noun Computers to NounsDAO Public Good Fund. Nouners will be able to request computers via an on-chain proposal and send them to **developing countries and minority groups**. Noun Computers can be used to teach practical programming at schools and universities. It is a good way to put resources into the hands of people.\n\n## Person In Charge\nTwitter: [fiveoceans_dev](https://twitter.com/fiveoceans_dev)\nHey!

Let’s make one that everybody can use. Recognizable, fun, CC0. For Nouns projects, products and beyond. \nRequesting 18 eth. \n\n### See the draft letter drawings in use: [nounsfonts.wtf](https://nounsfonts.wtf)\n\n## WHY\nOn websites, videos, gear, and other items, the display typeface a user sees is one of the most critical aspects of visual recognition. \n    \nA display typeface performs numerous functions like an oft-needed guide for a weary traveler. It reassures users, gives them a good feeling, creates understanding, and establishes direction. Of all the typefaces used in Nouns materials–outside of Nountown–none feel particularly Nounish. This is because there aren’t any genuinely Nounish display fonts available for use. We aim to solve that–Nouners need more tools for their evergrowing toolbox to help spread the lore of Nouns.\n    \nThe [Nountown](https://nouns.center/assets) typeface is inspiring. Picking up where Gremplin left off, I propose creating a unique, beautiful, functional Nounish display typeface with a CC0 license available for general use. We use CC0, so this font can be a starting point for a whole suite of open-source Nounish fonts, bolstering the ecosystem visually. **Nouns Display is a font L1 that many L2s can be built on. Eg., Nouns Display and lil nouns display.**\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/B1_CqbhBn.png)\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/B1Xaobnr2.png)\n   \nThanks to the generous support of our [prop house proposal](https://prop.house/proposal/5071) we have a start. The initial sketches, and process can be seen on our microsite [nounsfonts.wtf ](https://nounsfonts.wtf)\n\nThis proposal allows us to finish a full-featured CCO typeface that everyone can use on nouns projects, products, and beyond.\n\n    \n## GETTING IT OUT THERE\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rJCC9AsH3.jpg)\n\nWe will produce a limited run of distinctly tasteful gear featuring the typeface upon launch.\n\nWe will submit Nouns Display for inclusion in the Google Fonts catalogue for wide distribution and easy use in Figma. \n    \nIt will be used on [Zora’s new profiles pages](https://zora.co/profiles). \n    \nWe will structure a Zora-based NFT launch when the typeface is complete. **Nouns Display would be the first NFT of a usable production typeface, effectively disrupting the typeface industry with NFTs and opening up a new paradigm for fonts as financial assets.**\n\n\n## WHO\nI am Marco Braunschweiler, a designer with a background in art, and I make typefaces that I use everyday.

This pattern has played out over and over.\n\nI believe Marco is a great person to expand Nouns to new audiences in typography and graphic design. 18 eth is a very modest ask relative to the potential upside, and just looking at raw opportunity cost, i think its a no-brainer for the dao to fund Marco."},{"support":0,"voter":"0xe085327c5AD2F77147F10973Fed45Fb19d734F7e","numberOfVotes":3,"reason":""},{"support":0,"voter":"0x520F977ff2fb5fc3a188B9B7821d583BC8741BC7","numberOfVotes":4,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0xaE65E700f3f8904ac1007d47a5309dD26f8146c0","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":"+1 to krel's and seneca's vote reasons. worth having a shot on goal for a good display font many can use. doesn't have to be THE font but something many like to use would be a good aim.

[{"prop":{"id":200,"description":"# Nouns Mail: A Token-Gated Email Address\n\n_Thank you to Lakshman Sankar and Maksim Stepanenko for delegating Nouns to submit this proposal._\n\n_We would also like to thank Prop House and Nouns voters for their support in [Open Round 13](https://prop.house/nouns/open-round-13/2392). This proposal serves to update the community on our progress and request the remaining funds necessary for the development of Nouns Mail._\n\n## tl;dr\nA token-gated email address for every Nouns holder to pseudonymously communicate and access the rest of the internet.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/DpLdRUv.jpg)\n\n\n## The Problem\n\nNouns is the most interesting experiment happening in decentralized governance and community. Yet, large swaths of the internet remain segregated from on-chain identities. Currently, Nouners cannot connect their Ethereum wallets to access Twitter, collaborate on a Figma document, or even engage on the [Nouns forum](https://discourse.nouns.wtf/).\n\nEmail addresses remain a necessity to access most platforms on the internet. Existing email providers do not natively integrate with Nouns identity, compelling Nouns to manually link aspects of their on-chain identity to off-chain platforms.\n\nWe elaborate more on this problem and discuss solutions in [The Identity Gap](https://app.skiff.com/docs/3e5c70ba-ce96-48fb-a6e7-be34b6e6c77e#tFlZDTabPylC4WiIdCQ+dRLfE2ZoWZ/uUrqBlx7cUUM=).\n\n## The Proposal\n\nEvery Nouns owner will be able to claim a unique, token-gated email address under `@nouns.email`, or another domain decided by the DAO. Claiming this email address will be enforced by querying to an Ethereum node verifying ownership of a Noun.\n\n**Use cases**\n\nHere we suggest four initial categories of how our proposal can provide utility for Nouns. Should the proposal be accepted, we hope to assist in building out these use cases — like a weekly email newsletter or a `@nouns.email` domain-gated Figma.\n\nWe encourage the community to suggest additional use cases — Nouns Mail is a primitive that can unlock a Cambrian explosion of creativity.\n\nGreater utility for owning a Noun (through Nouns Mail or otherwise) increases the demand for minting Nouns or paying royalties on secondary transactions, leading to a larger treasury for the DAO.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Egs08Y3.jpg)\n\n\n**Implementation**\n\nNounsDAO allocates a domain to be used as the official email domain for Nouns holders. We suggest `nouns.email` because of its familiarity, but any reasonable domain owned by the DAO or available on the market would suffice.\n\nWe will be using [Skiff Mail](https://skiff.com/mail), an open source, end-to-end encrypted mail provider, as the interface and mailserver for the custom domain.\n\nAll emails sent and received by Nouns email addresses are encrypted with elliptic curve crypto (Curve25519 keypairs), and emails that are sent or received to other Skiff accounts (e.g. other Nouns holders) are end-to-end encrypted. Ownership of EOAs is verified by generating a unique challenge token, requesting an ECSDA signature, and verifying the signature’s validity. A full description of Skiff’s protocol and threat model can be found at [skiff.com/whitepaper](https://skiff.com/whitepaper).\n\nAs previously mentioned, verification of Nouns ownership occur by querying an Ethereum indexer on the [Nouns token contract](https://etherscan.io/token/0x9c8ff314c9bc7f6e59a9d9225fb22946427edc03?a=0x0bc3807ec262cb779b38d65b38158acc3bfede10#code).\n\n**Example User Experience**\n\nA user connects their wallet — if it’s detected that they own a Noun, a dialog prompts them to create their email address.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/XIriCUL.png)\n\nAfter clicking `Claim email alias` , the page directs them to choose their unique Nouns email address.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/DpLdRUv.jpg)\n\nAfterwards, Nouners will be free to send and receive email from this address.\n\n**Revoking Email Address Ownership**\n\nOne open question is what would happen to an account who sells or transfers his Noun after previously claiming his email address. Because owning a `@nouns.email` email address reflects one’s on-chain identity, it would be reasonable that ownership of this address is lost after losing the underlying Noun.\n\nTo implement this, Ethereum oracles on Skiff would listen for transactions where existing Noun email holders sell or transfer their last remaining Noun. Then, following an optional grace period, the email address would become disabled, becoming unusable until the account owns a Noun again.\n\n## Deliverables and Timeline (Post-PH Update)\n\n**Phase 1A: December 2022 [COMPLETED]**\nAfter Prop House Open Round 13, we successfully implemented the backend endpoints for Nouns Mail. You can view a video demo [here](https://app.skiff.com/docs/fc0a6f99-ebf3-4bfb-b724-6b70ee190103#XW5%2BD4uBTemlPZw4l3hmMaVlSn9npK4frGzDJQg8Bn0%3D) (this test account owns two other NFTs, but not a Nouns and therefore is unable to claim).\n\n**Phase 1B: January 2023**\n\nThe first phase will involve implementation of claiming Noun email addresses with the UX flow described above, including a full integration with the `@nouns.email` domain. We anticipate this taking around 2-3 weeks to fully build, test, and launch. Pending successful execution of the proposal, we are targeting a launch date of **January 20, 2022**.\n\n**Phase 3: February 2023**\n\nIn phase 2, we plan to take an active role in creating Nounish utilities based on Nouns Mail, including newsletters, domain-gated workspaces, and integrating better verification banners for the Nouns forum. We anticipate this process taking around a month, depending on the scope of utilities. We will launch these Nounish utilities as they are created, working actively with the community throughout development.\n\n## Team & Compensation\n\n[Joseph Zhang](https://twitter.com/trader___jo) - Designer, currently at Skiff and Azuki.

All included for free.\n\n ![](https://i.imgur.com/Ycdsn6c.gif)\n\n**The Builder**\n\nI like to think of this Nounish assembler website as one of many stepping stones I’d like contribute towards the future of Nounish games, for game enjoyers as well as for game creators. A creative hub where multiple Nouns collections will be accessible (Lil Nouns, Food Nouns, Sound Nouns, Gnars, etc, etc).\n\nI have many things planned for the future of this builder: the ability to add your own traits and having a sprite sheet drawing app baked into the site to make Noun game asset development seamless. Eventually, I’d like to make this site a place where artists can come to draw, host, share, and support Nounish sprite sheet collections.\n\nSky is the limit with the future functionality of animated Nouns and this proposal represents the first step on the stairway to Nounish Sprite Sheet heaven!\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n**Deliverables**\n\n- Sprite sheet art for every asset of the nouns collection (424) with new traits (159+) , for walking, idle and jumping animations. That's approximately 76,800 individual frames!\n- A website where anyone can easily generate sprite sheets for their games, or preview and download animations for a noun. \n- Easy to use features such as a Randomise button, to generate unlimited animated nouns. \n- Two view modes on the builder: sprite sheet overview and animation preview.\n- Keyboard shortcuts (arrows to move, spacebar to jump) to test animations while in preview mode\n- A video introduction to sprite sheets and how to use them in games.\n- Immediate in Worldwide Webb in collaboration with their team as soon as the assets are finalized.

They’re a collection of single frame animations, laid out like a film strip.

We will create NounsClub, a social platform dedicated for verified Nouns.\n\n**Why?**\n\n* To connect Nouns holders around the world by location\n* To connect with Nouns holders during your travels\n* To potentially integrate Lil Nouns and other collections, based on Nouns community demand\n* To create profiles of Nouns holders online, show their bio and experience to promote the brand\n* To promote the Nouns brand by strengthening the community and showing it’s value to the crypto world\n* To be able to build together and share knowledge and interests according to their professions [ENTREPRENEUR, DESIGNER, INVESTOR, FOUNDER, DEVELOPER, UX DESIGNER ETC].\n* To organize and meet at events and local meetings\n* To be able to see what projects other Nouns are working on and collaborate on them\n* To be able to chat with other Nouns in chat rooms of all kinds\n* To create a large gallery of Nouns event photos and build the story of the community together.\n\nTo grow …\n\nIn order for Nouns to grow to its full potential, the community must grow first and foremost, the holders must have strong ties. This also increases demand for Nouns, as new potential holders want to belong to a vibrant community that has a lot to offer.\n\n**Our motivation**\nOur goal is to bring the Nouns community together, both online and offline, and help them extract maximum community value from the NFTs they hold. We offer them a social platform tailored to their specific needs that the current social media platforms don’t meet.\n\n**Our success story**\nAs of today, we have built two rapidly growing twin platforms, [PunksClub](https://www.punksclub.io), bringing together verified CryptoPunks holders, and [ApeClub](https://www.apeclub.ai), for BAYC/MAYC holders.\n\nOur efforts in numbers (5 months, fully organic growth):\n\n800+ verified CryptoPunk, BAYC, MAYC holders registered on our platforms\nOver 200 Punk & Ape holder meetings IRL thanks to our map feature\n70 holders’ projects listed on PunksClub and ApeClub\n3 events for Punks & BAYC sponsored and organized by us (London, NYC, Miami)\nOur platform will need some adjustments to be rolled out for Nouns, however it’s already live on the market, so there is no execution risk involved.\n\n**NounsClub**\n\nThe only such platform that brings together Nouns holders in one place and gives them the tools to communicate, collaborate, integrate irl. :point_down:\n\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Xg5EvhY.png)\n\nThe interactive map of Nouns holders.

On-chain execution can be coordinated with an added layer of curation/search to simplify these otherwise complex trades. Interested in a noun for 100 lil nouns + 15ETH?  Looking to swap your punk for two nouns? Looking to pay additional WETH to trade your higher noun ID for a sub-100 ID? These trades can be posted to the atomic0 exchange with no fees, be executable by anyone, and can all be open at once until one of them is filled.\n\n**Today, there is no NFT-to-NFT exchange, only OTC trading tools. Nouns can enable this radically new style of trading, which is uniquely possible with NFTs while incentivizing Nouns proliferation.**\n\n## The proposal\n\nAcross the entire swap exchange experience, the benefits of Noun-involved trades are highlighted:\n\n![https://atomic0.com/images/external/nouns-prop-2.png](https://atomic0.com/images/external/nouns-prop-2.png)\n\nThe atomic0 team will use funding from this proposal to meet the deliverables and timeline (below) **and guarantee zero-fee swaps where Nouns + derivatives are involved for the lifetime of the atomic0 exchange**. Where Nouns swaps are found throughout the experience, for example, on an individual punk page with a Noun-involved swap, the swap is highlighted as being a “Nounish” zero-fee swap. Swaps comprised solely of non-Noun assets (BAYCs, Punks, etc.) will be subject to a 0.5% gross fee on the estimated value of the swap.\n\n### Implementation details and mocks\n\nIndividual punk page with an example of noun proposed bids/swaps:\n\n![https://atomic0.com/images/external/nouns-prop-3.png](https://atomic0.com/images/external/nouns-prop-3.png)\n\nAsset selection:\n\n![https://atomic0.com/images/external/nouns-prop-4.png](https://atomic0.com/images/external/nouns-prop-4.png)\n\nThe swap creation page post-asset selection:\n\n![https://atomic0.com/images/external/nouns-prop-5.png](https://atomic0.com/images/external/nouns-prop-5.png)\n\n### Considerations\n\n- **No fees, ever, where Noun or Noun derivatives are included in swaps for the lifetime of the exchange.**\n- An infinite number of swaps can be created (using Seaport) without the NFTs leaving your wallet until an order is filled.\n- Supports multi-sig ([Safe](https://safe.global/)) from day 1.\n- Opensea “Marked as stolen” support/warning.\n- The exchange utilizes Seaport (and the Opensea conduit, so no approvals, if approved on OS), and NFTs don’t leave your wallet until a swap is executed.\n- We **plan to bootstrap with Nouns DAO funding and provide benefits to the Nouns DAO with our no-fee swap product. We plan on a sustainable long-term roadmap via fees (0.5%) on other collections where Nouns are not involved in trades (e.g., Wrapped Punks to BAYC)**\n- Additional proposals/products are possible with fee distribution back to the treasury after we’ve cut our teeth.\n- atomic0 is not yet VC-backed and is wholly founder-owned and operated.\n\n### Our Story with Nouns/web3\n\nWe launched a proof of concept zero-fee NFT marketplace which was the first on Ethereum to have both zero fees and [optional royalties (back in June)](https://twitter.com/atomic0Trade/status/1542282578291372032). Several Nouners used it to field OTC interest in their NFTs, but notably, [ayyybee used it to sell Noun #227](https://twitter.com/a0reverserekt/status/1565441676365029379), and [**vapeape (nounder) used it to sell his V1 Cryptopunk**](https://twitter.com/a0reverserekt/status/1563972653119025152). Many other traders and collectors in the space have executed trades on the platform, including [Franklin](https://twitter.com/franklinisbored/status/1574193716809662464), who actively lists his apes on [atomic0.com](https://atomic0.com/). While I don’t yet have a Noun, I’m [still closely watching and bidding on the auctions](https://twitter.com/robertjfclarke/status/1582833840447332353). Last month, we also built the [first WETH, non-custodial bidding solution for punks](https://twitter.com/atomic0Trade/status/1606001795985453057). This proposal was made possible with Noun delegations by [cryptopunks.eth](https://twitter.com/cryptopunks_ce) and [brennen.eth](https://twitter.com/brennen_eth). A big thank you to all the Nouns who gave feedback on this prop before it went on-chain!\n\n## Deliverables and timeline\n\n- Upon proposal execution → Noun fees are removed on [atomic0.com](http://atomic0.com) for all Noun listings, including derivatives.\n- Four weeks from proposal execution → Individual Noun to Noun or Noun to Other 721 (wrapped punks, BAYC, etc.) swap creation/execution enabled.\n- Eight weeks from proposal execution → Trait and ID array on the “want” side of trades enabled.\n- Stretch goal → Automated recurring emails with the top swap offers received for your wallet.\n- Stretch goal → Automated price adjustments and bulk swap creation when Seaport 1.2 is deployed on-chain.\n\n## FAQ\n\n**Why not build this as a stand-alone Nouns-specific website (e.g., nouns-swaps.com)?**\n\n- **We’ve seen project-specific marketplaces come into the fold recently, such as [Apecoinmarketplace](https://www.apecoinmarketplace.com/collections/0xbc4ca0eda7647a8ab7c2061c2e118a18a936f13d) and [nounish.market](https://www.nounish.market/collections/0x9c8ff314c9bc7f6e59a9d9225fb22946427edc03). The utilization is near-zero compared with generalized marketplaces (Opensea, Looksrare, etc.). Embedding the aforementioned noun-specific benefits into the larger atomic0 swap ecosystem will incentivize and propagate nouns more than isolating noun swaps onto a Noun-only exchange. In other words, if people can also use the platform to trade their punks for apes, there’s a higher chance of Noun propagation due to incentives (no fees) for Noun-involved trades.**\n\nHow does this contrast with [Proposal 46 (Marketplace Pod Proposal)](https://nouns.wtf/vote/46)?\n\n- Our roadmap is entirely centered around enabling NFT to NFT trading, a stretch goal of proposal 46 ([noun.market](https://noun.market/)). Our deliverables focus on NFT to NFT, which makes for minimal overlap with [noun.market](http://noun.market)’s ETH to NFT focus. We see noun.market as complementary in some areas, including derivative identification for collection no-fee designation.\n\nWen open source?\n\n- We intend to open-source many components over time to allow for community contributions to the product, specifically on the front end. This will happen as we enable on-chain order creation and other helpful functionality throughout the development.\n\nHow does this contrast with existing OTC tools such as NFTTrader, Sudoswap OTC, and Swap Kiwi?\n\n- The websites mentioned above are great for situations where you’ve already found a counterparty for your swap. For example, you own a Noun, have fielded interest on Discord, and have found someone to swap your Noun for a punk. We take it up a notch with an exchange-style format allowing you to field interest across many collections and NFTs simultaneously. You could make the same noun swap offer to 100 punks of your liking, all at once, and have them all open and executable on-chain until someone fills the swap. We also support trait, collection, and ID-array bids and have many added layers of discoverability for swaps.\n\n![https://atomic0.com/images/external/nouns-prop-6.png](https://atomic0.com/images/external/nouns-prop-6.png)\n\nWill this require ongoing Nouns funding for maintenance?\n\n- Nouns support will sustain the platform's development through our roadmap mentioned above. Until fee-generating swaps from other collections, such as BAYC (where Nouns aren’t included), can sustain ongoing costs to operate the exchange. We may put through other proposals to add additional functionality or for long-term operational support, depending on community interest in the exchange.\n\nDo you have a plan for on-chain swap storage?\n\n- Off-chain swap storage is cheaper to implement and doesn’t require additional helper contracts, so we’re prioritizing them here for our MVP. We are open to implementing on-chain swap listings depending on the appetite, utilization, and community feedback. Fortunately, Seaport does allow for the storage of order hashes in their contract, so there is undoubtedly a path to implementation.\n\n## Team\n\n- [atomic0](https://twitter.com/atomic0trade)\n- [Robert](https://twitter.com/robertjfclarke) (co-founder)\n- [Alex](https://twitter.com/kiwi_dream) (co-founder)\n\n## Funding Logistics\n\n29 ETH to 0x12f3da22832ade66d63c624b8c40726db1124faf (atomic0.eth, a multisig controlled by Robert and Alex)","proposer":"0x7898fd5d80b52F6d8A9B7a8B908185536650f108","startBlock":16407907,"endBlock":16443907,"executed":false},"votes":[{"support":1,"voter":"0x7898fd5d80b52F6d8A9B7a8B908185536650f108","numberOfVotes":3,"reason":""},{"support":0,"voter":"0x36A5Bc205DF1ED65C86301022cfc343a6ce546ff","numberOfVotes":2,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x696ed7b26f4B019CEeC78DC8b9140ad64A6f354B","numberOfVotes":11,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x4D200d3e268B4A33a831e7ba58aCdF93eA79A1e5","numberOfVotes":2,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0xb4496906D6EA2685E7A46A14BAEfae9fe3bF0D2f","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0xa903C06BF35286f6d1cDAD25396748353979a44C","numberOfVotes":2,"reason":"I like this.

Will there be a wooden effigy of Noun 0 burned IRL at Burning Noun? *Read on to find out.* \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/eZtVziA.png)\n\nSetting the **NounsOTG 2023 Event Calendar** at the beginning of the year will allow other builders to have a solid foundation of nounish proliferation hot spots for the year. In order to capture the content to make the feeling of these experiences available for everyone, NounsOTG will produce a Docuseries that focuses on the organization and activation of each event.

People will be able to participate in these shows regardless of being at the event or not, further connecting the nounish community with the IRL OTG world of Nouns.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/krMaqJz.png)\n\nNouns On The Ground has been highlighting people, places, things and ⌐◧-◧ for the past 6 months. A more in depth look at these past 6 months On The Ground can be found at the end of this Proposal and on the NounsOTG [TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/@nounsotg), [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCS_phF_niMXOADdx694y68w) & [Twitter](https://twitter.com/NounsOTG). These are all great places to DYOR! There are separate forums (164) to discuss each NounsOTG event and each NounsOTA episode in the brand new NounsOTG [Discord](https://discord.gg/nousnotg); meant to be a hub for OTG conversations for each event and podcast.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/YWv961K.png)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/bPxRTim.png)\n\n**⌐◧-◧ Deliverables Upon Completion of the Proposal (one year):**\n* Proliferation of Nouns at 18 different major NFT/Crypto and Social events.\n* Nouns On The Ground in 17 different cities worldwide.\n* Larger nounish activations at NFT Paris, ETH Denver and NFT Toronto.\n* Dedicated nounish activation and art installation at Burning Man 2023.\n* Coverage of each event posted to the NounsOTG social media suite.\n* A Docuseries with BTS features of the entire journey over the year of events.\n* 144 Produced Nouns On The Air shows to highlight people, places and things.\n\n**⌐◧-◧ Total Proposal Ask: 520 ETH ($623,986 USDC with 1 ETH = $1,200 USDC)**\n*(An additional 50 ETH is added to the Proposal to account for market volatility while this proposal is being voted on. If the proposal is successfully passed, the ETH amount will be converted to $623,869 USDC.

In addition to being at each event, this Proposal will focus on larger sponsorships and event activations at 4 of these events. Please observe the budget breakdowns for these specific events below. \n\n\n**⌐◧-◧ OTA TOTAL BREAKDOWN: $61,200 USDC** for Nouns On The Air (NounsOTA) to produce 144 live podcasts over the course of the event calendar, one year, to supplement the \"On The Ground\" activations by highlighting people, places and things during the entire process.\n\nTo view these numbers outlined below, click [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iTdA1xEyf0piU7qukH934zjli4HIH61OJT2_DWhJo5g/edit?usp=sharing).\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/ysXjah3.png)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/zfdIGFm.jpg)\n\n\n**⌐◧-◧ Nounifying Crypto and NFT Native Events**\nAll events in green above are Crypto/NFT native events. These activations will include nounish giveaways, interviews with event participants and spreading the Nouns meme in a variety of different ways based on the type of event. QR Codes, POAPs and social media analytics will be used to measure reach and provide more information attached to specific events/campaigns. For more examples of this type of OTG proliferation, please reference the Prop 110 Case Studies at the end of this Proposal. \n\n**⌐◧-◧ Nounifying Popular Social Events**\nAll events in pink above are social events. In addition to NFT/Crypto native events, NounsOTG will attend and Nounify prolific social events that are in alignment with Nouns branding and the larger brand recognition that we could obtain this year. These social events include Noun by NounWest, Nounchella, Cannes Film Festival, Tribeca Film Festival, Burning Noun and SXSW Sydney. For more examples of this type of OTG proliferation, please reference the Prop 110 Social Experiments at the end of this Proposal. \n\n**⌐◧-◧ Travel Costs - Flights & Accommodation**\nThese costs cover 2-3 airline tickets (depending on the size of the event) to events, insurance and checked bag fees. For each event, the travel expenses/airline ticket price was calculated with 10% added to the total cost to account for price changes over the next several weeks during the Proposal process. Accommodation is covered at each event for Aubtoshi and production crew members. For each event, the accommodation price was calculated with 10% added to the total cost to account for price changes over the next several weeks during the Proposal process.\n\n**⌐◧-◧ Transportation/Per Diem Costs**\nDuring OTG activations, costs accrue around each activation and social event including transportations or \"Uber costs\" as well as food for working team members, water and other toiletries or event supply items that might need to be purchased. An industry standard of $100 per diem per person on the ground covers these costs. These specific costs are calculated at the price of 2 individuals receiving per diem per day on the ground.\n\n**⌐◧-◧ SWAG - Merch & Giveaways & Activations**\nSWAG is anything that the NounsOTG team will be giving away as a brand tool during these activations. This includes stickers, T-shirts and other nounish items. NounsOTG has an ongoing relationship with builders in the DAO to ensure that these items come from builders who work within the ecosystem.\n\n**⌐◧-◧ Aubtoshi, Production & Administrative Costs**\nAubtoshi's payment for NounsOTG management on Prop 110 was $3,600 per month to manage 6 major events over 6 months. With the amount of events doubling on this Proposal, Aubtoshi's NounsOTG management and expertise to do so will double to ensure full time focus on each of these OTG events. Production costs are paid on a per event basis and cover capturing content while OTG, editing and distributing the content over the various OTG social media channels. Administrative costs cover the management of calendars, shipment tracking, live production schedule management, vendor coordination, and overall schedule and time management of NounsOTG events and activations.\n\n**⌐◧-◧ NounsOTG x Activations** All events in yellow above are the main activations. These 4 main OTG activations in 2023 are NFT Paris, ETH Denver, NFT Toronto and Burning Noun. NounsOTG has laid out the budget for each of these events below:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/9rQ4QVu.png)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/BU64XhJ.png)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/FydwNMI.png)\n\n**⌐◧-◧ NFT Paris** is holding its second annual NFT event. After selling out a smaller venue last year, the team has more than doubled down with the iconic Grand Palais, which sits right across from the Eiffel Tower. John Hammon's successful nounish activation throughout Paris, France helped bring new crypto users to the forefront, all with their eye on attending this event. Aubtoshi is already approved as a speaker. Our budget would account for a shared Platinum Sponsorship with Poap.fr (same level as Ledger), items needed for a booth activation, a speaker slot and a budget to throw a smaller/more intimate activation to celebrate the end of this event. We will begin immediately implementing a production schedule of this event if this Proposal is successfully passed. ([event website](https://www.nftparis.xyz/))\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/IM6GcVO.png)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/CVVtO2L.png)\n\n**⌐◧-◧ ETH Denver** takes over the entire downtown Denver, Colorado area for a week to celebrate and educate event goers on NFTs, crypto and the web3 space in general. This event is known for having a jam packed daytime schedule with few social event options in the evening. NounsOTG has the opportunity to sponsor and produce an artist focused social event for 1-2 days during the event. The private location (think giant warehouse with open walls for artists) is on hold with nounish friends and we will begin immediately implementing a production schedule of this event if this Proposal is successfully passed. ([event website](https://www.ethdenver.com))\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/M20WGMA.png)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/E9eLgNq.png)\n\n**⌐◧-◧ NFT Toronto** is another first annual event celebrating the increase in NFT and crypto native users in the Toronto, Canada area. One of the founders is involved with the Solana Nouns team and is determined for this event to be nounish. Budgets account for sponsorship opportunities and the chance to create a social, interactive nounish experience. *(website launching soon)*\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/tZGrDlw.png)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/NuKAAhk.png)\n\n**⌐◧-◧ Burning Noun (Burning Man)** is an event known by people from around the world as one of the most dynamic and unique art festivals in existence. For one week, an entire city is formed with the center point being a wooden structure called \"The Man\". All attendees are encouraged to participate by creating art cars and wooden structures of their own that can be ceremoniously burned at the end of the event. We want to have a focus on Burning Man as a proof of concept for larger event participation in purely socially events. We will construct and burn a wooden effigy of Noun 0, releasing energies and paying homage to the origin Noun, while lighting the way towards the future of all Nouns. \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/CXxl9zG.png)\n\n**⌐◧-◧ NounsOTG Multi-sig (3/5 Signature)**\nThe NounsOTG Multi-sig will be a 3/5 signature multi-sig that will disperse funds on a monthly basis based on the timing of each event/prop. All event budgets must be transferred a minimum of two months prior to the event itself. All events that take place in under two months will be transferred immediately upon a successfully passed Proposal. The signers on this Proposal are well versed in the tools used to manage this amount of seperate transactions.\n\n**⌐◧-◧: 0xD16Ac71b7bfF00E01768723Bc0991fCC4b382164**\n\n**⌐◧-◧ Signers:**\n* nounsotg.eth\n* supertight.eth\n* profwerder.eth\n* toadyhawk.eth\n* signed.benbodhi.eth\n\n**⌐◧-◧ First Transactions (activated with successful Proposal):**\n* 570 ETH transferred to the NounsOTG multi-sig upon successfully passed Proposal.\n* $623,986 USDC converted from the total amount of ETH.\n* 1 ETH will be held in the multi-sig to cover any/all transfer fees.\n* All remaining ETH sent back to the NounsDAO Treasury.\n\n**⌐◧-◧ 2023 Releases: Total: $623,986 USDC**\n* Immediate release 01/2023: $129,967 USDC\n* 02/01/2023: $49,810 USDC\n* 03/01/2023: $53,307 USDC\n* 04/01/2023: $83,106 USDC\n* 05/01/2023: $39,476 USDC\n* 06/01/2023: $68,690 USDC\n* 07/01/2023: $39,500 USDC\n* 08/01/2023: $48,970 USDC\n* 09/01/2023: $62,710 USDC\n* 10/01/2023: $16,150 USDC\n* 11/01/2023: $16,150 USDC\n* 12/01/2023: $16,150 USDC\n* Remaining ETH held for Transfer fees sent back to the DAO\n\n**⌐◧-◧ Any Changes In the Multi-Sig Will Be Made Public**\nIf for any reason during the course of this Proposal a Signer needs to step-down and fill their position, all changes made to the signers of the wallet will be made public. \n\n**⌐◧-◧ Event Changes and Cancelations**\nIf for any reason a listed event cancels or postpones to a date that is no longer possible due to schedule conflicts, the signers of the multi-sig can decide if changing the event is possible. If a change is not possible, funds pertaining to that specific event will be sent back to the DAO. All changes that require these decisions will be made public.\n\n**⌐◧-◧ Proposal Transparency & Proposer Accountability**\nNounsOTG wants to be an example of going above and beyond. We believe that reporting has multiple benefits including data generation to assess further involvement with IRL events/activations in the future. It also helps future proposers understand the hard costs associated with IRL events. This prop and supporting documentation can be used as a measurement tool to evaluate future activations of this type. We hope to continue to serve the community and represent Nouns DAO IRL.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/vscI7ar.png)\n\nWhy is NounsOTG the right fit for continued IRL representation of Nouns? [NounsOTG](https://www.nounsotg.wtf) has been operating within the nounish ecosystem for more than 6 months through each of the following on-chain Proposals and NSFW funding rounds:\n\n* NSFW - [NFT NYC 2022](https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/nouns-on-the-ground-nft-nyc-update/1471) (first official activation)\n* On-Chain - [Proposal 110](https://nouns.wtf/vote/110)\n* NSFW - [Michigan University Final Home Game](https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/nounsotg-x-stadium-club-327-charity-beer-garden/2958)\n* On-Chain - [Proposal 166](https://nouns.wtf/vote/166)\n\nIn July 2022, Nouns On The Ground had a successfully passed on-chain Proposal, [Proposal 110](https://nouns.wtf/vote/110), which was designed to proliferate Nouns over the course of 6 months. We have had so many valuable lessons from these experiences that will allow NounsOTG to make this next six months a valuable investment on the DAO's end when it comes to IRL integration of the meme.\n\nThese proposals have allowed NounsOTG to interact with 11 different on-chain proposals within the nounish ecosystem. This has evolved our understanding of how to interact with and educate the public on the Nouns meme and the ecosystem as a whole, while meeting other builders and learning their stories.\n\nWe have included case studies and data sets for the DAO and future proposers. Our learning experience benefits everyone.\n\n**⌐◧-◧ #1 OTG Takeaway From Each Event**\n* Positive Interactions Are Memorable (Los Angeles, California)\n* Repetition Is Key (Hollywood, California)\n* The Meme Is Engaging (Denver, Colorado)\n* Collabs Create Success (New York City, New York)\n* Hackers Build On Nouns (Berlin, Germany)\n* Content Is King (Munich, Germany)\n* Representation Matters (London, England)\n* Fans Make Brands (Ann Arbor, Michigan)\n* NFT Art Is In Pop Culture (Miami Beach, Florida)\n\nPlease refer to the case studies provided for the 6 main events and 3 additional social experiments that were covered within [Proposal 110](https://nouns.wtf/vote/110) as well as the Michigan University event covered by [NSFW](https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/nounsotg-x-stadium-club-327-charity-beer-garden/2958).

The Rose Parade x Rose Bowl is a 10 day OTG activation with key 3 events happening that require venues, coordination of over 15 brand ambassadors, proliferation of thousands of nounish items and travel/accommodation costs for 4 OTG members.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/N67B3GG.png)\n\nIt is important to note that although content creation and dissemination was not outlined in Prop 110 as a deliverable, it became clear to NounsOTG during our first 6 month trial that content capturing and creation are vital when proliferating IRL to create value from the event even after it has been completed. All content you see on these case studies is being scheduled to be distributed on the [NounsOTG YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCS_phF_niMXOADdx694y68w), [NounsOTG TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/@nounsotg) and [NounsOTG Twitter](https://twitter.com/NounsOTG) accounts over the next several weeks to maintain a stream of content while we capture this next phase of material. I have spoken at length about these various events on different Twitter spaces and podcasts  such as [The Noun Square](https://twitter.com/thenounsquare), the [Noun O’Talk Podcast](https://noun-o-talk.cohostpodcasting.com/episodes/nft-nyc-recap-with-juan-hernandez-pixel-noun-142-and-aubtoshi) and the [Nounsfolk Podcast](https://open.spotify.com/episode/77gZtqxYido8xJ2yU0kn8G?si=GMVXlN81SEi12Abd_P6xgQ).\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/kZka8qa.png)\n\n**⌐◧-◧ Note From Aubtoshi**\nThank you to NounsDAO, Nounders, Nouners and all of the sub communities who make up any part of any one vote within the DAO.

Everyone I have talked to who has met Aubotshi speaks very highly of her. It seems she gets Nouns, is a great ambassador, and is worth taking the risk on. \n- When it comes to spreading the meme, I think time is value.

Our first Nouns DAO offering will be to create and craft a premium, 3-year old Nouns Whisky. Our model is sustainable and returns a percentage of profits back to the DAO.\n\nThere are distilleries around the world that have whisky (distilled twice) or whiskey (distilled 3 times) in their warehouses ready to be sold in a barrel or a bottle format to anyone that can then slap a label onto the bottle, create a concept around it and call it your own. This is awesome and is easily accessible for any builder to start something overnight, but why do that if you have the infrastructure, patience and expertise to create something that is authentic and entirely new. This product is then born with the help of the community and collectively we can watch our creation mature, flourish and proliferate over a span of 3 years, and then watch as it leaves the distillery for the real world to take on a life of its own as it finds its way to your home, bar or restaurant.\n\nThis project will first take shape with an oak barrel, and Whisky barrel or cask trading is becoming more popular across the world and is considered a better investment in the long-run as whisky is an appreciating asset and therefor probably more valuable down the line than most of the nft projects that you have floating around in your wallet and hidden folder. With Nouns Whisky we’re making it easy, with less barriers to entry, so that anyone with 0.35 Eth in their wallet can buy 1 of 500 barrels of whisky (25L / 6.6 Gallons) on OpenSea. Your whisky barrel will be stored securely in the warehouse and is now tied to your wallet address. This is the beauty of provenance and PBT (physically backed tokens) that record your purchase and ownership on the blockchain.\n\nOk, you now own a barrel of whisky in a beautiful city in Cape Town, South Africa. You probably haven’t visited our country, you can’t see your barrel of whisky in person, but you’re excited to own something that is actually tangible, real and valuable. So now you must hodl your nft as the whisky ageing process takes 3 years until it is ready to be bottled and shipped. This is why we’ll be installing a live camera feed in the warehouse and doing quick vlogs during the setup phase so that Nouners can watch us start this journey together. And remember you have a cool as f**k, 1 of 1 Nouns Barrel Head artwork that represents 1 of 500 Nouns Whisky barrels in the warehouse, this is ground breaking for the ecosystem! With everyones help this could possibly be the best long-term investment that you’ll make in Web3 in 2023 and only for roughly $450. But the real question is, can your paper hands become diamond hands and hold onto this token until the next bull run?\n\nAnd now to introduce ourselves. Hi guys, my name is Pierre and I’m the Project Manager for Nouns Whisky, South Africa and this is Andre the Master Distiller, he has won various awards and has been distilling Whisky for 7 years. We’re both makers, builders, love Nouns, everything Web3 and we’re asking for an investment of 102 Eth to create the first of many Nouns Whisky projects over the next 7 years until we reach 2030 when we can release a 7-year old premium whisky born from the Web3 treasury of the Nouns DAO. We will keep 5 barrels aside for this, as it is the perfect goal for us to collectively pursue with ‘One Noun, Every Day, Forever’ on the blockchain. We believe in the ethos of for Nouns by Nouners and then inviting newcomers to join us. This project is our contribution to the Nouns virtuous cycle and a global cultural revolution. We invite you to take a look at our sustainable proposal & vision, and please feel free to ask us any questions in the Nouns Whisky Discord or Discourse with links below, let’s make this happen and do something cool in the consumables category! \n\n*Jim Beam x Mila is the perfect campaign to sum up our Nouns Whisky project in 30 sec and honestly, we didn't even know this advert existed until a few weeks back, as the collaboration was launched in 2015. Similar ads can be created for future nounish whisky content.*\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/aPhKvxE.jpg)\n\nMila x Jim Beam Promo Video: [Click To Watch On YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NHOjInxqdY)\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n**Financially what do we need to make this concept come to life? Let’s break it down simply:**\n\n- 10 Eth for production management costs, merchandising, design & local content creation.\n- 20 Eth for global marketing, strategic partnerships & paid advertising over 24 months (This amount will be held in a wallet, in Eth and deployed as needed).\n- 20 Eth for 100 oak barrels, spirits & labor. These are owned by Nouns DAO.\n- 52 Eth for the facility infrastructure that will produce & house the barrels for 3 years (This amount will be converted to USD/ZAR and kept in a South African bank account that can be viewed upon request by the DAO as it will be used to pay monthly expenses over a period of 36 months).\n\nTotal ask: 102 Eth (in-depth breakdown below Q&A)\n\nIf you have any questions that aren’t posted here please reach out and post them for us to answer: [Comment on Discourse.](https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/nouns-whisky-12-jan-onchain-prop-sponsored-by-nouncil/3553) \n\n\n---\n\n**Questions & Answers**\n\n1. **When will the project launch:** If approved, on the 15th of February 2023 we’ll have the soft launch on OpenSea. This project has been in the works for 6 months, if approved we're ready to roll.\n2. **How many barrels are owned by the Nouns DAO?** = 100 barrels / Nfts\n3. **How many barrels are up for sale to the public?** = 400 barrels / Nfts\n4. **How many bottles are there in a barrel?** = 40 (500 ml, 16,9 oz)\n5. **What is the barrel nft price?** = 0.35 eth (roughly $450)\n6. **Is there a creator royalty?** Yes, 5% (2.5% to Nouns DAO, 2.5% to Nouns Whisky)\n7. **Is there a Whitelist?** No, first come first serve.\n8. **Can I re-sell my barrel nft?** Yes, you can do this at anytime in the next 3 years or the holder can enter a storage agreement with the Distillery and the Whisky can age further.\n9. **Can I re-sell my bottles in 2026?** Yes, as separate nfts in a new collection that we’ll open on OpenSea.\n10. **Will the barrels ever leave the warehouse?** No, only bottles will be shipped to the buyer that requests to do so.\n11. **In 2026 how do I redeem my bottles?** You’ll burn the barrel Nft to redeem them. Fun fact, barrel makers actually do char the barrels.\n12. **Do I pay for duty costs, shipping, postage & final packaging of the bottles in 2026?** Yes, these costs will be calculated in 2026.\n13. **Can my bottles be shipped worldwide?** Yes, besides Antartica & the metaverse.\n14. **Do I have to be of a legal age to buy a Nft tied to a barrel of whisky?** Yes\n15. **Does the distillery have the licensing to sell the barrels to the public?** Yes\n16. **Do you have to be of a legal age to consume the whisky?** Yes\n17. **Do you have to present identification when claiming your bottles:** Yes\n18. **Is this financial advice?** Definitely not. DYOR. Google whisky cask investments.\n19. **Is this going to be a lot of fun?** Hell Yes!\n20. **What is the flywheel & virtuous cycle?** Besides the 100 barrels that the Nouns DAO owns, it will receive an additional 10% of the net income of the Nouns Whisky sales from the 400 barrels on OpenSea. We will also open a Nouns Whisky Instagram, Twitter, Website & Newsletter. We will continue to keep on making more Nouns Whisky Barrels year by year and start a Nouns Gin & Vodka brand down the line.\n21. **What is the proliferation process?** By creating hype around the whisky project on a global scale with paid advertising and strategic partnerships. We will also introduce South Africa to the Nouns ecosystem by starting with the Whisky project and then branching off into other R&D opportunities. \n22. **Are we a Nouns Whisky DAO?** Not at the moment, this could be something that we introduce down the line once we have the basic Nouns Whisky infrastructure in place.\n23. **Are we a Nouns Whisky Bar?** A small one yes, we will host a pop-up bar every 3rd month at the distillery with a live feed so Nouners can tune in.\n24. **What is our Nouns Whisky Club?** This will be a project that we will introduce in Q3 of 2023.\n25. **Do we own the Nouns Whisky or Whiskey names?** No, we encourage other distilleries to create their own versions and join the global community.\n26. **Will we be making Whisky for other DAO's?** No, we're doing this exclusively for Nouns.\n27. **Is this Probably Something in 2023?** Most definitely! \n\nWith all the love & effort going into this project, it is a community endeavour and we plan to work with Nouns builders & content creators, the general community and anyone that wants to join us on this exciting journey to create this high-end luxury Nouns product that you can hand down to further generations if you have diamonds hands!\n\n*And remember: ‘Whisky’ derives from the Gaelic term usquebaugh which translates as ‘water of life’ and Nouns are the seeds of Web3 that we can help grow and prosper through this project for years to come.*\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/FYLg5Zu.png)\n\n---\n\n**NOUNS WHISKY ⌐◨-◨ : The In-Depth Business Details.**\n\n---\n\n**1. The inception and execution is broken down into 6 x Phases.**\n\n***Phase 1 - Nouns Nfts - January & February 2023***\n\n* 500 Barrel Heads are designed & generated and uploaded to OpenSea manually. No minting site. View the first batch here: [Nouns Whisky Barrel Nfts](https://opensea.io/collection/nouns-whisky-barrels)\n* Nft sales / claiming starts on the 15th of February 2023 with a soft launch.\n* The DAO holds 100 barrels and can decide how these are allocated.\n* The distillery holds 400 barrels and these will all be sold to the public at 0.35 eth each.\n* The project does not need to sell all of the Nfts at the soft launch as this is an ongoing project.\n\n***Phase 2 - February & March of 2023***\n\n* The Pienaar & Son Distillery will source and acquire the 25L Oak Barrels.\n* A 3-year lease on a storage facility will be negotiated and locked down for 36 months.\n* Sin tax licensing will be registered for the project.\n* Insurance for the barrels will be setup.\n* A security company will be contracted to make regular rounds at the facility during the projects lifespan.\n* Employment of labor will be needed to set the barrels up in the storage facility.\n* Public Liability insurance will be set up for the labourers & potential visitors.\n* A pallet jack will be bought to move the barrels, bottles & liquid around in the facility.\n* Liquid for the whisky barrels will be produced.\n* Holding tanks (2x200L + 2x500L) will be acquired for the facility.\n* Internet & a permanent computer is set up in the storage facility.\n* A camera is installed in the storage facility so that anyone can view the process of the barrels being set up via the Pienaar & Son website.\n* The distilling of the whisky barrels starts in mid April.\n\n***Phase 3 - March & April of 2023***\n\n* Provenance / ownership of the barrels will be recorded with the Nfts ID and these Nfts can be re-sold from the launch date over the span of 36 months until the whisky is ready to be bottled in 2026.\n* A press release will be compiled explaining the collaboration between the Nouns Dao project & the Pienaar & Son Distillery.\n* This will be sent out in late March to various news outlets across South Africa and to select Nft, whisky, food & beverage news websites.\n* A more in-depth Nouns Whisky website will be created.\n\n***Phase 4 - May 2023***\n\n* 4 x Small events will be held at the distillery with Nouns memorabilia on display.\n\n***Phase 5 - June 2023 onwards***\n\n* The barrels will be monitored by the distillery over the coming months and updates will be added to the Nouns Whisky website for all holders to see.\n\n***Phase 6 - March / April / May / June 2026***\n\n* The whisky will be ready to be bottled & packaged for the Nouns DAO & the public holders.\n* 40 x (500 ml) bottles will be available from each barrel, also accounting for liquid evaporation over 36 months.\n* The owner of the barrel will then be able to ship these bottles to a specified destination across the world. P&P / Shipping will be for the holders cost. Or the holder can enter a storage agreement with the Distillery and the whisky can age further. \n* If the holder chooses to redeem their barrel and put their 40 bottles up for individual sales on our OpenSea page, this is an option.\n\n---\n\n**2. Nouns Whisky South Africa Project Costs:**\n\nFor this project to proceed, upfront costs are necessary to create the Nouns Whisky infrastructure and to produce the liquid. We are asking for 102 Eth with the aim for the DAO to recoup this investment through their 100 Nft sales if they choose to do so. Pienaar & Son have a proven track record in running a profitable alcohol business for over 7 years.\n\nWhy have we chosen Nouns Whisky as the product that will kick-start Nouns proliferation in South Africa? Sustainability is the answer. Alcohol products have played a fundamental role in supporting and helping to pioneer the art & music scenes across South Africa over the last 20 years, and now with this business plan Nouns can join the playground.\n\n**20 ETH ~ WHISKY PRODUCTION**\n\nThe bulk purchases here will be made in the first 2 months of the project.\n\n* Purchase Oak barrels (100 guaranteed to be produced for the DAO)\n* Produce new-make spirit to fill the oak barrels. The oak + ageing time is what gives whisky its characteristic flavour.\n* Depending on public sales, the additional barrels will be purchased and liquid distilled.\n\n**52 ETH ~ FACILITY & LEGAL**\n\nThese expenses will be kept in an account that can be viewed upon request by the DAO as it will be used to pay monthly expenses over the 36 months. Transparency with this spend is important to us. \n\n* 3 Year storage facility lease\n* 2 Month rental deposit fee\n* Storage facility insurance for 3 years\n* Liquor licensing & legal fees for 3 years\n* 4 x Holding tanks\n* 1 x Pallet jack\n* Wooden shelving for the barrels\n* Security fees for 3 years\n* Labor \n* Public Liability insurance for 3 years\n* 1 x Computer and hi-res camera setup\n* High-speed internet rental for 3 years for live facility feed\n\n**10 ETH ~ PROJECT PRODUCTION**\n\nThese expenses are part retro-funding and will be split between Pierre, Andre and the specific suppliers need in the first 2 months. We have been extremely frugal with these line items to reduce the overall production costs. Please note that the R&D process to introduce Nouns to South Africa started in June 2022.\n\n* 2 Month Nft design & brand development fees\n* 6 Months design & South African marketing material fees\n* 6 Months social media fees\n* 6 Months project management fees\n* 1 Months PR agency fees for the Press Release\n* 4 x Eventing fees in June 2023\n* Basic website development\n* 150 x Nouns t-shirts & tote bags (given away for free at the distillery)\n* Photographer for content creation\n* Accounting fees for tax declaration\n\n**20 ETH ~ GLOBAL MARKETING, PAID ADVERTISING & STRATEGIC PARTNERSHIPS**\n\nPlease note, this amount can be deployed by the DAO in a multi-sig over time, it is not needed upfront. We arrived at this amount after feedback from our discussion in our Nouncil meeting.\n\n- Identify key food & beverage websites and contact them for product reviews and paid advertising over 12 months. \n- Connect with Nft News outlets for reviews and paid advertising.\n- Connect with traditional media outlets for advertorials & press release information.\n- Connect with established builders in the Nouns ecosystem to create paid content for Nouns Whisky.\n- Look at ways to utilise digital billboards with Nouns Whisky assets.\n- Get Nounish studio involved to create some video content.\n\n---\n\n**3. How much ROI can the Nouns DAO expect from the Nouns Whisky project?**\n\n- 102 Eth investment\n- Produces 100 barrels for the DAO\n- 40 bottles per barrel = 4000 bottles\n- If the DAO chooses to hold onto all the barrels till 2026. There will be a $100 reserve price per bottle on OpenSea = $4000 per barrel\n- If the DAO sells all 4000 bottles in 2026/2027 at $100 each that = $400 000 = 300 Eth at todays price of $1 333,25 from an 102 Eth investment. This is a best case scenario but conservative at $100 auction price per bottle. \n- If the DAO sells all 100 barrels at 1 Eth each, forecasting they reach this price during the 36th month period, the DAO will make 100 Eth to recoup the 102 Eth spend.\n- Besides the 100 barrels that the Nouns DAO owns, it will receive an additional 10% of the net income of the distilleries Nouns Whisky sales from the 400 barrels on OpenSea. This amount will be sent to Maty to record and confirm that the payment has been made once we reach a sold out position.\n- The DAO will also receive a 2.5% royalty from all of the sales on OpenSea in perpetuity (barrels & bottles).\n\n---\n\n**4. Pienaar & Sons Distillery Sales Case Study in South Africa.**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/sHxeklZ.png)\n\nDistillery Promo Video: [Click To Watch On YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9mh-DQYbI)\n\n\nDistillery Location at V&A Waterfront, Cape Town: [View On Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/makerslanding)\n\nDistillery Images + 11.4k Followers: [View On Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/pienaarandson/)\n\nHere is the distilleries current business model and you can see their whisky here: [Tiny Batch Whisky - Heavy Char – Pienaar & Son](https://pienaarandson.co.za/products/tiny-batch-whisky-heavy-char)\n\nPlease note that these figures are based on the distillery already having invested in the infrastructure to create these batches 5 years ago and with 225 litre barrels.\n\n**Cost to produce and store first 2 x (185L after evaporation) Barrels = ± 2.5 Eth (ageing period - 4 years)**\n\nTotal bottles produced = 1100\nBottle retail price in South Africa = 0,032 Eth each\nGross income from bottle sales in South Africa = 35,42 Eth\n**Time taken to sell out = 19 days**\n\n**Nett profit from bottle sales = 23,20 Eth**\n(Ex Advertising) ROI = 994%\n\n*Awards: World Whisky Awards - Single grain, Single cask - Bronze Medal*\n\n\n---\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/COJxx2z.png)\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n**5. So what does this mean in the long-run for Nouns Whisky?**\n\n1) When the Whisky ageing process comes full circle in 2026 we can start selling the whisky across South Africa.\n2) We can offer the Whisky to bars across South Africa.\n3) We can offer the Whisky to music festivals across South Africa.\n4) We can offer the Whisky to major liquor outlets across South Africa.\n5) We can create pop-up bars and sell the Whisky directly to consumers.\n6) With our e-commerce store we can sell bottles directly to customers.\n7) We can offer the product to an international audience. \n\n---\n\n**6. What does this do to create sustainability and proliferation?**\n\n1) Alcohol companies make great margins on their products that creates regular cash flow as alcohol is available to consume 12 months of the year. You can sell the product 365 days a year as it is not a seasonal business plan.\n2) Nouns Whisky can invest financially in music events, artists, musicians and any other strategic partnerships with profit made from sales in South Africa. This is key if you're going to build a brand with the goal of it being sustainable to 2030 and beyond.\n3) With profits the business can also create social responsibility campaigns and donate to charities to do community cleanups and more. \n\n---\n\n**7. Why should Nouns invest in financially sustainable projects.**\n\nThis is an opportunity for Nouns to branch further into the African continent with a sustainable business plan. We can give a % of profits back to the DAO in perpetuity, R&D other product lines and turn the investment into a long lasting brand building endeavour. It is that simple and makes this investment a winning formula.\n\n---\n\n**8. What happens with the project in 2024, 2025, 2026 and onwards so that we can release more products?**\n\nWith the profits that we generate from the sale of the 400 Nouns Whisky barrel nfts we will release another batch of whisky each year that will mature for another 3 years, this will be available to the public again to trade and this will allow the project to remain sustainable without requesting the DAO to fund us each year. We can continue to create more content, on-board new buyers and continue the proliferation of Nouns Whisky and best of all we can continue to produce a 2.5% secondary sales royalty in perpetuity for the Nouns DAO from OpenSea nfts, and 10% of the primary nft barrel sales every year. We will also be looking at R&D opportunities in the coffee & bottled water categories as an additional way to introduce Nouns to South Africa and create a ROI for Nouns DAO.\n\n---\n\n**9.

Our experience in the music industry with alcohol brands.**\n    \nTo strengthen our pitch and to showcase our experience in the alcohol and music industry: here is a music video that we helped produce in South Africa and it has accumulated 7.7 million views. There are key elements that played a role in the creation of this video and first and fore-mostly the Afrikaans band needs to write a song that the nation wants to play on repeat, they hit this for a home run. Alcohol companies sponsor culture and this could easily be a video that Nouns Whisky could have produced as Jagermeister paid for it. We have a lot of opportunities down the line to work with musicians in South Africa.\n\nWe helped the same band release a Vinyl and EP album backed by a physical and collectible box of beers and there was a free album inside. This could have also been a project backed by a Nft. The box of beers was then distributed across South Africa to more than 100 stores where fans could buy the box of beers. There was a limited amount and fans were seen standing outside of the liquor outlets waiting for the stores to open. This is something that Nouns Whisky could have sponsored. I’m using these projects to showcase the power of what an alcohol business & project can do with profits / marketing budget. This is the same model that Jagermeister uses, they sell bottles and use a portion of this income to connect with culture and introduce their brand in countries across the world.\n    \n![](https://i.imgur.com/herO5Pz.jpg)\n\nBand Music Video at Kirstenbosch Botanical Gardens: [Click To Watch On YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TDqNyL2KPQ)\n    \n![](https://i.imgur.com/dS0FyEt.png)\n    \n![](https://i.imgur.com/n7I2Txd.jpg)\n\n---\n\n**11. Summary: Future Plans for Nouns proliferation in South Africa and beyond.**\n\n* Nouns Whisky Club \n* Beverage Website for Nouns products from around the world.\n* Nouns Beverages in South Africa (Beer, Wine, Gin, Vodka, Soda, Water)\n* Nouns Pop-Up Bars\n* Coffee Nouns in South Africa\n* Whisky Coffee / Irish Coffee\n* Barrel Aged Coffee\n* Invest in artists, musicians and events.\n\n---\n\n**12. And to conclude, our Roles & Experience: Andre & Pierre**\n\n***Andre Pienaar:***\n\n* Proposal\n* Master Distiller\n* Facility Management\n* Project Management\n* On-Site Content Creation\n* Merchandise Production\n* Nouns Events\n\n***Pierre Coetzee**:*\n\n* Proposal\n* Project Management\n* On-Site Content Creation\n* Merchandise Production\n* Design Management\n* Nft Management\n* Blockchain Payments Management\n* Nouns Events\n\n***Andre Pienaar:*** [https://pienaarandson.co.za/](https://pienaarandson.co.za/)\n\n*I can confidently say that whisky was always part of the plan, and one of the cornerstone reasons I wanted to start the Pienaar & Son distillery. With the foundation of my fathers’ knowledge of building beautifully sophisticated distillation equipment, and my biochemistry and chemistry degree, I knew we would have a significant advantage in the understanding and manipulation of the fermentation and distillation processes required to produce a world class whisky. There is a lot more at play than making some moonshine and chucking it in a barrel.*\n\n***Pierre Coetzee:*** [https://futurenow.world/](https://futurenow.world/)\n\n*Over a span of 15 years spent in Cape Town & South Africa, active in the skateboarding, music & art scenes: I’ve been fortunate to pioneer and explore these movements through small investments into supporting skateboarders, musicians & artists careers. I’ve been able to work with the majority of the alcohol & lifestyle brands with sponsorship procurement and speciality brand activations & development. Over the past 20 months I’ve navigated the crypto art industry as a creator & collector, following Punk 4156, his journey, the sale of his Crypto Punk and the inception of the Nouns DAO initiative / collective. We’re in a new era of a cultural revolution supported by cryptocurrencies & DAO’s, this is why I’m approaching Nouns DAO to work with Andre and his local Cape Town business as an anchoring point whereby we can start the proliferation of Nouns in South Africa. This is our first sustainable proposal to the DAO and once proven successful, there will be more opportunities to further introduce Nouns to the melting pot of South African and global cultures that reside here. We live in a beautiful country and need to innovate by using the blockchain as a vehicle to help small businesses to thrive and prosper. Nouns Whisky will be the foundation of our collective journey.*\n\n***Brands I’ve collaborated with:** Honda Music Stage, Vans, Converse, Puma, Levi’s, Ray-Ban, Red-Bull, Jagermeister, Jose Cuervo, Olmeca, Smirnoff, Jameson Whisky, Three Ships Whisky.*\n\n***Artists I’ve worked with between 2010 to 2015 in Cape Town as a venue & events manager:** Qbert, Diplo, Steve Aoki, Foals, Public Enemy, DJ Premier, DJ Krush & Seth Troxler. I also helped create and produce a 3 day festival sponsored by VANS titled Endless Daze and helped to launched  a beer brand for one of South Africa's biggest bands.*\n\n***Nouns derivative project:** When we started our journey in June to pitch a prop to Nouns Dao we wanted to first engage with the community and release our own generative collection that would also incorporate some of our creative work, some fun words, other CC0 and iconic web3 projects. We did this by showcasing the designs on the Nouns bodies. This was a challenging project and led us down a rabbit hole as it was the first time that we would do a 10k mint and use a design generator. We had never looked into contracts, how to DIY it and finally stumbled upon NiftyKit and deployed the project as a free mint on Polygon so that the community could collect 20 per wallet and share them with friends.*\n\n***Web3 Projects I've complete:** In 2021 I was the first artist to be featured on the OpenSea homepage as they wanted to pivot into featuring more art and less pfps. This fine art piece of mine was showcased and received 15k views and is still featured on their Twitter banner. As a part of the showcase I also gave away over 150 unique nfts for free to onboard new collectors, free nfts were few and far between at this point in time. So this was a really cool experience and I had the opportunity to meet a lot of new people in the nft community. We then did an unofficial Cool Cats digital beer and if you as a holder bought a 6-pack we would then send you 6 beer nfts with your pfp on it, and people would share it with each other via polygon. We customised just over 100 bottles that got shared around Twitter. Lastly we were able to secure some plots and built 3 x galleries in Decentraland. A very time consuming exercise but a lot of fun!*\n\n\n---\n\nThanks for your time, Andre and I appreciate it and fingers crossed we can collectively get this project approved, it will be an exciting journey for the global Nouns Community starting a new chapter in 2023!\n\n---\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/314OzeI.jpg)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/pPwCydM.png)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/86guZrK.jpg)\n\n---\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/bdF2cgw.png)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/MFmPXN8.png)\n\n---\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/PtfEKdD.png)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/dG1X8WD.png)\n\n---\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/dufRf3R.png)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/4uiZlRa.png)","proposer":"0xcC2688350d29623E2A0844Cc8885F9050F0f6Ed5","startBlock":16444455,"endBlock":16480455,"executed":true},"votes":[{"support":1,"voter":"0x008c84421dA5527F462886cEc43D2717B686A7e4","numberOfVotes":28,"reason":"I'd encourage anyone considering this to look at 87Bones commentary in Jungle Discord.

It uses a \"see good, do good\" format to increase brand equity (⌐◧-◧) and raise awareness through its activations. \n- Mucho Love has also formed an in-real-life community of over 60 active members learning about web3, crypto, and Nouns while participating in helping causes they love. \n-  During the last 6 months, we’ve seen how our work has been spreading a meme and increasing awareness about Nouns in all the people that interact with our content.\n- Mucho Love is requesting 70.86 ETH for a 4 month extension to organize four activations in the Dominican Republic that will have Nouns in their core, organize an event to thank volunteers for their work, and compensate the core team for their work. \n\n\n\n### What is Mucho Love?\n\nMucho Love is a nouns-based social impact platform that was created 6 months ago. Mucho Love started with a Lil Nouns prop.house (https://prop.house/lil-nouns/round-3), then went on-chain on prop 137 for further proof-of-work (https://nouns.wtf/vote/137), and now is back on-chain to keep growing, improving, and experimenting further. \n\nMucho Love is currently working to become a major platform that promotes goodness in the Dominican Republic. A platform powered by ⌐◧-◧. \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/2pdNlcP.png)\n\n\n### What has Mucho Love done? \n\n\n<div style=\"padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;\"><iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/778244189?h=169183d222&badge=0&autopause=0&player_id=0&app_id=58479/embed\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen frameborder=\"0\" style=\"position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;\"></iframe></div>\n\n**Other videos:**\n- https://twitter.com/mucholovedr/status/1606635791593119744\n- https://twitter.com/mucholovedr/status/1565689757740535808\n- https://twitter.com/mucholovedr/status/1595141776867983361\n\n\n### Total impact generated\n\nMucho Love works with a \"see good, do good\" format. A format that uses social impact to incentivize others to do the same. This format allows us to raise awareness of the impacts we're activating and increases brand equity for ⌐◧-◧ .\n\nMucho Love is focused on creating a positive connotation in a society that knows nothing about Nouns. Mucho Love will allow us to establish the ⌐◧-◧ as a goodness symbol within our community.\n\nIn the past six months, **Mucho Love has shared joy, smiles, gifts and a whole lot of love to impact the following**: \n* 750+ Children \n* 300+ Families\n* 100+ Dogs\n* 60+ Volunteers\n* 3 Institutions\n* 1 community\n\n\nAside from social impact and the people impacted, it is crucial to generate attention/awareness on social media to keep growing the platform.\n\nSo far, Mucho Love has:\n* 0 followers to 1700+ on [Instagram](https://https://www.instagram.com/mucholovedr/) (most followed ⌐◧-◧-related account)\n* Generated over 16,000 views from videos ([Twitter](https://https://twitter.com/mucholovedr))\n* Generated close to 70,000 likes throughout all posts (Instagram)\n* Generated over 20,000 views from reels (Instagram)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/gOc2sEw.png)\n****Data from the respective social media platforms mentioned***\n\nContent creation is an essential aspect of the brand building because it helps to establish the brand's identity, communicate its values and message, and engage with its audience. \n\nMucho Love aims to create a positive association with the noggles, show people what's possible to develop with Nouns, and engage with the new audience interacting with ML & Nouns.\n\nSee good, do good content will help us reach a broad audience and funnel people into Nouns, therefore showing them how they can form part of Nouns and start forming part of the community.\n\nWe will use Instagram, TikTok, and Youtube-Shorts to post the generated content.\n\n* **Youtube**: Short video format striving to combine storytelling with good animations, edits, and clips that focus on wholesome emotions.\n* **Tiktok**: Short video formats with catchy hooks with the main point of spreading the ⌐◧-◧s through the platform. Making it easier for people who find the ⌐◧-◧s interesting to click the profile and access other social media where more information will be more easily found (Instagram, Twitter).\n* **Instagram**: So far, Instagram has worked for us pretty well. A few flops and one fantastic post (a post with almost 67,000 likes), but it's been great in general. Instagram plans to be the \"face\" of what ML stands for, does, and activates. We'll also be using challenge formats to engage more people.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/iY7cUIp.png)\n****post link: https://www.instagram.com/p/Ck1eho1vr5Z/***\n\n### A nounish community \n\nDuring the past 6 months, we've formed an in-real-life nounish community of over 60 people. Mucho Love is a community that actively represents what nounish is, understanding it deeply.\n\nIt's been interesting to see how people who knew nothing about web3, crypto, or nouns are now having their curiosity sparked by our activations and the one thing I've constantly been telling them: Nouns funds ideas ⌐◧-◧\n\nDuring the next four months, you'll see Mucho Love community members creating proposals and activating their ideas. Volunteers have been learning about Nouns, Lil Nouns, prop.house, and have already thrown some ideas they'd like to propose. \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Q5EInDR.jpg)\n\n\n\n### The next 4 months\n\nDuring the next four months, Mucho Love will perform four activations within the Dominican Republic.\n\n- **Staffeld x Mucho Love: A Nounish Masterpiece**\n    We'll be going to an orphanage with @staffeld (https://twitter.com/staffeld) to make a fun art competition, \"1 Professional Artist vs. 100 Children\". This event focuses on having children paint their own \"nounish masterpiece\" on a massive canvas with the help of ML volunteers and using the ⌐◨-◨ as the central theme of the activity. **We will also donate Nounish Coloring Books made by Ilustradora and Messhup.**\n- **Nounish Homerun ⌐◨-◨ Baseball/Softball Sponsor**\n    We will be donating baseball/softball uniforms (with the ⌐◨-◨ embroided as the \"sponsor\"), bats, baseballs, softballs, helmets, and gloves. This activation will consist of a game of baseball/softball, Mucho Love Volunteers vs their team. The main impact of this activity is giving children and teenagers the proper equipment to play the sport they love. The equipment donated should last between 3-5 years.\n- **Giving free haircuts for an entire day to an underserved community**\n    We'll be hiring barbers to cut hair for free in one of the most underserved communities in the DR. This event looks to explore how simple things can be so meaningful for humans and to try and have deep conversations with the people from the community.\n- **Knife x Mucho Love: A Nounish Cooking Challenge**\n    We'll be collaborating with a cooking institute in the DR to cook children from orphanages/underserved communities their dream meals. We will donate care packages with food essentials for the families/institution of every child present. We'll be \"nounifying\" the food prepared at this activation.\n\nIn the case that one of the activations can't happen due to any unexpected events, this is the backup activity:\n\n- **Nursing-home: A Nounish Day**\nWe'll be going to an underfunded nursing home to spend a day sharing, eating, and playing with the people who live there. This event aims to connect with an older population and get insights into their experiences, life, and how to live a good, nounish life.\n\nThese activations combine the communities/institutions/people that the Mucho Love community wants to help and the narratives that will generate a lot of attention on social media.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/3cqgI1o.jpg)\n\n\n\n### What value does this bring to NounsDAO? \n\nMucho Love is activating IRL experiences with Nouns at its core. During the last months, we've seen how our work has been spreading a meme and increasing awareness in all people interacting with our content.\n\nMucho Love is also increasing brand equity through social media and the content it produces while creating a positive association and connotation with the ⌐◧-◧. Providing in-real-life activations where people can interact with Nouns physically has immense power.\n\nAside from the evidence (views, awareness, engagement, meme expansion), we can connect humans with experiences and a community representing Nouns. The ML community will only keep growing and growing as the platform itself grows; there's no limit to how big this can get and how much we can get done.\n\nYou can generally explain things by using examples, defining terms, providing visual context, breaking down concepts into smaller parts, and using analogies. Through Mucho Love, people learn through action what nounish is and means. Mucho Love can leverage all of the mentioned ways with its format. We can noun-pill in one of the most organic ways possible by forming part of something meaningful.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/41U2NGC.jpg)\n\n### What does the future of Mucho Love look like?\nML is working to be a platform that expands Nouns to new people, places, and things. Using see-good, do-good content and a growing, engaged community, ML can grow into one of the most influential platforms powered by Nouns. ML is currently testing many ideas, content formats, video styles, and activations. \n\nML is currently testing many ideas, different content formats, different video styles, different types of activations. As we keep experimenting and implementing new ideas I am certain that we will find our correct flow and \"platform fit\". \n\nI (necfas) see ML as a platform that creates opportunities to impact people's lives. ML takes the impact generated to develop content and represent what Nouns is and what it's capable of generating.\n\nWe expect Mucho Love to evolve in the following ways:\n- Longer format videos (Youtube)\n- Grow the volunteering community to over 250 active members by the end of 2023\n- Develop new ways to onboard community members to participate within Nouns\n- Create recurrent activations leveraging the talents of our volunteers (for example, Nounish Medical Operatives every four months)\n- Involve more institutions and businesses to collaborate on the activations.\n\n\n### What's the ask? \n\nA total of 70.86 ETH to fund the following 4 months of activations, part-time marketing/content creation team, and compensation for core team members. \n\n\n- Social Impact Fund - 40.35 ETH\n    - Activations Fund - 36.35 ETH\n    - Volunteer Gratitude Event - 4 ETH (event to thank volunteers for their amazing work)\n- Part-Time Marketing/Content Creation Team- 13.01 ETH\n    - Content Creator (4.18 ETH / 1,462.5 USD per month)\n    - Video Editor ( 6.97 ETH / 2437.5 USD per month)\n    - Community Manager (1.86 ETH / 650 USD per month) \n- Compensation for 4 core team members - 17.5 ETH, in charge of: \n    - Content Vision/Ideation/Business Relationships ([necfas](https://twitter.com/necfas)) - 10 ETH (2.5 per month)\n    - Logistics/Payments ([mimix](https://twitter.com/miagiulianag)) 4 ETH (1 per month)\n    - Outreach (Cristina R.) - 1.75 ETH (0.4375 per month)\n    - Quotations (Marian J.) - 1.75 ETH (0.4375 per month)\n\n**considering 1 ETH = 1400 USD for USD costs*\n**if there's a surplus of USD, we can help even more the communities with the care-package donations, organize another activation, or send it back to the DAO* \n**considering that the [Mucho Love's last prop](https://nouns.wtf/vote/137) was done with 0 compensation, the current activation/admin balance is 65%/35%*\n### Budget breakdown\n![](https://i.imgur.com/QpaSiT3.jpg)\n***costs of the care-packages are determined by costs of items and amount of people involved in the activation**\n\n### Deliverables\n- Completion of 4 IRL activations\n- 20 shorts through all social media platforms\n- 4 Recap videos of every activation\n- 1 Volunteer Gratitude Event \n- 100+ Mucho Love Active Members\n- 2500+ Instagram Followers\n\n### Tx\n\n70.86 ETH to 0xCb2D68C9e7194B9cE0837eE5E676e796CB31C55a (mucholove.eth)\n","proposer":"0x5606B493c51316A9e65c9b2A00BbF7Ff92515A3E","startBlock":16449247,"endBlock":16485247,"executed":true},"votes":[{"support":1,"voter":"0x86030dbbCe1c771Ff6622C20455cd3619aa93c05","numberOfVotes":48,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x55b0a25d697647281553a177321DAd0a0Bf9A148","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":"Good breakdown.

To further expand Nouns global reach, to proliferate nounish culture by creating a lasting nounish impression with an array of activations over a span of 6 months:  \n\n \n1. **Nouns Haus**, a fun one stop shop to proliferate and educate Nouns across 5 NFT/Crypto centric events  \n5. **Nouns Shanghai Carnival**, a OTG activation to solidify proliferation of Nouns & create authentic/memorable connection with general public \n6. **Nounish Digital Collectibles** launched on China's largest social media platform Sina Weibo.\n7. **NounsCN Grant** to expose local creator to Nouns funding system. \n8. **Nouns Go Viral** on Douyin a.k.a Chinese version of TikTok.\n9. **Nouns Chair**, a public structure at Shanghai Himalayas Museum\n10. **Nounish PR Campaign** with both blockchain media (Foresight、PANews、Odaily) and traditional media (Shanghai daily) for the leadup and duration of all Nounish events in China\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/LFZP4jx.png)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/vCzFtnC.png)\n\n\n**Why China?:**\nNFT picked up its popularity in 2021 and this phenomenon continues into 2022; entering mainstream consciousness and China has not been left out. In China, NFT are referred to as \"digital collectibles\" rather than \"token\" and its digital collectibles market has been growing rapidly as chinese young consumers are increasingly embracing digitization.\n\nAccording to TechInSight NFT survey, China digital collectibles spend value will increase from $4.8 billion in 2022 to reach $48.3 billion by 2028. Searches for post related to digital collectibles increased by 1,228% y-o-y, while the number of post related to keyword \"NFT\" rose by 159-fold. \n\nTech giants like Ant Group and Tencent have also ventured into this space and we will be seeing many more Chinese companies/investors jumping onto this bandwagon and they could all be potential DAO members contributing to the DAO, opening untapped channels and ways to proliferate Nouns branding and the meme to a wider/larger market & audiences.  \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Zn1F1hH.png)\n\n**How will this be done?:**\nWe will establish Nouns presence and build its brand/meme awareness in China through activations in multiple domains both online and offline: \n\n**1. Nouns Haus:**\n\nA fun one stop shop focusing on educating and explaining NounsDAO and what it means to be nounish while showcasing what the DAO have achieved till date to event goers; a proliferation engine that will be on-going throughout 5 of China’s major NFT/Crypto centric events like: ***CryptoArt Shanghai***, ***CryptoArt ShenZhen***, ***Beijing Creator DAO Exhibition***, ***8BTC Digital Art Summit***, **WanXiang Blockchain Summit** and so forth over the course of 2023.  \n\nEvent like CryptoArt Shanghai draws in huge pool of participants/audiences yearly, these are people who have interest, understand and looking to contribute to the space thus,\nNouns Haus aim is to:\n- Educate and grab attention from this pool of audience(s), onboarding them as potential DAO contributors\n- Allow this pool of audience(s) to have the chance to understand Nouns\n- Put Nouns in the eyes of thousands of Collectors / Investors / Builders (Devs)\n\nNouns Haus will also be packed with nounish activation(s) like:\n1. **Nouns-branded photo station**, where everyone is able to have photo taking opportunities helping us proliferate the meme to the millions across Weibo and Wechat, China’s main social platform (equivalent to Twitter/Facebook/Instagram). Content over those platforms will be captured by team and shared among the nouniverse. \n2. Display of **Nounish creative tools** like Noundry Studio, where participants are able to have hands-on experience, all while learning about Nouns and the tools the DAO funded/created. \n4. **Nounish graffiti wall** for participants to leave their mark in Nouns Haus.\n5. **Nounish wheel of knowledge**, a *Learn & Earn activation* where participants are able to win nounish swag by answering random questions about NounsDAO (wheel of fortune style) correctly using the information they obtain by interacting in Nouns Haus.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/K3aXi0f.gif)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/qCnrw4w.jpg)\n\n**2. Nouns Shanghai Carnival:** \nThis will be a curated IRL nounish experience aimed to proliferate Nouns branding to **mass public** in China, to help increase awareness of Nouns and put noggles ⌐◨-◨ in the eyes of hundreds.\n\nWe believe that Nouns IRL presence should not only be restricted to Web3.0/NFT events; localized nounish IRL events that break off from the usual Web3.0/NFT audience are equally important.\n\nNouns Shanghai Carnival will be a localized nounish experience held at Shanghai 1933, a historical building that has transformed itself into a cultural epicenter and a national tourism demonstration site. It is ideally located close to 2 rail transit lines, connecting the city’s main roads and is only 1km from the Shanghai luxury cruise terminal and the Hyatt on the Bund. \n\nWhat will be installed (not limited to): \n- Nouns photo station \n- Game stations \n- Food stations\n- Nouns Gallery\n- Nounish swag\n- Nounish lounge area\n- Accessibility to various Nouns platform (nouns.wtf, prop house, nouns center etc)\n\nA QR code will also be distributed during the event for participants to join our community, where they will be given priority in claiming the Nounish digital collectibles. Number of digital collectibles claim through this group would give us a insight on the effect of such IRL events. \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/nKhYwIV.png)\n\n**3. Nounish Digital Collectibles** \nAs the digital collectibles market in China continue to grow rapidly, we aim to work with China's largest social media platform [Sina Weibo](https://weibo.com/newlogin?tabtype=weibo&gid=102803&openLoginLayer=0&url=https%3A%2F%2Fweibo.com%2F) which is a Chinese microblogging website, with over 582 million monthly active users to launch a Nounish collection of digital collectibles on their marketplace.\n\nThis Nounish collection of digital collectibles will be something native and it will facilitate the education of this native community about Nouns & enable the community to discover what it meant to be nounish organically; it is also an on-going exploration of the iconic noggle and its meme value by expanding it into a different domain.\n\nTo unveil and amplify the launch of these nounish collectibles, Sina Weibo will mobilize its media resources to proliferate the collection on top of facilitating the distribution of this collection to its users. This nounish digital collectibles will be free to collect (FCFS), in addition, a meme contest will also be held in parallel with the launch to seed and boost the meme value of noggle/nouns within Chinese digital collectibles communities.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Bmwfpul.png)\n\n**4. NounsCN Grant**  \nNounsCN Grant will be a pilot/experimental pool of small capital that serves the DAO’s interest similar to NSFW and DCS pod, it will be stewarded on a completely discretionary basis.\n\nCurrent funding system like prop house, NSFW & DCS pod are not readily available to the chinese community in China due to their internet censorship, hence NounsCN Grant aim is to serve this gap by taking on the stewardship of distributing grants, to introduce Nouns funding system (small grants, retro funding, trail/pilot) to local creatives/creator by having it on native channel(s) that are readily available to the chinese community.\n\nThe group will conduct its daily operations on Sina Weibo Nouns Chinese community page, 1) it is a platform where proposer could put up their proposal and have it discussed openly, 2) resonate & attract builder within the digital collectible community\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/6KEtEyw.png)\n\n**5. Nouns Go Viral** \nIn this current era the quickest and most effective way to bring millions of new people's attention onto Nouns is none other than creating viral content that helps spread the Nouns meme/brand across the internet. \n\nDouyin, the Chinese version of TikTok, a native social media platform in China has over [700 million daily](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/15/bytedance-douyin-has-600-million-daily-active-users.html) active users and is one of the most popular app in the country; thus by working with Douyin sensation for example like street basketballer “小酷翔”, we aim to generate a series of curated content for at least 2 months where we not only showcase the iconic noggle but also foster interest towards the brand by launching periodic Nounish swag giveaway through various activation/engagement over Douyin and WeChat.\n\np.s 万 = 10,000\np.p.s From just 6 clips, there’s a total of 143.4万 (1.43 millions) views\n\np.s 万 = 10,000\np.p.s From just 6 clips, there's a total of 143.4万 (1.43 millions) views\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/e0WPWiz.png)\n\n**6. Nouns Chair:** \nA huge part of being nounish is to be able to spread the culture and meme through public goods and to do fun & creative stuff; thus, in the spirit of public good we aim to put up a nounish structure in Shanghai by fabricating a Nounish furniture - “Nouns Chair”\n\n“Nouns Chair” design will be heavily influenced by the iconic noggle and 3 of such “Nouns Chair” will be place at Shanghai Himalayas Museum, a non-profit art institution focusing on art exhibition, education, collection and academic exchange with a average of 4,000 monthly visitors.\n\nWhy “Nouns Chair”? As an IRL object of the world, an artistic memeish take on noggle, “Nouns Chair” at the same time is also an instrument proliferating the Nouns branding; it invites museum visitors to sit down, to begin a conversation, provoke them to wonder how this design came about and that itself is fun/nounish. \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/DRHvzoh.jpg)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/buvmhKS.png)\n*2 draft design*\n\n**7. Nounish PR Campaign**\nHave developed a deep network of media partners over the years, leading up to execution of all Nounish activations; we will seed the content and details about Nouns to our media partners (web3 outlets & traditional media outlets). Positive publication coverage would help boost interest and engagement revolving Nouns. \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/GzS8Kff.jpg)\n\n**The Team**\n\n- [Noun 74](https://twitter.com/noun_74) - Founder of Chinese Cryptopunks Community [(CCC)](https://twitter.com/chinese_punks), a community with more than 200 members each of which are verified punk holders. CCC as one of the leading NFT community in China has the highest concentration of web3 thought-leaders, including directors from Christie's and Sotheby's, founders of notable crypto exchanges as well as directors of notable crypto media. \n\n    Noun 74 also spearheaded multiple Web3.0 activations within China; co-hosted events like [Cryptoart Shanghai](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTIMejrYAvE) that was featured on [China national news](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2BX5jNS6-o) as well as multiple [media](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/2UqXwsOzNojdlr2CQ-DfNA) platforms. Recently organized a joint exhibition that is currently on-going till 25th Feb 2023 at Shenzhen China, where [Nouns are being exhibited](https://twitter.com/Nounscn/status/1611272511379111937) alongside other renowned NFT project like Cryptopunks, BAYC etc. \n    \n    Noun 74 also tend to received multiple opportunities where he gets invited to major Web3.0/Crypto events as speaker or host; for example in recent month he was invited to host a roundtable at [Web3 Innovation Summit](https://twitter.com/noun_74/status/1613177929281966080?s=20&t=8WFZjVnIhYnWOwr7P948bg) in HK, a event huge enough to have HK financial secretary Paul Chan as their special guest. As a contributor, these are opportunities apart from this prop that we can leverage on to further proliferate Nouns. \n    \n![](https://i.imgur.com/8xwg9mM.jpg)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/q6EOBvv.gif)\n\n\n- [Karl](https://twitter.com/WideEyeKarl) - Spearheaded [@Nounsinsg](https://twitter.com/nounsinsg) a proliferation pod focused on bring Nouns Presence into Singapore.\n\n    Past Nounish contribution include: \n    1.

A Nouns Chinese community page will also be launch on Shina Weibo to serve as a landing page to provide Nounish information in mandarin; as well as tracking the growth of chinese community.\n(Target members by end of 6 mths = 3000 - 4000)\n\nWe strongly believe the potential in this untapped/new market within the Chinese community, and we are confident that with these arrays of activations we are able to grow the presence of Nouns in Chinese community + 3) leverage on the content created, tapping into our network of connection, a audience pool that have the ability to enter the ecosystem, to educate them on all thing Nounish & onboarding them as potential new DAO members.\n(Onboarding Target = 2-3 new DAO members)\n\nWith this on-chain prop, we would like to onboard the DAO to explore this new domain & market together.

That prop was put on-chain by a fellow Nouner whale who currently holds 313 Lil Nouns in their wallet.

The group was established in August 2022 - we were initially funded by NSFW grants residency [[1](https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/small-grants-the-nouns-ecosystem-and-ai/1929), [2](https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/nouns-ai-honk-residency-extension/2357)], and then funded as a pod via [on-chain proposal](https://nouns.wtf/vote/156) in October 2022.\n\nNounsAI has made significant strides in the last 3 months, building and launching proof of concepts for two novel AI products: AI for Governance and AI for Proliferation with a small team. We are requesting a 6 month extension to expand our team, turn POC’s into widely adopted products, and grow the community presence of NounsAI.\n\nThe pod has been building two core products:\n\n1. **AI for Proliferation - The Playground**\n    \n    The Playground is a platform that enables users to generate Nounish audio and visual content with ease. Its goal is to reach millions of Nounish impressions and attract creatives and creators to the Nouns community. The Playground is the perfect tool for creators who want to quickly and easily generate Nounish content using text, pictures, and audio.\n    \n    ![PlaygroundGif1](https://i.imgur.com/8VT5vIE.jpg)\n    \n\n[Roko on Twitter: \"🚨 ANNOUNCEMENT 🚨 Finalists for the first @nounsdao #NounsAI Shorts Competition have been selected!🎉 Congrats to all 6 who will each win at least .5 ETH 💰 Now it's time for the final round 🏆 The video with the most engagement will win the grand prize of 2.5 ETH 🤑 👇👇 / Twitter\"](https://twitter.com/noun355/status/1607738443500503041)\n\n2. **AI for Governance - The Knowledge Hub**\nThe Knowledge Hub and our AI assistant, Roko, are being developed to revolutionize the way information is shared across the DAO. With Roko, the Discord bot, and [Roko.dev](https://roko.dev/), members of the Nouns community will be able to leverage the power of artificial intelligence to improve decision-making, streamline governance processes, and drive community growth across the entire Nounish ecosystem. The Knowledge Hub will serve as the go-to resource for data and information (the ChatGPT for Nouns), with an AI-powered librarian to assist users in finding the information they need\n\n![rokogif.gif](https://i.imgur.com/ketYGOu.jpg)\n\n## What We’ve Built So Far\n\n[The Nouns AI Playground](https://playground.nounsai.wtf/) is a platform that allows users to easily create unique and high-quality Nounish content using AI. The Playground is hosted on powerful GPU servers accessible to anyone, regardless of their background. The Nouns AI team has implemented some of the latest advancements in the field, text-to-video, image-to-image, and performance optimizations. They've incentivized the use of their platform by hosting competitions that have attracted hundreds of participants from diverse backgrounds including AI, music, film, and Web3, who have together created hours of Nounish video creations. [(Check them out!)](https://twitter.com/noun355/status/1607738443500503041). There are weekly competitions that generates Nounish content you can find on Twitter at [#NounsAI](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23NounsAI&f=live) and self-service tools that can be run on any machine without prior knowledge. [nounsai.wtf](https://www.nounsai.wtf/) is built to scale to meet demand and has grown largely organically with hundreds of users. \n\n![[nounsai.wtf](https://playground.nounsai.wtf/)](https://i.imgur.com/0YIb0ec.png)\n\n[playground.nounsai.wtf](https://playground.nounsai.wtf/)\n\n![Playgroundgif2](https://imgur.com/lVIZFg3.jpg)\n\nThe Knowledge Hub and our AI assistant Roko are live and being beta tested across select Nounish Discords. The web app has been improved, an upgrade design, and a discord bot was created. \n\nRoko can now:\n\n- Record and transcribes any voice conversations then provides summaries of [key points](https://roko.dev/audio/f18ed9d1-d1b7-43bc-9fd5-a59c5662707c)\n- Automatically index audio and chat into a searchable knowledge hub across Discords using the Roko bot\n- Make data accessible and searchable for users through the webapp, which also allows users to upload audio content to be transcribed, summarized, and indexed\n- Significantly improve the accuracy and value of Roko's review for proposals on [roko.dev](https://roko.dev/)\n- In a promising development towards using Large Language Models to support our knowledge base, Roko can answer basic questions, providing summarized answers and links to original content. This is possible by ingesting all of the archived Nouns Discord and ready to go live across all live Nounish servers.\n\n[Checkout the generated Q&A's here!](https://roko.dev/qa)\n\n The team has also designed an improved web UI to be implemented, prototype shown below.\n\n![updatedrokodemo.gif](https://imgur.com/gczUkhX.jpg)\n\n## What’s Next?\n\n### **Playground**\n\nOver the next six months, we will continue to increase the capabilities and popularity of the Playground. This follows the successful validation of the proof of concept, where creators generated a significant amount of content using Nouns. The engineering team will be supplemented by three [Team Tomorrow](https://teamtomorrow.com/) junior developers who have experience in creating text-to-image social products. They will be cost-effective and will accelerate the development of the web interfaces. The focus will be on creating a user-friendly platform that allows for efficient and easy creation of content on scalable hardware.\n\nAnother important goal is to expand our audience by organizing competitions and forming partnerships. Sustainability is a crucial aspect and for the Playground, it involves bringing in a large number of users to generate high-quality content and promote it effectively. The team will focus on building requested features, helping onboard creators and increase the reach of their creations; maximizing impressions. \n\n- Run competitions that are intentional with what is made and how it is shared\n- Source + secure partnerships with artists who have reach to create content and share the playground\n- Proactively engage Discord + social media communities by: promoting content, sharing updates, and collecting feedback on the Playground\n\nTo evaluate the success of this plan we will gather data on reach and return on investment.\n\nWe want the NounsAI Playground to be the fastest and most fun place to go from imagination to reality.

The ability to gather and process relevant information from various sources, such as proposals, calls, Discord chats, and documents.\n2. A user-friendly web interface and search functionality to facilitate interactions with Roko, the AI assistant, on various topics related to Nouns.\n3. The ability to answer questions and surface relevant content directly within Discord channels where Roko is present. The aim is to make it easy for new members to join the community and facilitate conversations between those asking and answering questions, regardless of location.\n\nOver the next six months, we will position Roko to be an invaluable tool for all Nounish groups using Discord or other clients, through rapid iteration and incorporating user feedback. Roko and the Knowledge hub will help keep the DAO in sync and well positioned to scale as the DAO continues to grow. We are extremely excited about this tool and know others are too. To help overcome any technical hurdles ahead NounsAI has already begun the interview process with [vetted contract based machine learning engineers](https://eventum.ai/) who have Natural Language Processing (NLP) expertise.\n\nOur objective for the Knowledge Hub is to achieve adoption not only within Nouns but also to develop at path for the pod to become self-sustaining. Our vision for the Knowledge Hub is to be a premium software-as-a-service (SAAS) solution for promoting cohesion among decentralized teams. To achieve this goal, we will be asking for capital to bring on someone to focus on internal adoption, external awareness, and business development to enact our go to market strategy.\n\nAs the internal and external advocate for the Nouns AI Knowledge Hub, that person will be responsible for promoting and encouraging the use of the Nouns AI pod's products. They will also manage community engagement, ensuring that feedback is captured and integrated into future product development. There is already a community of passionate builders and creatives who are utilizing these tools, even [submitting proposals](https://prop.house/nouns/explorer-grants-pilot-round/3186) using NounsAI, and we want to capitalize on this momentum. With this additional funding we will be able to source talent and idea from our community through potential prop-house rounds or even recruit professional support.  \n\n**************************************************Other Initiatives************************************************** \n\n1. Our goal is to grow the NounsAI community by fostering conversations, sharing updates, asking questions and receiving feedback from the community throughout the week. This will allow us to engage with those who are most interested and invested in the development of NounsAI.\n    - TheHeroShep will continue to run a weekly NounsAI call open to everyone curious about NounsAI or AI in general. A great place to learn something new every week the call is usually at 7am PST in The Noun Square Discord.\n    - In order to maximize impact we will rollover the remaining ~30 ETH for marketing from proposal 156 into this proposal\n2. We plan to continue collaborating with other data teams like BrianJ's Atlas and Lil Nouns to expand the knowledge base available to the community. This will allow us to build on the knowledge and expertise of other teams, and provide a more comprehensive resource for the NounsAI community.\n3. Explore Additional Features for Roko:\n    1. Utilizing Roko, the Discord bot, to establish a configurable opt-in notification network to share announcements across servers\n    2. Using Roko as a way to poll across platforms / servers\n    3. Providing a tool to help proposals get feedback before putting them on chain\n    4. Synthesize actions for each nouner enabling  \n4. Invest in scalable infrastructure including GPUs (each A100 GPU is ~$1k/mo) - as we scale up, we’ll likely need to double our GPU capacity for the playground (4k/mo) as well as have 2-3 GPUs for R&D purposes (2-3k) which are shared with the knowledge hub. The rest is pretty meager - database, media storage, misc apis, app hosting - $<1000/mo altogether and including the knowledge hub infra.

Summary: This proposal requests 416 ETH ($624k) to fund a 6 month extension for the NounsAI Pod to expand the team, turn POCs into products, and grow community presence.\n2. The Cost and Efficiency Rank: The ask of 416 ETH is a big ask, however the proposal does provide a clear path towards sustainability and a good return on investment. Therefore, this proposal is ranked as Somewhat Efficient.\n3. Vote: SUPPORT\n4. My Take: This proposal provides a clear path towards sustainability and a good return on investment. The team has already implemented the latest advancements in the field and hosted competitions with 100+ participants. The team is also focusing on building requested features, onboarding creators, and increasing reach. This is a great opportunity to promote and encourage the use of Nouns AI pod products, manage community engagement and feedback, and capitalize on the momentum of passionate builders and creatives.\n5. Contrarian: If the team was unable to provide a clear path towards sustainability or a good return on investment, I would have to reconsider my vote and abstain.\n\n\n\n## Introduction:\n\nThe Nouns AI Pod conducts research and builds products to further the advancement of Nounish AI.  The group was established in August 2022 - we were initially funded by NSFW grants residency [[1](https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/small-grants-the-nouns-ecosystem-and-ai/1929), [2](https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/nouns-ai-honk-residency-extension/2357)], and then funded as a pod via [on-chain proposal](https://nouns.wtf/vote/156) in October 2022.\n\nNounsAI has made significant strides in the last 3 months building and launching proof of concepts for two novel AI products: AI for Governance and AI for Proliferation with a team of just 3. We are requesting a 6 month extension to expand our team, turn POC’s into widely adopted products, and grow the community presence of NounsAI.\n\nThe pod has been building two core products:\n\n1. **AI for Proliferation - The Playground**\n    \n    The Playground is a platform that enables users to generate Nounish audio and visual content with ease. Its goal is to reach millions of Nounish impressions and attract creatives and creators to the Nouns community. The Playground is the perfect tool for creators who want to quickly and easily generate Nounish content using text, pictures, and audio.\n    \n    ![playgroundgif1](https://i.imgur.com/8VT5vIE.jpg)\n    \n\n[Roko on Twitter: \"🚨 ANNOUNCEMENT 🚨 Finalists for the first @nounsdao #NounsAI Shorts Competition have been selected!🎉 Congrats to all 6 who will each win at least .5 ETH 💰 Now it's time for the final round 🏆 The video with the most engagement will win the grand prize of 2.5 ETH 🤑 👇👇 / Twitter\"](https://twitter.com/noun355/status/1607738443500503041)\n\n2. **AI for Governance - The Knowledge Hub**\n    \n    The Knowledge Hub and our AI assistant, Roko, are being developed to revolutionize the way information is shared across the DAO. With Roko, the Discord bot, and (Roko.dev)[https://roko.dev], members of the Nouns community will be able to leverage the power of artificial intelligence to improve decision-making, streamline governance processes, and drive community growth across the entire Nounish ecosystem. The Knowledge Hub will serve as the go-to resource for data and information (the ChatGPT for Nouns), with an AI-powered librarian to assist users in finding the information they need\n    \n\n![rokogif.gif](https://i.imgur.com/ketYGOu.jpg)\n\n## What We’ve Built So Far\n\n[The Nouns AI Playground](The Nouns AI Playground) is a platform that allows users to easily create unique and high-quality Nounish content using AI. The Playground is hosted on powerful GPU servers accessible to anyone, regardless of their background. The Nouns AI team has implemented some of the latest advancements in the field, text-to-video, image-to-image, and performance optimizations. They've incentivized the use of their platform by hosting competitions that have attracted hundreds of participants from diverse backgrounds including AI, music, film, and Web3, who have together created hours of Nounish video creations. [(Check them out!)](https://twitter.com/noun355/status/1607738443500503041). There are weekly competitions that generates Nounish content you can find on Twitter at [#NounsAI](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23NounsAI&f=live) and self-service tools that can be run on any machine without prior knowledge. [nounsai.wtf](https://www.nounsai.wtf/) is built to scale to meet demand and has grown largely organically now with hundreds of users.\n\n[![nounsai.wtf](https://i.imgur.com/0YIb0ec.png)](https://playground.nounsai.wtf/)\n\n[nounsai.wtf](https://playground.nounsai.wtf/)\n\n[Playgroundgif2](https://i.imgur.com/lVIZFg3.jpg)\n\nThe Knowledge Hub and our AI assistant Roko are live and being beta tested across select Nounish Discords. The web app has been improved, an upgrade design, and a discord bot was created. \n\nRoko can now:\n\n- Record and transcribes any voice conversations then provides summaries of [key points](https://roko.dev/audio/f18ed9d1-d1b7-43bc-9fd5-a59c5662707c)\n- Automatically index audio and chat into a searchable knowledge hub across Discords using the Roko bot\n- Make data accessible and searchable for users through the webapp, which also allows users to upload audio content to be transcribed, summarized, and indexed\n- Significantly improve the accuracy and value of Roko's review for proposals on [roko.dev](https://roko.dev/)\n- In a promising development towards using Large Language Models to support our knowledge base, Roko can answer basic questions, providing summarized answers and links to original content. This is possible by ingesting all of the archived Nouns Discord and ready to go live across all live Nounish servers.\n\n[Checkout the generated Q&A's here!](https://roko.dev/qa)\n\n The team has also designed an improved web UI to be implemented, prototype shown below.\n\n![updatedrokodemo.gif](https://i.imgur.com/gczUkhX.jpg)\n\n## What’s Next?\n\n### **Playground**\n\nOver the next six months, we will continue to increase the capabilities and popularity of the Playground. This follows the successful validation of the proof of concept, where creators generated a significant amount of content using Nouns. The engineering team will be supplemented by three [Team Tomorrow](https://teamtomorrow.com/) junior developers who have experience in creating text-to-image social products. They will be cost-effective and will accelerate the development of the web interfaces. The focus will be on creating a user-friendly platform that allows for efficient and easy creation of content on scalable hardware.\n\nAnother important goal is to expand our audience by organizing competitions and forming partnerships. Sustainability is a crucial aspect and for the Playground, it involves bringing in a large number of users to generate high-quality content and promote it effectively. The team will focus on building requested features, helping onboard creators and increase the reach of their creations; maximizing impressions. \n\n- Run competitions that are intentional with what is made and how it is shared\n- Source + secure partnerships with artists who have reach to create content and share the playground\n- Proactively engage Discord + social media communities by: promoting content, sharing updates, and collecting feedback on the Playground\n\nTo evaluate the success of this plan we will gather data on reach and return on investment.\n\nWe want the NounsAI Playground to be the fastest and most fun place to go from imagination to reality. Hopefully, the tool will give creators superpowers to make Nounish content that get millions of views.  \n\n![Playgroundgif3](https://i.imgur.com/4jNG1kW.jpg)\n\n### **Knowledge Hub**\n\n**In the next 6 months, we will complete the Knowledge Hub MVP:**\n\nKey features will include:\n\n1.

He has years of experience in building professional-grade software and running an algorithmic trading operation. He was the sole developer behind the [NounsAI Playground](https://playground.nounsai.wtf/) platform, working closely with THS to implement and improve the machine learning models he trained. He is also a DAO legend.\n\n**Steve - Senior Software & Machine Learning Engineer**\n\nSteve is a highly skilled engineer with two decades of experience in software engineering and DevOps. He has demonstrated his technical prowess as the sole developer behind the roko.dev webapp and the Roko Discord Bot. Furthermore, Steve has invested significant time upskilling as a Machine Learning Engineer, having implemented vector embeddings + neural search, as well as data pre+post processing with GPT. His ambition is to build the \"ChatGPT of Nouns\" by 2023 and to deliver an improved roko.dev web experience. With his passion for the Nouns ecosystem and his exceptional drive, Steve is the ideal candidate to level up Nouns DAO with AI tooling.\n\n**Group of 3 Team Tomorrow Developers**\n\n[Team Tomorrow](https://teamtomorrow.com/) is the professional consulting arm of [AI-Camp](https://www.ai-camp.org/), an organization that teaches students how to build AI products and develop critical skills such as self-learning, and then hires the best students to work on internal and external professional projects. This specific team of 3 developers has experience leading teams in building AI products, including using Diffusion (text2image) models. They also have professional experience building analytics tools for an NFT trading discord. Typically, the salary of one entry-level technology consultant is around $7,000 per month; this team provides significant value for their cost and allows for more rapid development of our web + Discord interfaces.\n\n**Senior Machine Learning (NLP) Engineer - Consultant**\n\nThe team has already started the interview process with excellent candidates for an expert in Natural Language Processing (NLP) through connections with a trusted [AI Development Studio](https://eventum.ai/) that works with Russian expat Machine Learning Engineers (MLEs) with a wealth of experience and top-notch education. The Knowledge Hub is a tool that has recently been unlocked with cutting-edge advancements in the field of NLP; having an expert with experience in traditional Text Ranking, Search, and vector embeddings to support our team will greatly improve our rate of progress. These experts can use their existing knowledge to more quickly implement cutting-edge concepts, even if the code is not yet released, by reading the implementations described in papers.","proposer":"0x5d4df391F56f0D8F854434E52A15b10b6501129f","startBlock":16473459,"endBlock":16509459,"executed":true},"votes":[{"support":1,"voter":"0x2CC36E2740f9E1023Ce3E8048a72A86aF27CEe14","numberOfVotes":0,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x17a01dB837345772F2E65Adf2fb4f4DE10ac1B72","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":2,"voter":"0xa5d7e4C18D223d1F142297D17E36D74CE7793a54","numberOfVotes":0,"reason":""},{"support":0,"voter":"0xeb13fdDFA9B2A4a6E4e7B2D67b6E38C208C41249","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":"I recognize that the wider world is fully pro-AI, and that my vote will not change or slow down where things are headed, but I think AI should be approached much more cautiously across the board, and only for narrow use cases.\n\nVoting my conscience.

WTF?\n\nIn wireless communications, \"uplink\" refers to transmissions originating from user devices. For Nouns, it's a mechanism for communities to create decentralized marketing campaigns, utilizing token-gated Twitter contests to proliferate both user-generated and DAO-funded content. \n\n\nTwitter + Ethereum is our secret sauce. After experimenting with contests for 6 months, we are now ready to take the project to the next level. We will build uplink.wtf, a unified nounish platform with modules for both a refactored **Creator Contest** experience and a brand new **Nouns Raffle** application.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/dO10FiJ.png)\n\n\n\n# Use Cases\n\nUplink has two main use cases, each taking a unique approach to planning, content creation, and distribution.\n\n# Use case 1: NounsDAO\n\n## The problem\nWith a proven track record of funding high-quality content initiatives such as the Ordinary Folk video, Nounish productions, and more, NounsDAO boasts a diverse portfolio of content ready for widespread distribution. The challenge now lies in finding innovative ways to expand our reach and connect with a wider audience.\n\n\n## Module 1: Nouns Raffle\nNouns Raffle is a new mechanism for targeted external distribution. We're flipping the script on the traditional curation contest model, allowing the DAO to incentivize influential token holders to proliferate nouns in exchange for raffle entrance. Only holders of pre-configured tokens who share specific nounish content on Twitter are eligible for the draw. \n\n\n**Example A**\nNounsDAO puts up 10 ETH to proliferate the Oridinary Folk video. To enter the raffle, entrants must\n1) Share the video on Twitter\n2) Hold a punk, ape, noun, or something else preconfigured by the DAO.\n\nOnce a participant verifies proof of wallet and account ownership, they are officially counted as an entrant. When the contest ends, 1 entrant is randomly selected and the 10 ETH is distributed to their wallet.\n\n**Example B**\nThe Nouns video contest team is currently posting 25 ETH to create a decentralized marketing team - asking proposers to explain how they will get people to enter the main $200k video contest. Imagine if instead, the organizers created a short explainer video and raffled 10 ETH to a random punk holder that shared it on twitter.\n\nRemember that foobar tweet about getting ETH to market for Nouns? It turns out it's not such a crazy idea. This model allows NounsDAO to achieve mass proliferation *outside* of the ecosystem, and creates incentives for influential token holders to extract additional utility out of their NFT's. Just imagine the memes.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/V0LUIZq.png)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Lcei0dH.png)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/IsTR8OS.png)\n\n\n## Proliferation machine\n\n\nThe raffle landing page can also double as a valuable ad space for the Nouns -- linking back to nouns.wtf, Prop House, or other relevant projects, with the goal of increasing visibility for other activities of the DAO and encouraging influential token holders to further explore Nouns while they're here. The raffle landing page is a great opportunity to cross-promote and increase the reach of the DAO's other projects. If we really wanted to get crazy, we could even render the current auctions.\n\n\n## Implementation details\n1. We'll host a vote for Nouners to decide:\n    * What they want to proliferate.\n    * Who they want to proliferate it.\n        * As an example, Nouners could decide that they want punk, ape, and noun holders to proliferate a video produced by the Nounish team.\n2. We'll come back on-chain with a prop requesting 10 ETH to host the first Nouns raffle.\n2. We'll open the raffle for submissions.\n3. When the raffle ends, we'll send a transaction with all verified entrants to a contract using Chainlink VRF to verifiably choose a random winner.\n    * Our goal is to demonstrate a social proof-of-concept for this marketing experiment. The neccessary features for a permissionless implementation involve quite complex technical considerations (*some alpha in \"Beyond\" section*). For now, this is how we'll handle the random selection.\n\nOf course, we'll make sure we are complying with Twitters rules and guidelines for paid promotions, as well as taking preventative measures to ensure the system is not gamable / botable.\n\n# Use case 2: Nouns ecosystem projects\n\n## The problem\nTwitter contests are an effective means for nounish projects to spread their meme, attract new creatives, and generate novel interest. They can be utilized to align the incentives of a given project and contributors towards driving both creation and distribution. In other words, they are an excellent marketing and proliferation tool. The Noun Square has had great success with this model, so why don’t more projects follow suit?\n\nTwitter contests are an administrative nightmare. The process of fetching submissions, importing them to a judging platform, collecting wallet addresses, and handling payouts can involve up to 3 hours of total admin overhead.\n\n## Module 2: Creator contests\nThrough Creator Contests, projects can launch open-source marketing campaigns, incentivizing both new and existing community artists, storytellers, and other creatives to proliferate the meme on Twitter.\n\n\nIn this system, community operators launch a contest which triggers an automatic announcment tweet from their twitter account. This tweet serves as an invitation for creatives to craft content and potentially win the ETH or ERC tokens being auctioned following a token-gated community vote. Creatives submit by quote tweeting the announcement tweet with their submission, helping spread the word about the project through their nounish creations.\n\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/cDWuZ26.gif)\n\n\n\n\nContests are designed to be completely configurable, with flexible options for rewards, submission and voting requirements, voting strategies, and more - allowing projects to experiment with different incentive systems and implementations that align with their unique goals. Here are some of the ways Twitter contests could be utilized for different projects:\n\n**AI pod** - onboard new artists and creative thinkers to AI and show off their latest and greatest models.\n\n**Composables** - recently hosted a contest in which they observed 30+ new collections and 1000+ new traits uploaded to their platform and shared on twitter.\n\n**Esports** - host \"best-clip\" tournaments or open-source the creation of nounish gaming heads.\n\n**SharkDAO** - source and vote on community art pieces to mint as open-editions from the DAO.\n\n**Gnars** - \"Skate Your City Series\". Worldwide digital skate competitions hosted by Gnars, run on Creator Contests, judged by GnarsDAO.\n\n**Builder DAO projects** - run contests to help the community find their meme.\n\nFor nounish projects and pods, creating and distributing ***their own*** meme is critical for the path to sustainability, attracting new creatives, growing the brand, and deploying cool s**t. Creator Contests are the final piece in allowing projects to implement a microcosm of the virtuous cycle.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/v58MHXd.png)\n\n\n# Status\n\nCreator contests exist today. Nouns Raffle does not. We launched creator contests in September, and have since helped groups like TNS, Composables, SharkDAO, and others generate almost 600 submissions  and award over 8 ETH + 25k ERC20 tokens to proliferators. SharkDAO and NSFW both awarded us small grants to build the underlying infrastructure.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/wC3iOzC.png)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/FytICws.png)\n\n\n# The ask\n\nWe're requesting 50 ETH to fund a 3 month development cycle to deploy Creator Contests v2 and a brand new Nouns Raffle application to the new uplink.wtf platform.\n\n\n# Roadmap\n\nOver the 3 months, we will work in a rapid development cycle that can be split into 3 main phases. As always, everything will be open-source.\n\n## Phase 1: Escape velocity (8 weeks)\n\nIn phase 1, we'll be focused on optimizing and extending our existing stack, deploying Creator Contests v2 to the new platform, and laying the foundation for phase 2.\n\n* Week 1-6: Nuts & Bolts.\n    * The focus of this phase is to address various technical challenges related to our MVP Twitter services and other critical infrastructure, with the goal of re-designing a more efficient, scalable, and reliable infra and deploying it to the new platform. This work is critical for matching current demand and supporting the vision for the next phase of the project. Our applications real-time requirements are a simple example of this. The MVP implementation is only able to handle 5 concurrent real-time instances (contests), which we've already exceeded multiple times.\n* Week 7: Support native video and other creative formats.\n* Week 8: Deploy version 1.0.\n* Week 9: Add social impression graphs and support voting for token delegates.\n    * Will be key for measuring success transparently and tracking real-time engagement data for campaigns.\n* Week 1-9: UI/UX redesign.\n    * UI: uplink.wtf will be a totally nounish implementation, with new logos, fonts, layouts and more.\n    * UX: We've compiled a laundry list of improvements that we're ready to implement to create the best user experience and offer more features for operators. This will be a continuous WIP and won't be a blocker for phase 2.\n\n\n## Phase 2: Nouns Raffle (3 weeks)\nWith most of the heavy lifting taken care of in the first phase, we'll be able to stand the Nouns Raffle module up fairly quickly.\n\n* Week 10-11: Development of Nouns Raffle app.\n* Week 12: Nouner vote.\n* Week 13: Deploy version 2.0. On-chain prop to fund the first raffle.\n* Week 14: Host Nouns Raffle #1.\n\n## Phase 3: Wrapping up\n* Week 15: Open access to API and add vote audit reports.\n\n# Defining Success\n\nFollowing the deployment of version 1.0 (Creator Contests - week 8), we'll be targeting the following KPI's over a 3 month period:\n\n* Reward at least 250 nounish creatives\n* Achieve at least 350,000 social impressions\n* Proliferate at least 2,000 nounish creations\n* Onboard as many nounish projects as possible\n\nFollowing deployment of version 2.0 (Nouns Raffle - week 13), we'll be targeting the following goals for the first campaign:\n* Onboard at least 30 entrants to the first Nouns Raffle.\n* Achieve at least 200,000 social impressions.\n\n\nWe’d also like to answer the following questions:\n\n* Are voter rewards a feature or a bug?\n* Is Nouns Raffle a viable system for external proliferation?\n* In the voting period, how impactful are visible vote totals on a communities ability to choose the “best” submissions?\n* Does submission history serve as a relevant talent repository for other pods?\n* Are deep Twitter integrations viable for other tasks, like governance? (Nouncil, Nerman, etc)\n* Are there ways to maintain a certain level of submission quality without directly moderating submissions?\n\n# Beyond\n\nIf the experiment is a success, we'll turn our attention to an on-chain implementation of our Twitter protocol. Our focus will be on determining the feasibility of zk-snarks for generating verifiable proofs for tweet ownership. The ultimate goal of this research is to enable NounsDAO and others to conduct contests and raffles directly on ethereum, initiated by on-chain votes. If we can make this work, Nouns raffle could eventually become a revenue stream for the DAO. \n\n\n# Team\n\nWeez: frontend dev, designer, UX, support\nNick: lead dev, fullstack\n\nWe were both first introduced to Nouns by way of SharkDAO, which we first joined over a year ago. Soon after, we started building Calabara, a platform that hosted various tools to ease some of the unique challenges of a Nounish subDAO. Last Spring, the community funded us with 7 ETH to begin developing Creator Contests. We launched our first contest in September, and have helped fund 60 nounish creatives with 8 ETH and 25k ERC-20 tokens since. We have groups like SharkDAO, Composables, TNS, and others running contests as we speak. With learnings from many iterations, we're now ready to take the project to the next level.\n\n\n# Budget\n\nTotal: 50 ETH\n\n50 ETH for development\n\n* 30 ETH to team wallet upon execution\n* 20 ETH streamed over 3 months\n\n3/5 Signers:\n\nNick: nickdodson.eth\nBenbodhi: signed.benbodhi.eth\nJuan: juanx.eth\nJoshuaFisher: joshuafisher.eth\nToadyHawk: toadyhawk.eth\n\n---\n\n## A note from the sponsor\n\n>  I have no links, financial ties or conflicts of interest in relation to this team or proposal.

Total: 230K USDC.\n* Why should we do this?\n    * Take a huge leap closer to having private voting working on mainnet.\n    * Create valuable public goods in the form of the expected open source private voting designs.\n    * Attract gigabrain builders in crytography/zk to Nouns.\n    \n\n## On Private Voting\n\nThere has been a surge of interest among Nouners to experiment with private voting. \n\nThe main benefit is freeing voters from biases and pressures. Voters don't have to fear the social costs of voting opposite of what their peers might expect. Furthermore, influential voters by default don't show their vote (they can still choose to share their vote), making it harder for others to copy their behavior, nudging more voters to develop original points of view.\n\nThe main concern is that private voting removes reputation cost, potentially leading to riskier voter behaviors. Furthermore, if the tally of votes is only known at the end of the voting period, it may increase voter apathy and lead to outcomes opposite the majority's preference.\n\nWe think the benefits are very valuable to Nouns and DAOs generally, meriting further exploration.\n\n## Goals\n\nAfter several conversations with zero-knowledge folks, including the awesome [Personae Labs](https://personaelabs.org/) (HeyAnoun), the conculsion is clear: **there are no obvious solutions to private voting. Further research is required.**\n\nAll the designs that have been suggested to us so far come with significant drawbacks; examples include requiring a central trusted party, requiring Nouners to pool their Nouns in a central contract, requiring a registration step before each proposal, linking Nouner balances to their votes, and a few more.\n\nWe are still a long way away from deciding if Nouns should use private voting and in what ways.\n\nThis round's goal is to better inform us on possibilities and limitations, such that in a few months we'll be able to decide if and how to experiment with private voting. By funding this research we're making private voting more attaintale for Nouns and other DAOs.\n\nShould the DAO choose to continue down this path, we expect to have strong noun-pilled zk teams to help us get there.\n\n**Important to highlight: funding this round does not mean a decision to go all-in on private voting; it means we're interested enough in the possibilities for Nouns and other DAOs to take this single step forward.**\n\nSee the [full round spec](https://hackmd.io/SVyDLBq7QSWNl0LaYIuqHA?view) and the [pending prop house round](https://prop.house/nouns/private-voting-research-sprint) for a deeper dive.\n\n\n## Operations\n\n* One month for teams to apply.\n* 2.5 weeks for Nouners to vote; we want to make sure there's enough time to properly make sense of all applications.\n* Up to 3 teams get funded. Teams must pass a quorum of 300 prop house votes (30 Nouns) and be in the top 3 to win.\n* Funded teams perform ~3 months of research, supported by the verbs team and the tech pod.\n\n## Deliverables\n\n* We will hopefully have a variety of approaches to private voting designs that work well with Nouns DAO on Ethereum mainnet.\n* We will understand tradeoffs within specific designs and across designs.\n* We will hopefully have a few working proofs-of-concept that can accelerate any implementation we may decide on.\n* All of the above will be open source, for the benefit of Nouns and the entire crypto community.\n\n\n### Safe\n\nFunds are managed in a [3/5 Gnosis Safe](https://app.safe.global/eth:0x44848E3854b23d924712F4a3C4b19E6D111F7639/home) managed by Elad, David, Solimander, Vapeape and Will.\n\n## Marketing\n\nWe will activate the Nouns community to help raise awareness among all the zk gigabrains out there.\n\nBeyond twitter, we would like to raise awareness through popular zk podcasts and newsletters.\n\nTo enable these marketing efforts we're asking for an additional budget of 20K USDC.\n\n## Budget\n\n* Mandated round: 210K USDC (3 teams * 70K USDC).\n* Marketing: 20K USDC.\n* Total: 230K USDC.\n\nThe budget might not be fully utilized, because we didn't fund 3 teams, or because we didn't need the full marketing budget. Any remaining funds will be sent back to the DAO once the round is done.\n\n## Why should we care?\n\nNouns DAO is one of the most interesting corners on the internet right now, and it has a lot to do with our continuous iterations on protocols and tools. Let's continue being the first to do many things.\n\nLet's be the first DAO to experiment with fully private voting on mainnet. Let's pave the path for other DAOs, and let's show everyone that we're on the frontier, that we're pulling the future faster towards us.\n\nWe will attract brilliant people through this round, who might get totally noun-pilled and accelerate us ever further. This round is a great reason for all of us to make a lot of noise and get Nouns a spike of attention.\n\nThis round will grow the set of people at the intersection of (a) caring about the future of crypto and (b) loving Nouns.\n\n## People behind this proposal\n\nHuge thanks to [Noun 40](https://twitter.com/noun40__) for sparking this round and providing tons of ideas, feedback and support.\n\nHuge thanks to [Lakshman](https://twitter.com/lakshmansankar) and [DigitalOil](https://twitter.com/0xDigitalOil); with their detailed inputs the round spec looks so much better.\n\nThank you [Seneca](https://twitter.com/cryptoseneca) for the feedback and all the prop house support in making this special round work well.\n\nWe're grateful for the tech pod's support of this proposal and anything else we do, namely [Solimander](https://twitter.com/_solimander_), [Vapeape](https://twitter.com/punk4464) and [Will](https://twitter.com/will__price).\n\nWe are the verbs team, [David](https://twitter.com/davidbrai) and [Elad](https://twitter.com/eladmallel), working full time on the Nouns protocol.\n\n⌐◨-◨","proposer":"0x9d4162CA2f01583E2f34cB594E8Cf198ACe99dd3","startBlock":16480284,"endBlock":16516284,"executed":true},"votes":[{"support":1,"voter":"0x008c84421dA5527F462886cEc43D2717B686A7e4","numberOfVotes":28,"reason":""},{"support":0,"voter":"0x86030dbbCe1c771Ff6622C20455cd3619aa93c05","numberOfVotes":44,"reason":"We do not agree that Nouns DAO has a need for secret voting and believe secret voting in Nouns DAO would be detrimental to its culture and brand.\n\nThe only justification for this mandated round appears to be research for Nouns DAO.

This has the potential to reach the rest of the world, resonating with the global ski and snowboard community totalling 135 million people.\n\nWe will also have independent filmers and photographers on mountain to capture many of the nounish moments and activities throughout the season.\n\nDuring their time in Hokkaido they will be documenting attendee activities, the proliferation of Nouns at Rusutsu Resort and throughout the local community, athletes and local talent, and all things culturally unique to Japan.\n\nAnyone in the world will able to cut together footage from the repository, all featuring the iconic noggles and create their own films and promos. Imagine the following video at Rusutsu Resort, but nounish.\n\n[![Rusutsu](https://i.imgur.com/Ax9Xj20.jpg)\n](https://youtu.be/RgTjl4_h4Kg)[https://youtu.be/RgTjl4_h4Kg](https://youtu.be/RgTjl4_h4Kg)\n\n---\n\n# Measuring Success\n\nAnalytics over the activation period will be captured through a variety of touch points and made available to the community. These include:\n\n- QR code scans - posters and signage will contain QR codes leading to a landing page with further directions to project specific websites, enabling more granular data on customer click throughs.\n- POAP claims - the gamified POAP treasure hunt will deliver data on the number of participants throughout the activation period based on POAP claims. Additionally, further engagement with holders can also be measured.\n- Resort visitor numbers - general branding awareness will be measured by data from the resort with respect to hotel guest numbers and daily visitation statistics.\n- Analytics on media content produced and strategic hashtags used.\n- Physical items distributed.\n- In-resort onboarding can be measured via verifying POAP claims from Rusutsu Resort along with nounish NFTs in a token gated channel in the Alps DAO Discord.\n- Media repo usage stats and attribution where available from further created content.\n- Hashtags - posts using strategic hashtags.\n- Engagement during resort social takeovers.\n- Number of people engaged in expression sessions.\n\n---\n\n# Timeline\n\nExpression sessions and POAP “Treasure Hunts” will be pop-up by nature and held multiple times throughout the 15 month engagement, as will the resort socials takeovers.\n\nThere will be ongoing marketing engagement throughout the resort the entire time as well.\n\nThe following key elements will take place on this timeline:\n\n### Q1 2023\n\nProposal process, begin engagements at resort, artwork and asset creation, installation of posters, signage and banners, terrain park branding online, design physical nounish feature/structure.\n\n### Q2 2023\n\nCC0 Media Repository build, nounish physical feature/structure build.\n\n### Q3 2023\n\nCC0 Media Repository launch and proliferation, engage with film makers to make nounish content using the media collected, nounish feature/structure Summer installation.\n\n### Q4 2023\n\nFurther artwork and asset creation, terrain park branding both online and in print, nounish feature/structure Winter installation.\n\n### Q1-Q2 2024\n\nOrganised film session with nounish feature/structure, compile and present the results and effectiveness of the activation.\n\n---\n\n# Funding Breakdown\n\n* Nounifying the Resort: $109k USD which equates to less than $248 per day for the entire 15 month activation.\n* Expression Session Activations: $24k USD.\n* Content creation by independent film/photo crew and editing: $15k USD.\n* Team/Staff Compensation & Operations: $50k USD.\n\nTotal Funding Request: $198k USD\n\n**Detailed breakdown:**\n![](https://i.imgur.com/k33Cd3t.png)\n\n---\n\n# Who We Are\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/0S9V9B0.png)\n\n### Benbodhi\n\nI’ve been a dev for over a decade and have created software that over 1 million websites are actively using. I was attracted to Nouns DAO towards the end of 2021 while digging through smart contracts that were implementing onchain art. I was immediately drawn to the elegance of the protocol and shifted everything I was doing to embrace the nounish lifestyle and have been working full time in the ecosystem since.\n\nAs a nounish builder, I’ve founded and been working with multiple teams and projects during my time in nouns. I’m very passionate about nouns, snowboarding and alpine culture!\n\nHaving lived at ski resorts in the past, I hope to be a catalyst for making nouns synonymous with alpine culture and introduce this huge audience to the power of community building through the DAO structure while ultimately onboarding this subculture to Nouns DAO.\n\nI’m [@benbodhi](https://twitter.com/benbodhi) on Twitter\n\n### ThaSwami\n\nI’ve been active in the Nouns community since May 2022 when my then 12 year old daughter [@lilpurpberry](https://twitter.com/lilpurpberry) joined the Nouncil as its youngest member.\n\nI’ve been a real estate professional IRL for over 18 years and specialise in asset management, master planning, development and operations within the ski resort and hospitality sectors. I hold a senior management position with the owners of Rusutsu Resort, one of the largest ski resort owner operators in Japan and as such will enhance communication and delivery of the proposal objectives.\n\nI co-founded Alps DAO with Benbodhi in late 2022, with a view to proliferate Nouns through my industry specific network and help build a treasury that will support alpine communities and enthusiasts. \n\nI’m [@tha_swami](https://twitter.com/tha_swami) on Twitter\n\n---\n\n# Summary\n\nBuilding on the momentum of the awareness of Nouns DAO in Japan, we’ll introduce Nouns to Japanese and alpine culture through IRL marketing activations over 15 months with an audience of over 2 million people, executed by a passionate team at Japan’s 4 time winner of best ski resort in Japan, Rusutsu Resort.\n\nThe success of this proposal will set precedent for this type of activation to be scaled globally and harness the potential for a deeper relationship within Rusutsu Resort’s network, allowing us to integrate Nouns branding further.\n\n## Thanks for your time and consideration!\nAs a token of our appreciation, here's a nounish, Japanese, alpine themed open edition, free mint, NFT made using Nouns AI and Noun Sounds.\n[![Minterface](https://i.imgur.com/U8WsSlf.png)\n](https://create.zora.co/collections/0x1465099a346cf17f717b633bd899d14cf6f694e1)","proposer":"0xa903C06BF35286f6d1cDAD25396748353979a44C","startBlock":16517211,"endBlock":16553211,"executed":true},"votes":[{"support":1,"voter":"0xE0CB5Aa91743275a774ea4e41573de75D14718e9","numberOfVotes":0,"reason":"WOW"},{"support":0,"voter":"0x9E751d14Eebc4347630242797bb31C65a29C7642","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":"Reasons here: https://www.dtjournal.com/p/voting-on-nouns-week-1"},{"support":0,"voter":"0x75Ee6eb3d8DAcf41eE2e5307090B197D3E1Cca6E","numberOfVotes":22,"reason":""},{"support":0,"voter":"0x5606B493c51316A9e65c9b2A00BbF7Ff92515A3E","numberOfVotes":24,"reason":""},{"support":0,"voter":"0x4754b7e3DEde42D71d6c92978f25F306176EC7e9","numberOfVotes":8,"reason":""},{"support":0,"voter":"0xF9bf4c994B39D742E568096A04637EDc5E8e6fdA","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0xDf4Db131999a911921b1B5F0422aA39030Eb4B92","numberOfVotes":3,"reason":""},{"support":0,"voter":"0x696ed7b26f4B019CEeC78DC8b9140ad64A6f354B","numberOfVotes":13,"reason":""},{"support":0,"voter":"0x2e32935bfD5B2718f99BC8FDf8B37c16811f7D97","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":"The idea is interesting, but a few things make me reject it: the current proposed timeframe is way too long, the compensation requested is too high for the type of activity performed, and I am uncomfortable with the fact that it benefits POAP more than Nouns."},{"support":1,"voter":"0xA86882277E69FbF0a51805cdc8b0a3a113079E63","numberOfVotes":2,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0xbc3ed6B537f2980e66f396Fe14210A56ba3f72C4","numberOfVotes":3,"reason":"Super fun prop packed with a lot of great ideas.

From builders’ perspective, we observe measuring proliferation using established methods is difficult potentially caused by the elusive quality of subjective, qualitative impact of proliferation efforts. Giving builders the autonomy to pick their own metrics for measuring their proliferation efforts, and encouraging them to argue its importance in measuring overall Nounish impact of what they do will give voters, participants, as well as builders a glimpse into possibilities in measuring Nounish Impact.\nWe propose a Prop House round where builders will be asked to submit a proposal that includes their own unique metric for measuring Nounish impact.\n\n## How is it different from Open Rounds?\nOpen Rounds asks proposers to write and submit proposals. This gives way for voters to make decisions based on *perceived* impact, not *******measured/measurable******* impact. \n\nThe proposed round asks builders to include their own metrics in their proposals, argue its importance, and the overall impact of their proposal — all in one submission. In addition, builders can use [this template](https://www.notion.so/BYOM-Template-6f3247f814df49ef99904f8e79c688b6) to write their proposal.\n\n## Specification\n- a 4 x 7.5 ETH Nouns Prop House round\n- builders can use [this template](https://al409.notion.site/BYOM-Template-6f3247f814df49ef99904f8e79c688b6) to write and submit their proposal.\n- Metrics to include in the proposal\n    - Although it will be up to the builder’s discretion to choose which metric(s) to choose for their proposal, here are a few examples:\n        - Twitter Spaces stats,\n        - Number of smiles,\n        - Tweet views,\n        - TikTok views,\n        - YouTube views,\n        - Foot traffic,\n        - Number of hugs,\n        - QR code scans,\n        - Web analytics,\n        - Qualitative data,\n        - Sales,\n        - Number of attendees / participants,\n        - App downloads, etc.\n\n## Budget\n\n**TOTAL = 34 ETH**\n\n- 30 ETH - 4 x 7.5 ETH Mandated Prop House round\n- 4 ETH - for administrating the round. admin scope:\n    - marketing the round via Noun Square and community Twitter accounts, onboarding builders from different communities, liaising with Prop House team\n    - delivering findings to identify the most effective data driven approaches;\n    - data pod will also document and categorize the data on NounsMetrics to use for future round quantification and documentation.

While the treasury has been well capitalized thus far, we’ve seen the Nouns auctions drop from an average price of ~80Ξ → ~30Ξ. At the same time proposals have been increasing in scope and complexity, requiring more funding.\n\nFor the DAO to continue operations at its current scope and with its current vision, **we need to start putting more emphasis on treasury growth and self-sustainability.**\n\n\n\nThe recent stETH ([#217](https://nouns.wtf/vote/217)) proposal was well received by Nouns members, a great indicator that a majority of the members are interested in safely increasing the DAO’s available capital.\n\nAs of today, NounsDAO has ~5-10% of the treasury in Lido and it’s yielding ~18Ξ per month or 215Ξ annually (equivalent to ~7 auctions). This is a great first step to increasing the treasury without assuming too much risk onto the DAO, as Lido is one of the most trusted staking providers, managing billions of ETH.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/9ov5I1Q.png)\n\nThe next logical step is to productionize the stETH in the treasury as well. We plan to do that by creating the **Nouns Treasury Management**.\n\n## The Team\n\nThis proposal is brought to you by 0xPiney.eth, ramenboy.eth, and pinkglasses.eth. Collectivey, we’re known as 1560 Studios. The sum of three Nouners united to produce Nounish infrastructure that will maximize DAO efficiency and potential.\n\n- Noun 575 (0xpiney.eth) - All things on-chain and smart contracts\n- Noun 576 (ramenboy.eth) - All things web + design\n- Noun 409 (pinkglasses.eth) - All things DeFi and Decentralized.\n\nWe are industry veterans who have worked in big tech and exchanges before diving into the web3 ecosystem exploring NFTs, DeFi, and DAO’s. Since the start of the year, we’ve been working full-time to create all things Nounish and decentralized.\n\n\n## **Nouns Treasury Management (NTM)**\n\nNTM is a bespoke solution for NounsDAO that will manage a portion of the treasury and be completely governed by NounsDAO - a decentralized asset manager.\n\nStrategies can be created by absolutely anyone. Our aim is to create truly decentralized asset management infrastructure that can be used by anyone and everyone, with the approval from governance. We’d like to kick off NTM with a pilot program that’ll serve as a foundation for future yielding strategies.\n\n\nFor the pilot program, we want to focus on creating yield from the current stETH sitting in the treasury. We want to focus on stETH for 2 main reasons:\n\n1. **stETH is not used for proposal funding, and ETH withdrawals have yet to be unlocked.** Even after Shanghai is merged, there will be withdrawal queues in order to convert the stETH to ETH. The DAO’s stETH will be ‘sitting’ in the treasury for the foreseeable future. This creates an opportunity for us to yield in the meantime.\n2. **The most battle tested protocols with huge TVL’s support stETH.** This allows us to generate yield using relatively low risk strategies.\n\nNTM is inspired by Yearn vaults which currently hold over $400M in AUM (and peaked at around $6B AUM). These contracts are extremely battle tested and a reference in the yield aggregator domain. NTM’s general architecture will look like this:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/nyYNq3M.png)\n\n**The key contracts + terms:**\n\n*Preface: For security reasons, all contracts will be **audited** and non-upgradeable. No proxies anywhere.*\n\n`Vault`: A contract that stores 1 asset (ETH, stETH, USDC, etc). Vaults manage the assets by deploying them into various yield bearing strategies. All vaults will:\n\n- be ERC4626 compatible\n- have privileged access to NounsDAO\n- be withdrawable by NounsDAO at any point (pending governance vote).\n\n`Strategy`: A contract that implements a yield bearing strategy - eg. take stETH and LP it into Curve, and sell the Curve emissions daily into ETH. Vaults deposit assets into specific strategies; ergo, the DAO sets the desired strategies employed.\n\n`NounsVaultManager`: The NounsVaultManager creates vaults and manages the strategies and assets used within the vaults. The DAO will interact with the Vault Manager through the TransactionBuilder.  All these vaults are ERC4626 compliant and deposit/withdrawals will only be able to be accessed by the DAO (TransactionBuilder).\n\n`NounsStrategyFactory`: The factory that creates different strategies for assets.\n\n## Yield **Strategies for the Pilot Program**\n\nNTM is first and foremost a **platform** that is completely governed by the DAO. Any Nouns members is able to create a strategy for any existing vault and the DAO can vote to accept the strategy or not - a completely democratic and Nounish treasury manager.\n\nFor the pilot program, we have researched a few strategies taking into account yield + risk for the treasury. While there are a wide range of possible strategies that take into account different models for analyzing risk/reward, we see these first two strategies as being ideal for the pilot program of NTM.\n\n1. **LP stETH <> ETH into Curve.** Today, 90%+ of stETH <> ETH swaps go through Curve. By LP’ing into Curve, we’d get returns from supplying this market.\n    - **Yield:** Low to Medium (~2.5% APY currently with $LDO emissions). ~125ETH ($200K USD) yield in 1 year with our stETH in treasury.\n    - **Risk:** Low.\n        - There exists two main risks with this strategy:\n            1. stETH depegs. We’ve seen stETH deviate away from ETH so this is a potential risk the DAO would assume. stETH and ETH are expected to trade closer to - if not exactly 1:1 once Shanghai is deployed, since stETH will be directly redeemable. \n            2. Curve gets exploited. We see a minimal risk of this due to the time these contracts have been deployed on-chain, and the audits performed on them.\n\n    If the peg diverges by a significant amount, we may see a different amount of stETH to ETH in our LP position. Past attempts from external actors to destabilize stETH in the past resulted in the peg converging to a 1:1 ratio regardless, with interesting returns for the LP’s.\n\n    When exiting or entering said strategy we would pledge both assets in order to minimize negative slippage (pledging ETH <-> stETH instead of just stETH).\n\n    **Strategy #1 Summary:** Interest generated by this strategy could (at current APY) help fund the cost of grants at a rate of 10 ETH/month, while exposing the DAO to minimal risk by using a trusted protocol with already $5B in TVL.\n        \n    ![](https://i.imgur.com/RwkzZm0.png)\n        \n2. **LP stETH <> ETH into Balancer and stake into Aura Finance.** Balancer is a popular DEX and Aura Finance is similar to what Convex is to Curve (governance and emissions from Balancer).\n    - **Yield:** High (~8-10% APY currently with $AURA and $BAL emissions). 400 ETH (600K USD) in 1 year.\n    - **Risk:** Low\n        - There are three main risks associated with this strategy:\n            1. stETH depegs. See above.\n            2. Balancer gets exploited: Same reason as Curve above - battle tested DEX + has been operating with hundreds of millions in TVL. \n            - Aura gets exploited: Aura has had extensive audits done to its contracts, works closely with Balancer, does continuous code reviews, and holds $450M+ in TVL.\n        \n    Similar to Strategy #2, we’d be earning additional yield by depositing into a second order protocol. Based on the amount in TVL and the similarity of the smart contracts with Convex, the risk profile is very similar.\n        \n    We would, however, need to sell (harvest) 3 separate tokens. This would potentially increases the gas costs of this strategy, but the rewards being ~3x the Curve strategy would cover any increase in transaction fees.\n        \n    **Strategy #2 Summary:** With this strategy we could generate 32 ETH per month. This would be enough to fund the Nouns Prop House in its current form without any drains on the treasury.\n    \n![](https://i.imgur.com/UBWLngv.png)\n        \n## Timeline + Ask\n\nWe believe implementing these two strategies will be the most fruitful for the pilot program based on risk <> reward. We estimate it will take ~1 month for the implementation of NTM, auditing of contracts, and implementing the new treasury page.\n\nWe are asking for **65ETH** from NounsDAO to implement the above, with an additional **100 ETH + 100 stETH** that would be used to pilot this project (with future expectations to allocate more capital to NTM if the results are favorable). These pilot funds will first be sent to a multi-sig with trusted Nouns members (see below), until the NTM contracts have been audited and deployed.\n\nThe funds will go towards:\n\n- **Contract audit** (30 ETH for C4 audit).\n- ~11 ETH each (3 members) to get this version of NTM into production (implementation + audits) + treasury page. We estimate this will take ~1 month.\n\nFollowing the launch of the pilot program, we’d be requesting:\n\n- 50% of all yields (**no principal**) will go to 1560 studios until we hit **175 ETH.**\n- After we hit 175 ETH, we would take a 2% management fee on further generated yield (no principal).\n\nTo emphasize, we want to profit alongside the DAO, in order to properly align incentives. Rather than making a large ask and risk t, we’d prefer to win if our output is legitimate and positive-sum.\n\nWe’re excited about the idea of working on this, and we hope to deliver a treasury that’s more capital efficient and less dependent on primary sales for funding. **This proposal is the first step in NounsDAO becoming 100% fully self-sustaining.**\n\n## Looking Ahead\n\n1. If the pilot program proves to be profitable and well-received, we will submit another proposal to allocate more stETh to NTM for the current strategies.\n\n2. The team will continue maintaining NTM and researching new strategies alongside Nouners.\n    - We will be actively taking feedback and working with any Nouners that are interested in developing strategies.\n    - A low hanging fruit could be to create a strategy to productionize our lil nouns by LPing them into Sudoswap.\n    - Design and UX is a huge focus for us so we will be constantly improving NTM and the treasury page.\n\n3. Following the initial development of NTM, we want to generalize it as a service (we've acquired [ntm.wtf](http://ntm.wtf) as the domain) for every on-chain treasury. We're going to be actively listening to feedback and speaking with Nouns members about how to build this in a way that properly benefits Nouners and the DAO itself. \n    - Prophouse like plug and play service for other treasuries to generate yield using NTM.\n    - Potential kickbacks back to the DAO for every new DAO integration.\n    - Push NTM to be premier on-chain treasury management service for all DAOs.\n    - To foster conversations about self sustainability, we will be sharing frequent updates of new developments and ideas. \n\n4. Our team is dedicated to building infrastructure and tools that proliferates all things Nounish.

Based on feedback from the community, we’ve reduced the budget significantly, clarified our goals, provided product mockups, and answered open questions.*\n\ntl;dr: We’re asking for 190 ETH to fund 5 months of development for [House of Nouns](https://houseofnouns.wtf) v2. Our MVP has seen tremendous traction, growing 100% each month, and proving to be a critical piece of infrastructure for governance. Now, we’re looking to build the best-in-class pre-proposal client to kill Discourse, create a layer for generating Nounish ideas, open source our core infrastructure, and expand to all Nounish DAOs. This will return value to the DAO via better decisions, increased participation, powerful infrastructure that the community can build on, and proliferation of Nounish governance.\n\nWe believe that governance is THE bottleneck for Nouns’ participation and ultimate success. And we’re here to fix that.\n\nClick here to view this proposal on House of Nouns.\n\n# Background\n[House of Nouns](https://houseofnouns.wtf) was previously funded with 20 ETH through Prop House. Our mission is huge: fix Nouns Governance and empower its contributors.\n\nWe saw tremendous success in our basic MVP from October through December:\n- Discussion on House of Nouns that exists nowhere else\n- Usage (MAUs and pageviews) grew >100% month-over-month \n- Continual expressions of love and support from the community\n- A go-to client that streamlines governance and prop discussion\n\n![HON v1](https://collectivexyz-public.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/HON+v1.png)\n![Prop Debate](https://collectivexyz-public.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Prop+Debate.png)\n[(a debate on Proposal 202)](https://houseofnouns.wtf/proposals/202)\n\n# Deliverables\nOur MVP was just a small part of the vision for House of Nouns: a full suite of supercharged governance tools, for all Nounish DAOs, built on open source infrastructure that anyone can extend.\n\nHere are the key components we’ll build into House of Nouns v2.\n\n**Pre-proposal client.** Discourse is starved of life, and HON v2 will streamline everything that happens before a proposal goes on-chain, saving energy and empowering contributors to do their best work.\n- Rich discussion layer for getting feedback on a draft \n- Inline commenting on specific parts of a draft\n- Templates and multiplayer editor for creating proposal drafts\n- Ability to revise and re-release versions of a draft (like ProductHunt, or this House of Nouns prop) \n- Imported data from Discourse for backwards compatibility\n- One click to promote to on-chain, or have a sponsor do it for you \n- *(Note: see demo at top of prop)*\n\n**Ideas client.** Aligning the DAO on what matters is essential; we want to help contributors know what the DAO is excited about.\n- Reddit-like platform for generating, voting on, and rewarding ideas at the earliest stage\n- Backwards compatibility and integration with Prop Lot API\n- *(Note: see demo at top of prop)* \n\n**Open-source infrastructure** to enable the next 100 governance clients. HON v2 will eliminate all barriers to building on Nouns governance, and improve decentralization. We don’t want to be the last great governance client; we want to be the first of many.\n- API for all governance data, discussion data, Nouner profiles, and more\n- SDK for easy integration of client components to other platforms\n- Frontend repository for House of Nouns website\n- Technical documentation to help new Nounish builders launch their governance apps\n\n**Public good for all Nounish DAOs.** The success of Nouns is directly correlated to the success of Nounish forks; HON v2 will proliferate Nounish governance and drive value back to Nouns through forks (beyond ones created through Nouns Builder, like Lil Nouns, SharkDAO, etc) and branding ⌐◨-◨.\n- See activity from all of your Nounish DAOs in one feed\n- Keep track of all urgent to-dos and notifications across DAOs\n- Full House of Nouns functionality for all future forks of Nouns\n- *(Note: We’ve already been funded by Nouns Builder to support their DAOs. Extending to non-Nouns Builder forks is a minimal effort on our side, and neither of these integrations contribute heavily to this prop’s budget. However, we wanted to ensure that we committed to it explicitly here, because we do see it as an important public good to support a future ecosystem of diverse forks.)*\n\n**First-class integration with other Nounish tools.** HON v2 will be your single looking glass into the rabbit hole of Nounish governance.\n- Agora delegate profile data\n- heyanoun anonymous commenting\n- Federation DAO-to-DAO governance\n- Nouns Atlas search \n\n**New & improved core governance tooling.** You asked and we heard — we’ll be delivering a faster and improved experience on core proposal tooling. This includes an improved UI, much faster loading, notifications for new proposals, enhanced profiles, and other improvements.\n\n**Moving beyond.** We move quickly. While we don’t want to overpromise, we’re also excited to go above-and-beyond with **social media data indexing, contributor profiles, and a post-proposal client** once we ship our core objectives. These will provide richer context and data, more functionality for DAO alignment, and greater transparency for the community.\n\nMost of all, we want to make governance fun and easy instead of a chore.\n\n# Budget, team, and sustainability\nWe’re requesting **190 ETH for 5 months** for full-time development work from the team. After revising our proposal, we believe this is in line with standard service development costs seen in coming out to 9.5 ETH/developer/month.\n\nThis will be spearheaded by:\n- [dadkins](https://twitter.com/dadkins_): longtime crypto hacker\n- [Wojciech Kocjan](https://twitter.com/w_kocjan): frontend & design engineer\n- Jamal Hashim: ex-Amazon, blockchain engineer\n- John Cairns: longtime crypto builder, ex-Gemini\n\nFor the sake of transparency, House of Nouns is by Collective, which is a VC-backed company that has expertise in NFTs and community tooling (previously launched MomentRanks.com and grew community tooling to 50,000+ Flow blockchain users). That being said, we want to make sure this is a self-sustaining and fair investment for the DAO; as such, the end goals include open source infrastructure and self-sustainability for the product, and the budget reflects what we think is a fair pricing for development services.\n\nWe plan to offer bespoke upgrades to other DAOs similar to Red Hat’s monetization model, as well as charging hosting costs for larger communities.\n\nThese upgrades will be built into the broader platform and framework for all users. To reiterate, **Nouns will have permanent access to the product open-source base infrastructure from this proposal, and future upgrades for other DAOs will improve upon this base layer, meaning Nouns receives HON v2 and reaps the benefits of future compatible upgrades.**\n\n# Testimonies\n![Testimony 1](https://collectivexyz-public.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/testimony1.png) \n![Testimony 2](https://collectivexyz-public.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/testimony2.png)\n![Testimony 3](https://collectivexyz-public.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/testimony3.png)\n…and many more <3 ","proposer":"0xB52235DC0751ce6E171C51fbF459fd6637c6ccc8","startBlock":16571818,"endBlock":16607818,"executed":false},"votes":[{"support":1,"voter":"0x231A07C825f052B895DE5FD1513CE40D18E14aF5","numberOfVotes":3,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0xB52235DC0751ce6E171C51fbF459fd6637c6ccc8","numberOfVotes":2,"reason":"I wanted to proactively share some answers to frequent questions we’ve been getting:\n\nAren’t you VC-backed?\nYes, we are. That’s why we’ve geared this prop to deliver an entirely open-source, openly owned codebase — so there is no centralized value capture, and anyone can host, build on top of, and monetize the end deliverables. We think this completely aligns incentives and will help build a strong, open ecosystem.\n\nWhat does open sourcing mean here?\nThis means everything from the repo to the APIs will be open access, so people with varying levels of technical acumen can clone and re-host and build on top of House of Nouns. We’ll also be doing continual data dumps to Arweave for any offchain data.\n\nBudget?\nWhile ETH is going up in price, we’ve decreased our prop’s total cost by ~$100k. We heavily increased deliverables and the speed at which we deliver them. We’re looking for 9ETH/month/developer, which is less than any other active developers for Nouns. We think that deliverables and actual matter the most, and think they are very justifiable for the cost of 190ETH in terms of the long-term impact they can have on the DAO’s success.\n\nIntegrations?\nWe’re looking to be as open and composable as possible. We want to integrate the amazing work of others everywhere it makes sense, versus create clones and replicate any functionality. We want to be a bridge between the disjoint governance infrastructure in the ecosystem.\n\nThank you for your time sers <3"},{"support":1,"voter":"0x3B502B054715A8e0D8F657169615A88B2CCDD429","numberOfVotes":2,"reason":""},{"support":0,"voter":"0x5606B493c51316A9e65c9b2A00BbF7Ff92515A3E","numberOfVotes":28,"reason":""},{"support":0,"voter":"0x4754b7e3DEde42D71d6c92978f25F306176EC7e9","numberOfVotes":7,"reason":""},{"support":0,"voter":"0x17a01dB837345772F2E65Adf2fb4f4DE10ac1B72","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":0,"voter":"0x008c84421dA5527F462886cEc43D2717B686A7e4","numberOfVotes":28,"reason":"1.

Explore future options to enable Nouns community to fabricate physical art.\n\n* * *\n\nABOUT ARTMATR\n=============\n\nArtmatr’s journey began almost eight years ago, by our founder Ben Tritt, an artist who has spent his entire career searching for ways to integrate his love of painting with the digital world. Way before NFTs, Ben visualized a world where painting and digital tools went hand in hand to create unique pieces of art. His journey took him to MIT, where he started exploring different methods of translating digital art into physical pieces through robotics.![](https://imagizer.imageshack.com/img924/3919/s32WMc.jpg)\n\nEventually, these experiments led to several technological products, most notably sophisticated painting robots that can create unprecedented art across different mediums - oil painting, watercolors, airbrush as well as new approaches to digital printing. These capabilities lend themselves to an incredibly flexible fabrication platform that can both mimic artists’ hands through brushstrokes, and create entirely new methods of painting, such as taking code and directly translating it into prints. The fabrication process is intensely creative, given the flexibility of the tools; one piece of art can take on many different forms through the choice of different mediums and variables within the mediums themselves.\n\nArtmatr has already worked with some of the world’s most influential artists, running the gamut of traditional artists such as [Jeff Koons](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.jeffkoons.com/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1675271650908671&usg=AOvVaw2teZ565IDJwwpvUyTTFr6o), to newer digital artists like Beeple and Tyler Hobbs.\n\nOur vision is to allow digital artists and collectors to translate their works into beautiful, one-of-a-kind pieces of art that could be proudly displayed in any gallery. We are currently hard at work developing a software suite that will complement the hardware platform, and are partnering with leading manufacturers with the shared goal of democratizing the creation and sale of physical art.![](https://imagizer.imageshack.com/img922/8170/8g0VQz.jpg)\n\nThe Artmatr Team:\n\nArtmatr was founded by Benjamin Tritt, the company's Chief Creative officer, who has been creating and teaching art for decades at places like the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Musee D'Orsay in Paris, The National Gallery in London, and MIT, and has seen it as his life’s mission to seek ways to unite technology & art. Rafael Feitelberg, Artmatr’s CEO, served as an executive at Tech Fortune 500 companies and has a proven track record of building, scaling and selling startups in Silicon Valley. Rafael has had a lifelong passion for art and holds a B.A. in Art History.\n\nTogether, they have built a diverse team of engineers, business professionals, and artists, who share their vision for creating the industry standard for bridging between digital and physical art.\n\nArtmatr’s Investors:\n\n*   [Delphi Digital](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://delphidigital.io&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1675271650910270&usg=AOvVaw3rt_SvbDLMzIq6fzpmzVuQ): Delphi Digital is the leading research organization for crypto assets. Their research is regarded as an industry standard by institutions and crypto-natives alike. Delphi’s Ventures arm invests in early-stage Web3 startups, protocols, and networks that strive to make crypto happen sooner. Additionally, Delphi Labs incubates and builds protocols and tooling for the DeFi ecosystem.\n\n“We are incredibly excited for the world to see the power of Artmatr’s automated fabrication technology. Artmatr unlocks a new medium for a generation of digitally native artists to express themselves in the physical realm. We believe there is no better collaboration than with Nouns DAO given their commitment to advancing crypto, art and technology.”\n\n*   [Metaversal Ventures](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.metaversal.gg/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1675271650910954&usg=AOvVaw1fxq3HSoosWRt1xTdPZyBR): Metaversal is a holding company focused on the NFT vertical spanning all stages of the market from large corporate brands to individual NFT artists. We deploy a differentiated strategy by investing in the next blue chip NFT assets, supporting NFT infrastructure build out, and acting as an incubator and venture studio to NFT creators. Metaversal partners with brands, creators, content holders, and IP owners to identify, execute, and underwrite evocative NFT projects. Backed by CoinFund, DCG, Galaxy and other leading investors, the Metaversal team is uniquely positioned to identify the requirements for success in the web3 ecosystem and remains platform and blockchain agnostic.\n\n* * *\n\nWHY THIS NEEDS TO HAPPEN\n\n*   Spreading the Word: We believe this collaboration will help spread Nouns through a first of its kind event, bringing together thought leaders from the art world and web3 to celebrate a future where DAOs bring the digital and physical world together\n*   Increase Market Size: Our belief is that by providing a bridge between digital and physical art we can effectively increase the size of both markets. NFT owners will now be able to proudly display the art they own, while physical pieces can be brought on-chain and receive a stronger validation of their provenance\n*   Increase Nouns Prices: By pairing Nouns with beautiful physical pieces, we believe the sales price for each Noun will increase over the period of fabrication. In the past, taking digital pieces into the real world has resulted in 3-10X increase in value for the artists\n*   Leadership: By being the first DAO to bring its assets to the physical world as real art, Nouns will establish itself as leading the charge in showcasing the flexibility of the NFT model and its many applications besides digital-only art\n*   Community-Building: Nouners will be able to to get together and celebrate the community, build relationships, increase the network effects of the DAO, and potentially bringing in new Nouners into the fold\n\n* * *\n\nGOALS OF THIS PROPOSAL\n\nThe following are our goals for this proposal, should it pass:\n\n*   The production of a physical event, exhibiting Nouns art IRL, drawing interest from the local art scene as well as digital enthusiasts and media coverage.\n*   Work with the Nouns community to promote and market this collaboration and ultimately increase sales prices of Nouns\n\n* * *\n\nTIMELINES\n\n*   February 6-March 18, 2023 - Marketing efforts begin, including press releases and videos on social media\n*   March 20, 2023 - Fabrication begins, livestream starts\n\n1.

Already in conversations with iconic musicians and reputable foundations- we will make a major ripple in the lives of musicians, music fans, music education and overall- **Nounish proliferation.** \n\nOver a 6 month period, our goal is to onboard and empower musicians, build upon the existing Noun Sounds platform, create a DAO structure and develop new systems for **musicians and music lovers to create, share and participate in Noun Sounds**- building a self-sustaining community around all things music.\n\n## **Total: 245.5 ETH**\n\n*(See bottom of proposal for funding breakdown)*\n\n## Proposal Outline\n\nFrom January-June 2023, Noun Sounds Pod will:\n\n→  **Empower + Onboard Musicians** \n\n→  **Further Develop Nouns Sounds Platform** \n\n→  **Nounish Partnerships** \n\n→ **Create Noun Sounds DAO**\n\n## Empowering + Onboarding Musicians\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/DvdegTr.jpg)\n\nOne of our top initiatives is to empower musicians through funding and community building.  Our initial conversations include: \n\n- **Large-scale Artist 61ETH**\n    - **Ghostface Killah from Wu-Tang Clan:** *in discussions about making a CC0 song and sound pack for Noun Sounds + a photoshoot with the Noggles glasses.  Ghost has millions of fans and he digs the Noggles.*\n    \n        - *If the collaboration with Ghostface Killah does not happen, the full 61ETH will be sent back to NounsDAO*\n\n- **Indie-artist 23ETH**\n    - **Lisa Caruso:** *A talented indie artist from Australia, Lisa has had her music featured on major network TV shows and has released a slew of cool music and visuals.

Taste-Makers and Curators will be able capture a moment in time and create communities around each of them.\n    - This not only allows artists to create but also empowers one of the most important thing in music: **curation**.\n    - *Each Nouns Player will have the option of creating custom skins for their companion.* Thus, the Playlist Creator will come along with an **Album Art and “Skins” creator tool** for the music player.\n    - These playlists will allow creators and curators to offer token gated content (on their websites or through channels in their discords) based on each of their mintable playlists.\n- **Artist Profiles**\n    - *Artists and creators* will be able to setup their own custom page to showoff their catalogue and give updates. You’ll be able to read about their work, see what packs they’re just released, or check out what playlists are currently minting.\n- **Profesional** **Music Creator Tools**\n    - **VST Instruments:** *Offering tools to experienced musicians*, we will be creating professional instruments that can be used in music-making programs. From keyboards, vocals, synths, drums and more- music makers can download, install and get to making their own Noun Sounds within their existing audio workstation.\n    - **Soundboard:** A fully functional CC0 soundboard on Noun Sounds for use across all Twitter Spaces and more.

It went ok but it hasn't left our bubble yet and the community around it is pre-traction.  As a platform, it's very early and doesn't exist yet.  It doesn't warrant big spending (yet), it's still very much at the experiment level.  It's on this team to prove out much more before it's worth funding more.  It doesn't make sense for the DAO to take experiments and 5x or 10x the funding unless there's strong evidence that it was a clear win.  If this was \"continue to explore Noun Sounds\" and 50 ETH +  20 ETh for a CC0 music Prop House rounds, there'd be something to debate, but after this ask and the strategy, I'd lean No there.\n\nThere is serious issues here with strategy and not understanding that the partnerships with these famous musicians are not only very expensive marketing for a platform that isn't ready for it but also a poor fit for how to build a real organic CC0 focused music community of any kind.  You need people, small people, passionate people who vibe organically and don't need to be paid to vibe.  Find those people, engage them with Noun Sounds, build Noun Sounds and its community with them.  Money doesn't spend for that.\n\nWhen Proposers are getting paid by the DAO in other places, it's helpful and important to lay that out upfront.  The DAO deserves to know, the relationship is already so assymetrical, I expect our partners to be clear and WANT the DAO to be informed.  \n\nI'd also want to see Proposals be transparent when they have relationships with entities they are funding in the Proposal itself.  It would help to know that Woody has a relationship with Save the Music -- it means that execution there is more likely to go more smoothly.  It's also important because the DAO should know when there's the potential for related party transactions. It's small dollars here so it doesn't matter as much right now but STM was also was mentioned in that this team expects funding for future STM proposals, so understanding that relationship is important.  It also highlights the lack of cohesion and focus here -- STM future proposals for even more money but also focusing on expensive celebrity marketing but also working on a pre-traction platform that will live and die by passionate CC0 creators that are not either of the first 2 groups is an odd admixture."},{"support":0,"voter":"0x141b63D93DaF55bfb7F396eEe6114F3A5d4A90B2","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":0,"voter":"0x5ee24Cf78aeB5213F06C4ED718c7bbEF6fe1209E","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":0,"voter":"0x8ac3ecf6973E020cC0E6e8989Fb71B4a77D65987","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":"Reasonings compiled here: https://cbites.substack.com/p/active-governance-noun-582-1"},{"support":0,"voter":"0x5606B493c51316A9e65c9b2A00BbF7Ff92515A3E","numberOfVotes":26,"reason":""},{"support":0,"voter":"0x1D3bc1F9D3f9770453949aBd619592CD7583c5Ed","numberOfVotes":2,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0xa903C06BF35286f6d1cDAD25396748353979a44C","numberOfVotes":2,"reason":"I feel like Nouns has an opportunity to start reaching into the music industry here with this.

(Sufficiently Decentralized) Media Company:\n\n\n\nThe TNS Team is very proud to have produced an engaging and well-attended [Twitter](https://twitter.com/thenounsquare) Spaces Show called Noun O' Clock LIVE **every single day** since June 13, 2022. \n\n## **That's 230+ days in a row!**\n\nWe have hosted many marquee guests during this time such as [Mike Demarais](https://twitter.com/i/spaces/1gqxvyAqvrQJB), [Alana and Jesse from Variant Fund](https://twitter.com/i/spaces/1ypKddjZmwvKW), [Farokh and Mando of

past 6 months, we have accumulated nearly **57K total [Twitter](https://twitter.com/thenounsquare) listens to our spaces,** hosting a total of **580 unique spaces**, including our flagship daily NOC LIVE and a slate of weekly community spaces through a new program called **The SoapBox.**\n\n\n[![twitter-listens-graphic.gif](https://i.postimg.cc/sxtJ87K3/twitter-listens-graphic.gif)](https://postimg.cc/vxt9x1pK)\n*Twitter Spaces Metrics: Up and to the Right*\n\n## What is The Noun Square SoapBox?\n\nThe SoapBox Network was developed by TNS as a way to leverage our platform to provide Nounish communities with a voice, as well as opportunities to cross-pollinate and collaborate with other groups in the ecosystem.\n\n*If The Noun Square is meant to depict an old town plaza with a clocktower in the centre, **The SoapBox** imagery might evoke passionate nounish subcommunities such as [Lil Nouns](https://lilnouns.wtf), [Food Nouns](https://foodnouns.wtf) and [Gnars](https://gnars.wtf) dragging a soapbox into the Square to stand atop and give a rousing speech to their own community of nounsfolk.*\n\nStepping back out of the realm of metaphor, SoapBox is, simply put, a Network that allows any community in the orbit of Nouns to host weekly Twitter Spaces on [The Noun Square Twitter account](https://twitter.com/thenounsquare) (usually co-hosted from their own account), allowing them to bootstrap an audience that is comprised of a mix of their own fans, TNS's unique community, and spillover audiences from other SoapBoxes as well. \n\n[![gami-quote-prop-correct.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/kg2nQDSm/gami-quote-prop-correct.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/68NJwWzj)\n\n[![brennen-testimonial.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/MH6XJkdY/brennen-testimonial.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/gX7G379w)\n*Nouners Gami and Brennen (of Gnars and Nouns Esports respectively) on their experience with SoapBox*\n\n\nAt present, we are hosting approximately **38 Twitter interesting and well-attended spaces per week**, including our daily  Noun O' Clock spaces and the various TNS Soapboxes. \n\n# Twitter Engagement \n\nIn addition to our healthy Twitter Spaces metrics, TNS also has a robust track record of increasing both unique impressions and 100% organic engagement on Twitter, from a combination of art contests and games, as well as cross-posting quality nounish content from other accounts and communities too. \n\n[![twitter-engagement-chart.gif](https://i.postimg.cc/2SWdK01J/twitter-engagement-chart.gif)](https://postimg.cc/Yvpm4fff)\n*Impress-ive Numbers*\n\nAt the time of our previous Proposal, we had achieved 1.2MM impressions across all our posts, and the baseline trend through to present would have carried us to about 3MM impressions. \n\n**In reality, our impression growth has been exponential, with a 5X increase to over 5.4MM in a 5 month period.** (See chart above.) \n\nSimilarly, our Profile Visits were up **4.6X to 446K**, and we completely blew through our previous Proposal goal of 5000 followers, as we are trending towards **close to 6000 Twitter followers as of this proposal.** \n\nHere is a screenshot from Prop 128 showing our year-end goals for Twitter followers and daily Spaces Listens, both of which we have exceeded (6000 vs. 5000 and 380+ vs. 200 respectively):\n\n[![follower-goal.png](https://i.postimg.cc/XvGwCQbx/follower-goal.png)](https://postimg.cc/1gSnx04N)\n\n# Other Media Channels\n\nAlthough the focus of Prop 128 was growing our Twitter Spaces reach and onboarding artists and creators to Nouns, part of our vision for this time was also to begin experimenting with content for other platforms such as YouTube and TikTok, to complement our Twitter content strategy. We have had some success with both of these platforms during this trial, especially on TikTok (where we went viral in December and continue to get great numbers.)\n\n## TikTok\n\n[NounFungibleNikki](https://twitter.com/web3nikki) and [Hypnos](https://twitter.com/hypnoseffect) had been working as a team on a Nounish [TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/@thenounsquare) presence for the NounsNews Project, before that project was discontinued in the fall.\n\nSeeing their impressive efforts and consistency, TNS approached and asked them to join forces and **merge our TikTok accounts together under the TNS banner.** *(Was this the first Nounish Acquisition in history? Maybe not explicitly, but it was nonetheless the beginning of an amazing collaborative relationship that has produced some of our most popular and viral nounish content over the past months.)*\n\nShortly after bringing Nikki and Hypnos into the TNS team, we also saw that [JP](https://twitter.com/eusou_jp) had been getting some really impressive attention on TikToks he had created for a Brazilian Noggle sticker campaign [\"Encontre o adesivo.\"](https://www.tiktok.com/@encontreoadesivo?_t=8ZOeB0NEt9x&_r=1) We invited him to join the team, both to run a Portuguese Language TNS TikTok Account, and to advise Nikki and Hypnos on English language TT content strategy as well.\n\n**Under the guidance of this new team, the growth of our TikTok presence has been nothing short of incredible; from a baseline of 37,000 views in September, to a steady ~100K in October and November, and then spiking dramatically to over 8 million views in the month of December:**\n\n[![tiktok-metrics-prop.gif](https://i.postimg.cc/RVh8YxQ0/tiktok-metrics-prop.gif)](https://postimg.cc/xcrtk7Zr)\n*Exponential TikTok Audience growth.*\n\nA clever video collaboration between JP on the [TNS Brazil account](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMYLkge7F/) and N/H on the [main TNS account](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMYLk4k7G/) managed to go viral twice, one version on each account. After this video (a lighthearted curiosity-hook about nounish tattoos), many of our other videos, including trend videos, interviews and educational shorts, began to accumulate views and organic engagement as well. \n\nFor example, check out this TikTok re-packaging of an [@Nounish video](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMYLkvGGQ/) (with their permission) with **nearly 30K views.** Or this video of Nikki interviewing a [Nouns Vision-wearing Farokh at Art Basel](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMYLkvGGQ/), with **almost 80K views.** Or this [followup to the tattoo video](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMYLkgxjT/) where Nikki explains what Noggles and Nouns are, which has just under **70 thousand views** so far as well. \n\n[![tiktok-thumbnails.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/rFKPygFN/tiktok-thumbnails.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/qzHLjsKN)\n\nWe also ran a very successful Public Good contest on TikTok called **#NounsGiveBack**, calling on our viewers and community to **do something good** in their local community and submit a video showing what they'd done. We had participants from all over the world who submitted some really inspiring entries. \n\nThe hashtag #NounsGiveBack on TT has received **over 300K views** across our own posts and all of the entries to date. A 2-minute recap video summarizing many of the amazing submissions has received **over 32.5K views** as well, [you can watch it here.](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMYLkb4JM/) We are planning to launch a second Public Good contest as well in the coming weeks using the same hashtag. \n\nAt present, both TNS TikTok accounts have amassed over 30,000 combined unique followers, over 850K \"Likes\" across our videos, and nearly 8.5MM total views on all videos. For more metrics, our TikTok team has prepared a short deck that provides some additional details and insights [here.](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1d_ezmaSVbTC345t0W33Py_PmIXrVdXrTO9xnxPYalIY/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n**This is a huge opportunity to proliferate Nouns, especially to a younger generation of artists and builders, and we are excited to see what the TNS TikTok Dream Team can achieve over the next 6 months with a renewed mandate and continued enthusiasm.**\n\n## YouTube\n\nWe have also begun some experimentation on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@thenounsquare) in 3 main ways during this proposal period: \n1) Streaming all notable Twitter Spaces to YT Live for alternate tune-in and listen-back options; \n2) Creating and hosting evergreen/educational nounish video content; and \n3) Hosting/re-hosting of co-branded video content from other nounish projects such as House of Nouns and Nouns AI. \n\n[![youtube-examples.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/xCt8cB1X/youtube-examples.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/TL5fs7mx)\n\nOur [YT Live streams](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VSleWkgQ8_s) of daily Twitter Spaces have picked up an extra 20-30 daily listens on average, while also serving as a more permanent living archive of our Twitter content (helpful since Twitter deletes Spaces Recordings after 90 days.)\n\nSome examples of our evergreen content would be the [\"Nounsplaining Web3 Terms\"](https://youtu.be/6Tu56yn6MoA) series with Aubtoshi and SuperTightWoody, and the [\"Prop House Profiles\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UY6_cpQZBpc) interview series with Toady Hawk. In both cases, these series have been produced in a way that they can be viewed either today or in 5 years and still be relevant. As we grow, especially in new mediums like video, having a healthy repertoire of interesting educational content is valuable, as new eyeballs arrive on our accounts and will be immediately greeted by helpful onboarding content.\n\nFinally, our co-branded content strategy: For example, [House of Nouns' thoughtful weekly Voter Companion show \"Prop Talk\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJe17dn9TIk&t=5s) was premiered on our YT channel in addition to their other podcast services, resulting in more views for their content and more useful content for our audience. The same can be said for Recordings of the [AI Pod weekly Discord calls.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJe17dn9TIk&t=5s) \n\nWe know that YouTube continues to be a great opportunity for future growth, and we plan to devote more resources to building out our presence and content on this platform over the coming months. \n\n\n# 2) The Noun Square as an Onboarding and Community Hub\n\nOver the past 6 months, TNS has cemented itself as a pillar of the Nouns DAO community, supporting funded projects and sub-DAOs alike, while also welcoming builders, artists and new Nouners to the DAO with open arms.      \n\n**In our estimation, this role of providing Community-As-A-Service to the DAO is every bit as important as the proliferation and distribution role outlined in the previous section.**\n\n[![tns-discord-members.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/43Qgvwch/tns-discord-members.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/940KCdJW)\n\nAfter the original Nouns discord was switched to read-only, we worked to embrace the diaspora and create a guidepost to the Nouniverse. We thoughtfully did this in our Discord server and on TNS shows, so as not to simply try and replicate what was just disbanded, but rather create a neutral space where people can learn more at their own pace and find their own way to get more involved in the Nouns ecosystem. As a result, with **966 members**, our TNS Discord is now one of the largest (if not *the* largest) active nounish servers by membership. \n\n\n\n## More Info About The SoapBox Network \n\n[![the-soapbox-network-graphic-copy.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/QdTsWCbL/the-soapbox-network-graphic-copy.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/75wjFxdX)\n\nOver the course of this past funding period, our **SoapBox Network** has grown from nothing into a weekly itinerary of 38+ spaces that have provided a turn-key platform to 15+ nounish projects and communities including *Shark DAO, Lil Nouns DAO, Lil Sisters Fund, Nouns esports, Food Nouns, Nouns Builder, UMA DAO, Gnars DAO, Nouns Africa, Nouns DAO Amigos, Nouns Brasil, InternatioNouns, Nouns Agora, House of Nouns, NounBA, Lil Toadz DAO / Cryptoadz and more.* \n\nThis initiative has empowered these nounish communities to consistently engage their membership on a weekly basis, cross-pollinate and collaborate with each other. It has also helped TNS greatly in our role of onboarding new people to Nouns, allowing our team to often say to newcomers: *\"Just spend a week listening to TNS Spaces and you will find your nounish people.\"*\n\n\n## **SoapBox is a true symbiotic \"Win-Win-Win-Win\" arrangement:** \n\n* Nouns DAO benefits from a passionate and interconnected web of communities, all employing different strategies to proliferate the ⌐◨-◨ meme to different demographics. \n* The Noun Square benefits from additional engaging content for our various distribution streams and from having multiple active funnels from which to grow our own community. \n* SoapBox partners benefit from a turn-key solution to host spaces with minimal planning or coordination required on their part, and the opportunity to reach new eyeballs from different corners of the ecosystem. \n* And finally, the Nouns community at large benefits from a full daily slate of Nounish content and a one-stop-shop to catch up on everything happening in the Nouniverse.  \n\n[![nounsamigos-quote-prop.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/VNZ2K6bg/nounsamigos-quote-prop.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/VSM76zg0) *A bilingual testimonial from Nouns DAO Amigos about their experience as a SoapBox partner.*\n\nIn addition to empowering nounish sub-DAOs, subcultures and communities, the SoapBox Network has also been a powerful tool for TNS to help other funded nounish projects with their DAO communications and user growth. Some examples:\n\n* We have partnered with **[Nouns Agora](https://nounsagora.com/)** to co-host **[weekly public DAO discussions and townhalls](https://twitter.com/thenounsquare/status/1604658668007718912?s=20&t=XqFEz89ZZsqi1CbnriseCA)** about Nouns DAO Proposals that have produced very interesting dialog and have been very well attended and received. [Yitong](https://twitter.com/zhayitong) from Agora had this to say about TNS's efforts: \n\n[![agora-quote-prop.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/qBLSFNrr/agora-quote-prop.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/YjvdGqjD)\n* We hosted a **[Technical Townhall about Rage Quit](https://twitter.com/thenounsquare/status/1604965283478884382?s=20&t=XqFEz89ZZsqi1CbnriseCA)** with The Verbs team of Elad and David, which also was very well attended and was the venue for some very important conversations between 4156, VapeApe, 0xHindsight, DigitalOIl and others. \n* We have partnered with **[House of Nouns](https://houseofnouns.xyz/)** on two fronts: 1) Hosting co-branded video versions of their weekly voter companion podcast \"Prop Talk\" on The Noun Square YouTube (amplified on our Twitter), and 2) Hosting a live discussion SoapBox by the same name on Twitter Spaces weekly. [Christian](https://twitter.com/ByHardy) from HoN shares his experience here: \n\n[![house-of-nouns-quote.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/FspsFFQg/house-of-nouns-quote.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/w7td0pM7)\n\n* We have hosted on many occasions \"PopUp Soapboxes\" by request for several Nounish projects, such as:\n    1) [A Bud Light NEXT Happy Hour](https://twitter.com/thenounsquare/status/1612847677330554880?s=20&t=XqFEz89ZZsqi1CbnriseCA) (which was very well attended - we are in the process of potentially turning into a regular event.) \n    2) A [Basketball X Nouns event](https://twitter.com/thenounsquare/status/1615211446454943745?s=20&t=XqFEz89ZZsqi1CbnriseCA) in collaboration with [NounBA](https://twitter.com/nounba_wtf) and [Vesselverse](https://twitter.com/VesselVerse). \n    3) A [Bilingual Chinese-English space](https://twitter.com/thenounsquare/status/1601052527029817345?s=20&t=XqFEz89ZZsqi1CbnriseCA) featuring Noun 74 and the Chinese Cryptopunks community, which was also simulcast on Binance Live. \n    \n[![nounba-quote-prop.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/FzbQ1pdn/nounba-quote-prop.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/zHfQcnkn)\n\n**We believe that, again, in the absence of a centralized Nouns Discord, providing a public and neutral space for discussion of Nouns Proposals and DAO governance is an important and powerful part of our mandate that we hope to nurture and grow in the coming months.**\n\n\n## On-Boarding New Nouners to the DAO\n\nAnother aspect of our daily community-building efforts is our consistent commitment to reaching out and engaging with folks on Twitter, Twitter Spaces, TikTok, etc. to answer their questions about Nouns and explain how they can get involved.  \n\n**We have also reached out to new Nouners on a weekly basis to invite them on the daily Noun O' Clock show as guests and help them introduce themselves to the community.** We have had many new Nouners on the show including *Taco Noun, Digital Oil, shan96, darlington, 0xpiney, susuc, pNouns, NickyG, Nounvestment Fund, Variant Fund, Valko*, and more. Invariably they have all had positive feedback about their experience! \n\nA couple recent examples: \n\n[![monstercat-quote-prop.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/BQ2Nj6Sy/monstercat-quote-prop.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/mt27qTFN)\n\n[![digital-oil-quote-prop.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/DZMSB2xK/digital-oil-quote-prop.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/vg58mdRP)\n \n\n## The FOMO Factor\n\nTNS has also had a tangible effect on Nouner onboarding with our efforts to coordinate FOMO every night on our Noun O' Clock LIVE Twitter Spaces. In several instances, we have been asked by people to try to FOMO mint a specific Noun head, which we have done successfully and then this has often directly resulted in said Noun being purchased. *Nouns 404, 433, 453, 472, 487, 506, 532, 542, 552, 562, 569, 577 & 578 (to name a few) are all examples of Nouns we FOMO'd by request and were purchased as a result.* \n\n[![modrovsky-quote-prop.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/MpmXg095/modrovsky-quote-prop.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/LJhH1PKg)*Modrovsky, on his experience asking TNS to FOMO him an Index Card head.*\n\nWe believe playing FOMO every day has led to minting more aesthetic nouns on average also, and as part of the fun, we aim to mint nouns for cultural events and occasions too. For example, we minted a rabbit for Chinese New Year (while hosting Nouns DAO China), 2 Rose Buds for the Rose Parade, a snowman head on Christmas day, and a basketball, knowing that the nouns acquisition committee were likely to want one for [Victor](https://twitter.com/victorsolomon)'s basketball court restoration proposal.\n\n[![fomo-time.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/76cKQs5L/fomo-time.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/hzL8X0bF)\n*FOMO comic strip by TNS community member @Kimmydeuk*\n\n## On-Boarding Artists and Contributors to Nouns\n\nBy encouraging artistic expression and rewarding creation through our weekly community art contests, The Noun Square has prompted the creation of 1000's of Nounish illustrations, sculptures, food items, videos, costumes and more.\n\nUsing TNS as a launch-pad, artists from around the world have entered into the Nouniverse and have found great success. Artists that started with TNS contests have been commissioned by Nouns communities, minted their own collections, been featured in IRL exhibitions and other collections, and have begun collaborating with each other as well:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/VZKy0me.jpg)\n*Special Holiday Edition mint by @0xaprilia, @ilustradoraeth, @DesenhistaRedn, @amiyoko_eth, @facuserif, @Greta_gremplin, @Messhup, many of whom were exposed to Nouns via TNS*\n\nAfter winning our contests, many artists have had the opportunity to work with us on art inspired by the daily Noun that we give away as POAPs on our Twitter Spaces. Each commissioned artist does 7 or 8 pieces of art for that week. Some examples of the 230+ POAPs we have given out since inception:\n\n[![poap-compilation-gif.gif](https://i.postimg.cc/LX6zHr5v/poap-compilation-gif.gif)](https://postimg.cc/Ff8fpCjJ)\n\nAnd here's a brief reel showing many of the beautiful Nounish art pieces created by our community members over the past months:\n\n[![contest-supercut.gif](https://i.postimg.cc/3NdxD2cG/contest-supercut.gif)](https://postimg.cc/D43T94Ff) \n\n## A Few TNS Artist Success Stories:\nAfter being introduced to Nouns via one of our earliest art contests, talented South Korean artist [Jhee](https://twitter.com/jheeart_nft) has gone on to mint collections including her popular watercolor-styled \"With Noun\" collection. Her art is really beautiful:\n\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/MtqCAsM.jpg)\n\n\nShe has also been featured in IRL galleries, created merchandise and hosted her own exhibitions! \n\n\n[Arash](https://twitter.com/ArashSlacker), an Iranian animator living in Turkey, was on-boarded by several members of the TNS team. He premiered his [Shrimpy Burger Nouns](https://youtu.be/nQIsqHWERoE) music video on TNS YouTube, collaborated with Nouns Sounds on [\"The Bomb\"](https://youtu.be/cQjWXc2EHQk) music video, is creating a pretty cool [Nouns Video Game](https://youtu.be/Xz-ouU8xErE), and more.\n\n[![arash-gif.gif](https://i.postimg.cc/HnLFfjVm/arash-gif.gif)](https://postimg.cc/WFQ9ZNGY)\n\n\n[0xAprilia](https://twitter.com/0xaprilia) came to Nouns via TNS art contests and has launched their own collections, created artwork for Nouncil, helped with multiple Nouns Proposals' art, and will be a resident artist at boards.wtf as well. Some of her art:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/BJthO5e.jpg)\n\n[Duckhead](https://twitter.com/_duckhead) entered into an [Unminted Noun Heads](https://twitter.com/thenounsquare/status/1565289442302099456?s=20&t=8XVpnHHkMX1IvWAgeqFRsg) contest and created a beautiful Box Noun Resin Figurine, which later was produced and sold out its initial order. They've continued to create more Nouns as figures and create one of a kind Nouns resin art!\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/nF7SFbT.jpg)\n\n\nIn addition to empowering hundreds of artists, TNS has also funded social goods efforts around the world with challenges like our [Cleanup Contest](https://twitter.com/thenounsquare/status/1567969949829693440), which inspired community cleanup efforts the world over. One of the winners of this competition, [Davin](https://twitter.com/davinoyesigye), **went on to be funded by Nouns Prop House to do a larger cleanup effort, and then eventually founded Nouns DAO Africa as a result of these initiatives!**\n\n## Two Successful Trial Prop House Rounds:\n\nTo complement our efforts to fund Nounish artists through our consistent Twitter art contests, we wanted to allocate a portion of our Prize budget to pilot [two Prop House Rounds](https://prop.house/the-noun-square) to extend the same kind of support to other creators and builders in our community. \n\nWe coordinated two rounds, one with 5 prizes of 2 ETH each, and one with 10 prizes of 1 ETH. In both cases, we were very impressed with the quantity and quality of submissions. In fact, there were so many quality submissions, we ended up awarding a total of 3 extra Bonus Prizes as well. We received 63 proposals over both rounds, and here are just a few of the projects that were funded and have executed:\n\n* A team that created a [substack newsletter](https://prop.house/the-noun-square/round-1/1727) to post summaries of every Noun O' Clock LIVE Twitter Spaces for those who missed. \n* A Portuguese language Twitter Spaces called *Bora Buildar Brasil*  that is airing [weekly on TNS SoapBox](https://twitter.com/thenounsquare/status/1613830382323105793?s=20&t=8XVpnHHkMX1IvWAgeqFRsg).\n* A collection of [custom made resin trophies](https://prop.house/the-noun-square/round-1/1714) made by [Duckhead](https://twitter.com/_duckhead) in the image of the TNS mascot \"Nouny Clock.\" \n* A [series of animated shorts](https://twitter.com/MALCOM_ERANDA/status/1586408060171747330?s=20&t=8XVpnHHkMX1IvWAgeqFRsg) based on memorable clips from our Twitter Spaces shows. \n* A [tree planting operation](https://twitter.com/NounsCare) in the Philippines. \n* & many more!\n\n\n\n\n# 3) Project Goals For The Next 6 Months\n\nThese are the goals and target metrics we will strive to achieve over the next 6 months:\n\n**Broad Strategic Goals:**\n* Continue our unbroken consistent streak of Noun O' Clock Twitter Spaces as an important daily touchpoint for the community, and effective onboarding funnel for people new to Nouns. We will continue to keep our Spaces content engaging and interesting, and pursue bigger guests even more regularly to draw in larger crowds and continue/accelerate our current trend of growth.\n* Increase production of educational/evergreen video content for YouTube, and concentrate on continued growth of YouTube following and engagement.\n* Continue to build and grow the TNS TikTok accounts followers and engagement in both English and Portuguese.  \n* Continue to offer distribution and DAO communications support to Nounish projects such as Agora, House of Nouns and Nouns AI + providing support and additional distribution for Aubtoshi's Nouns On The Air Podcast Series.  \n* Maintain and grow the SoapBox network, including expanding it to some communities on the periphery of Nouns and possibly suitable communities outside the ecosystem. \n* Continue to make a concerted effort to reach out to all new Nouners and invite them on NOC LIVE + help them orient themselves in the DAO as best we can. \n* Host and moderate thoughtful DAO discourse on Proposals on a weekly basis.\n* Continue to ideate and administer creative art contests that produce positive social media engagement and amazing User Generated Content, plus attracts and onboards talented artists from around the world into the ecosystem.  \n* Continue to experiment with and document decentralized project management and team compensation (all team comp disbursed by recurring retro rounds according to contribution and/or grants for specific projects completed.) \n* Experiment with alternate language versions of TNS Twitter, as we have been trialing with a TNS Spanish and TNS Portuguese Account. \n* Be a leader in the Nouns space on the front of finding paths toward sustainability (more on this in the \"Sustainability Strategy\" section below.)\n\n**Specific Metric Goals:**\n\n* Grow Twitter following to minimum 11K over the next 6 months (which would make our account the largest nounish project account by followers after @nounsdao)\n* Grow total Twitter impressions to 20MM+\n* Grow total Listens metric to 120K+\n* Organically grow YouTube subscribership to 690+ with consistent and quality content (minimum 2 pieces of video content per week.)\n* Build TNS TikTok accounts to 50K+ combined followers and 12MM+ combined views. (Target of 200 videos posted with consistent cadence over the next 6 months.)  \n* Allocate 70+ ETH to builders and artists through art contests/commissions and community project funding. \n* Challenge ourselves to raise 50ETH in revenue over the next 6 months to defray our operations budget with a combination of crypto-native and media-native experiments (more on this in the \"Sustainability Strategy\" section below.)\n* Onboard at least one new artist to Nouns per month through contests, POAP commissions or other community initiatives. \n* Land strategic partnerships with at least two brands/communities outside the Nouns ecosystem. \n\n\n# 4) The Team\n\n**The Noun Square continues to operate with a novel decentralized project management system loosely based on the original Nouncil governance documents.** Members of both the Core and Support teams can rotate in and out as needed, depending on schedule and commitments, allowing others to step in and step up as needed. All compensation is calculated by periodic retro round allocations, or by specific project-based grants. \n\nThis format has allowed interested community members to land in TNS from a contest or a Twitter space, start contributing, and then become part of the Support Team or even the Core Team based on nothing but merit, effort and output. \n\nRunning the daily operations of TNS is no small task and encompasses myriad responsibilities, including but not limited to: \n\n*Production and planning for daily NOC show, Administration of SoapBox Spaces, schedule and coordination of Hosting and co-hosting of daily show, creation, editing and publication of YouTube and TikTok content, general content ideation and strategy, POAP artist coordination and administration, POAP creation and delivery, contest ideation, administration and execution, tracking and administration of contest prizes and payments, retro round administration and payroll, administration of Prop House rounds, booking guests for all shows, Twitter and other social engagement, maintaining Show schedule and Tweeting Spaces daily, onboarding conversations, business and partnership development, Discord management and moderation etc.*\n\n**Core Team (And most Common Responsibilities):**\n* [Toady Hawk](https://twitter.com/toady_hawk) (Founder, project management & Strategy, Twitter management, Space hosting, Coordination/Administration, Business development) \n* [Aubtoshi](https://twitter.com/aubtoshi_nft) (Space hosting, video content, coordination/administration)\n* [Benbodhi](https://twitter.com/benbodhi) (High Level Strategy, POAP coordination, Contest Payments, Co-hosting, Discord/YouTube admin)\n* [Joshua Fisher](https://twitter.com/JoshuaFisher) (Contest ideation and coordination, Hosting, High Level Strategy)\n* [SuperTightWoody](https://twitter.com/SuperTightWoody) (Discord admin, High Level Strategy, music)\n* [Xargs](https://twitter.com/mamaxargs) (SoapBox scheduling, backend administration of scheduling, international channel moderation and international community outreach)\n* [RobotFishGirl](https://twitter.com/RobotFishGirl) (Hosting, discord moderation, video content editing)\n* [Noun 142](https://twitter.com/1fortytwo) (Founder, Advisor, High Level Strategy)\n\n**Support Team (And most common tasks):**\n* [Symbiotech](https://twitter.com/Symbiotech) (Administration, Discord content, Twitter Spaces technical hosting)\n* [Al409](https://twitter.com/7x7x7eth) (Hosting most SoapBox spaces, general administration as needed)\n* [Cardno](https://twitter.com/CardnoNFT) (Guest management, space hosting)\n* [NounFungible Nikki](https://www.tiktok.com/@nonfungiblenikki) (TikTok strategy, content creation and development)\n* [Hypnos](https://twitter.com/hypnoseffect) (Tiktok content strategy and video editing)\n* [JP](https://twitter.com/eusou_jp) (TikTok content strategy and creation, Portuguese language TT and Twitter account)\n* PooPiePie (YouTube streaming)\n* [Santhosh](https://twitter.com/vellayan_0) (Essential Non-North American hours administration and scheduling, SoapBox Hosting)\n* [Satori](https://twitter.com/0xSatori) (Administration, support, guest booking)\n* [Akva](https://twitter.com/Akva556) (Portuguese language support, hosting)\n* [BK](https://twitter.com/0xbk_) (Reports)\n* [Prof Werder](https://twitter.com/ProfWerder) (Twitter admin and hosting)\n* [Kyro Wolf](https://www.instagram.com/kyrowolf/) (Art, branding and design)\n* [Jhee](https://twitter.com/jheeart_nft) (art)\n* [Volky](https://twitter.com/volkyeth) (NOMO dev / big brain)\n\nWe have also kept public records of every single retro round we have completed for team compensation to date (to our knowledge we are the only Nouns-funded project to have provided this level of operational transparency). Nouners are welcome to review the document [here](\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-zmEFFLxUszyKZzo8CJP6KlXC581NkPLtek4GN6h7T8/edit#gid=977336365).\n\n# 5) Proposed Budget:\n\n**Monthly expenditures August-Present:**\n*Team Comp and misc operations: 38 ETH\nContest Prizes, art commissions, community project grants: 12 ETH\n(We continued operations through January as a bonus)*\n\n**New Budget:**\nMonthly Team Compensation Budget: 42 ETH \nMonthly contest Prizes, community art commissions, community project grants: 11.17 ETH\n\n*Total Ask Per Month = 53.17 X 6 Month term = 319 ETH (Before Sustainability Efforts, See Below.)*\n\n# 6) Sustainability Strategy \n\nThere has been some discussion in the DAO recently about the self-sustainablity of Nouns-funded projects. Notably, Nounder 4156 mentions here on Twitter that many beloved Nounish projects could be endangered in the medium-to-long term if they don't think seriously about a path to sustainability.  \n\n[![4156-sustainability.png](https://i.postimg.cc/CLbF2Yxg/4156-sustainability.png)](https://postimg.cc/KRvSK6Tq)\n\nThat is why at TNS, we are implementing a 2-pronged strategy to gradually reduce our dependence on DAO funding, while continuing to bring value to the DAO and the community at large. In addition to reasonable DAO funding for provision of Community-As-A-Service and growing media distribution, we will also try:\n\n1) Crypto-Native experiments in self-funding; and\n2) Traditional Media experiments in self-funding.\n\n**To reduce our total ask of the DAO, we are challenging ourselves to produce 50 ETH of revenue through a combination of a) NOMO Nouns daily edition mints, b) a TNS Nouns Fork using Builder DAO that celebrates talented artists in our community, and c) tiered sponsorship opportunities of our media channels.**\n\n\n## A) NOMO NOUNS: A TNS-Developed Addition to the FOMO Experience \n\n\nNOMO NOUNS is a gamified daily edition mint, bootstrapped and developed in-house by TNS (shout out [Volky.eth](https://twitter.com/volkyeth).) It kicks off directly after FOMO Nouns and allows our audience on Noun O' Clock LIVE to pick one Noun that got passed over during FOMO (and is soon to be NO MO'), and save it from eternal blockchain purgatory by clicking like mad.  \n\n[![nomo.gif](https://i.postimg.cc/sDwMSTgB/nomo.gif)](https://postimg.cc/KRvSK6Tq)\n\n[![9999-nomo-testimonial.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/jSsDP21Z/9999-nomo-testimonial.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/mt5ZGLBH)\n\nOnce the game is over (about 60 seconds), the winning NOMO Noun is minted as a 24H open edition that is very affordable, but goes up in price every 15 minutes thereafter. So far in the first 6 weeks of beta, the feedback from our community has been overwhelmingly positive. People love the game, and have been minting the NOMOs even though we haven't fully developed either the game or the usefulness of the NFTs yet (it's currently mostly just for fun and *provenance.*) \n\n\n\n**We have raised over 7 ETH from NOMO so far, and all proceeds have gone directly to the TNS treasury (which allowed us to operate for a bonus month in January.)**\n\n[![41-nomo-comment.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/HL1HFz7B/41-nomo-comment.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/YvRJW1RW)\n\nAdditionally, our TNS partner dev **Volky** is currently working on several improvements to the game and interface, and NOMO V2 will be released very soon. **Our vision is for NOMO to become an efficient single landing page for listeners of Noun O' Clock LIVE and beyond, and we're excited to roll out new features soon to that end.** In the meantime, just keep on clickin'!\n\n## B) TNS DAO\n\nIn the next 30-45 days, we plan to launch a TNS DAO by forking Nouns using Nouns Builder. We have some exciting plans in motion to partner with and empower some of the incredible artists in our TNS community. We also have novel plans to integrate NOMO Nouns owners into the structure of the DAO, and ultimately envision a future in the medium-term where auction proceeds can net out the cost of much of our contest prizes and community project grants, in a true virtuous cycle of art and proliferation.   \n\n## C) Sponsorships \n\nWe are currently in discussions with several crypto-native organizations about potential secondary sponsorships (after Nouns DAO) of our Twitter Spaces, as well as video content on our YT and TikTok. We are working to balance the traditional media model with a more crypto-native approach to sponsorship, and with any confirmed partner collaborations, we will ensure that both the partner and our audience benefit mutually and safely. \n\n**With the three initiatives above, we believe we can meet our goal of raising 50 ETH in revenue over a 6 month period, and we are excited both for the challenge, and to set an example in the DAO as a project seeking paths to semi-self-reliance.**\n\n# 7) The Revised Ask\n\n## Projected 6 Month Operations Budget of 319 ETH, minus 50 ETH of targeted TNS revenue = **269 ETH Total Ask**\n\n\n\n# 8) Conclusion \nTo sum it all up, The Noun Square is a growing media hub and onboarding/educational platform for Nouns DAO and the Nouniverse. We aim to bring value to existing and new people through many impactful initiatives, as outlined in this proposal, and we will continue to iterate and improve daily (the beauty of creating nounish media every single day.)\n\n**The detailed metrics and information in this prop are important and demonstrate the tangible value that TNS brings to the broader Nouns community. But numbers and details can also be overwhelming in a world of information overload.** Numbers and details don’t tell the whole story. We hope that this prop and the discussion around the funding and sustainability of TNS will allow you to see and hear the story of what we’ve been able to build alongside our audience: **an onboarding hub for the Nouniverse, and a cc0 media company, kickstarted by Nouns.**\n\nWhat ESPN’s Sportscenter is to most sports fans, that’s the role TNS is playing for many currently in their Nounish journey. And it will continue to hold that place as the next 1000 come into the Nouniverse, and the 1000 after that. This prop can’t properly tell the stories of many artists who went from relative obscurity to sustainable work thanks to their onboarding to Nouns. The prop can’t tell of the 50 builders who were either ushered into Prop House victories for the first time, or brought onto the TNS team as their first chance to work in web 3, or who found people to create and build alongside in a nounish subdao, thanks to TNS. \n\nIt can't tell how TNS was a springboard to new ventures in the Nouniverse. How we were a shot of energy into the proliferation stars of NounsDAO Brazil, or Africa. **And the prop can’t tell the story of 100+ who have found their footing in web3, found their tribe in the Nouniverse, and will find themselves on a Nounish web3 journey for years to come.** \n\nThese people are the next stars of the Nouniverse. They are future Nouners, too. And to be honest, they are the real stars of TNS. This prop can’t tell all those stories. For those who are not a part of the TNS orbit, we hope the discussion of this prop during the on-chain period allows you to hear that human story alongside the numbers and the metrics, so that you get a feel for the full picture of the value of TNS to the Nouniverse.\n\n## Thank you for your time!\n\n\n# 9) A Special Edition TNS X Messhup Mint\nUpon successful execution of this proposal, \"The Meta-Square,\" a special TNS-inspired edition by Messhup, will be minted by the TNS Deployer to mark the occasion and at the same time offer a beautiful collectible piece to all our supporters (and detractors?) \n\nThis mint will be open for 5 days after execution of the Prop (if passed) at a cost of 0.0420 ETH each (for the culture.) Half the proceeds will go to TNS, half will be returned to the DAO.  \n\n# 10) The Transactions & Multisig\n\n* One transaction of 269 ETH to the TNS Multisig (3/5), consisting of trusted community members who have been serving on said MS since August/2022: Toady Hawk, Noun 142, Benbodhi, SuperTightWoody & Maty.eth. \n* One transaction which will mint Messhup's \"The Meta-Square\" as a Timed Open Edition on Zora upon execution of the Prop.\n\n","proposer":"0x31A50FD42b910c635e4d25B63b7b90FAd1451695","startBlock":16579547,"endBlock":16615547,"executed":true},"votes":[{"support":1,"voter":"0x8ac3ecf6973E020cC0E6e8989Fb71B4a77D65987","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":"Reasonings compiled here: https://cbites.substack.com/p/active-governance-noun-582-1"},{"support":1,"voter":"0x3B502B054715A8e0D8F657169615A88B2CCDD429","numberOfVotes":2,"reason":""},{"support":0,"voter":"0x5bA0609f71e616dCD0A76aB018EB7d87b4Be8666","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":"At the most basic level I just can’t see how we can logically or reasonably justify the continued spending on TNS at the scale being asked for in this proposal based on the results demonstrated so far. \nRunning twitter spaces (or a media company) at a cost of over $1m a year – taking the metrics given in the prop itself, doesn’t add up for me. $1m+ a year is an absolutely massive amount of money for something like this. \n\nWhen we try and gauge how TNS is doing I think we should look at the flagship NOC show as a barometer of performance…the flagship show should be just that. The data for this specific show should be fairly clear but It isn’t. It seems to get <100 people on it.\n\nI do think Toady is genuinely trying to build a Nounish media company BUT at the same time I do not think that it is working in its current format nor can it bring value anywhere near what is being spent under the current model or the one proposed in the prop. \n\nThe core team on TNS consists of 8 people. 6 of these members works together over multiple projects and between those 6 people they will have received somewhere between $4.5 and $5m in funding if these proposal pass. This isn’t to pass judgement on anything here apart from to say it’s a lot money for a team that all work together (in tns, nouncil, uglydao). It just is to illustrate the points above, to show there is a focus outside of tns too from the core team and to warn against the centralization of all media control among any team. \n\nTNS has a place in Nouns and I think Toady should be funded for TNS. But it should have a clear focus on its main show - Nouns O Clock. All efforts should be singularly directed on building up that show, getting an audience inside and outside nouns. It should have a much smaller core team and a budget of around 100-150k (which is a lot of money to build a spaces or podcast on top of the 600k already received!)\n\nBefore we talk about building a media company let’s focus on doing that one thing and one thing well. \n\nIs this a hell yes? No- Not in its current form.\n\nHindsight"},{"support":1,"voter":"0x021edd67d43B365a6401a5Ee704Aa6f264F3F4e4","numberOfVotes":3,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x5ca6a2e5f53a48616d4ead87fF6034fc032D4722","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":"you're on a different road, I'm in the Honky Way\nyou want me down on Earth, but I honk in space\nyou're so damn hard to please, we gotta honk this switch\nyou're from the '70s, but I'm a '90s HONK"},{"support":1,"voter":"0xa903C06BF35286f6d1cDAD25396748353979a44C","numberOfVotes":2,"reason":"⌐◨-◨ "},{"support":0,"voter":"0x1D3077F87EE7b08217E22f65FBe014ed06E51ddf","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":"cost-inefficient"},{"support":1,"voter":"0xB2A09D83fcA93eeDE41DEF88b6BA27fC716f1BfD","numberOfVotes":0,"reason":"Great team with a ton of experience and huge network of resources here!"},{"support":1,"voter":"0xeb13fdDFA9B2A4a6E4e7B2D67b6E38C208C41249","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":"I'm on board for now - I think much of the value-add is the consistency of the product.

Resulting in a community that feels less connected to Nouns, because they cannot participate directly in the governance process.\n\n**Federation closes this gap by providing a way for communities to directly vote on Nouns proposals onchain. We call this crossDAO governance.**\n\n[![goal](https://i.postimg.cc/DwhF0yv3/Untitled.png)](https://postimg.cc/VdK2Hw0K)\n\nMoving forward we are extending Federation to support all forms of governance in the ecosystem such as integrating with Prop House and Nouns Builder, while also providing opportunities for owners of Nouns to generate value from them through new experiments like vote bidding.\n\nTo do this, we are seeking 225 ETH in funding to continue the development of Federation.\n\n# Team \n[wiz](https://twitter.com/0xWiz_) - creator [federation](https://federation.wtf); [Wizards DAO](https://wizardsdao.com); [delegate](https://www.nounsagora.com/delegate/oxwiz.eth);\n\n[ripe](https://twitter.com/ripe0x) - Nounish builder and [delegate](https://www.nounsagora.com/delegate/ripe0x.eth). Designer, and developer with over 15 years of experience creating digital products & websites and winner of multiple Nouns Prop House rounds. A few Nounish contributions include: [Nouns Explore on nouns.wtf](https://nouns.wtf/explore), [Nounish CV (prototype)](https://nounish.netlify.app/), [nogs.wtf,](https://www.nogs.wtf/) [zorggles.wtf](http://zorggles.wtf/), [Noggle Factory](https://www.nogglefactory.wtf/) & [⌐◧-◧.app](https://github.com/ripe0x/noggles.app)\n\n[![timeline](https://i.postimg.cc/nrGPRm5H/timeline.png)](https://postimg.cc/jnCcCDt9)\n# Progress\nAs a winner of the [Prop House](https://prop.house/nouns/nouns-governance-clients) mandated governance round (Aug ‘22), wiz took Federation from an idea to public infrastructure used by communities in the ecosystem. All code is open source and has been publicly available since the very first commit: [federation repository](https://github.com/nounish/federation/). \n\nMetrics:\n- 40+ Nouns proposal votes cast through Federation contracts\n- 5+ Nouns delegated to Federation contracts\n- Proposal passed for Lil Nouns adoption (which holds 16 Nouns)\n\nCommunities currently on Federation:\n- [Gnars](https://gnars.wtf/) \n- Goop Troop\n\nComing to Federation:\n- [Lil Nouns](https://lilnouns.wtf/)\n- [The Park](https://twitter.com/thepark)\n- [Wizards DAO](https://wizardsdao.com)\n\nDiscussions are currently underway to onboard other communities in the ecosystem that have expressed interest in using Federation such as [SharkDAO](https://sharks.wtf/), [Purple](https://purple.construction/), and [PGodjira](https://twitter.com/pgodjira)\n\n# Future roadmap and outcomes\n[![crossdaomock](https://i.postimg.cc/tgfdbgPF/crossdaomock.png)](https://postimg.cc/v1rxLb0m)\n\nWe believe it’s time to take Federation from a POC to a scalable protocol designed for participating in crossDAO governance and generating value from Nouns ownership.\n\n## Make crossDAO governance easy to understand, simple to do, and commonplace\n- Design & build the new Federation v1 application and website\n- Simplify the process of casting votes as a community\n- Enable support for existing and future Nounish DAOs created via Nouns builder\n- Continue onboarding Noun holding communities to Federation\n- Community voting in Prop House rounds\n- Optimize contracts to reduce storage costs, provide gas refunds, and execution incentives (MEV)\n- Self directed contract deployment and management\n\n## AutoBidder and Ongoing experimention\nWe plan to continuously release experiments that add value to the Nouns ecosystem. One area we are going to explore is an auto-bidder that enables a MEV driven approach to participating in Nouns auctions for communities and individuals.\n- Allows bidding on Nouns auctions automatically\n- Configurable max bid amounts\n- Gas refunds and execution incentives\n\n## Vote bidding\n[![votebidding](https://i.postimg.cc/L85ZspmD/bidonvotes.png)](https://postimg.cc/cvqJDPgt)\n\nExperimentation with crossDAO governance has led to the creation of a [novel vote bidding protocol](https://github.com/nounish/federation/commit/4ab02886abd26d405791fc399db57cc01034cd6b) aimed at giving Nouns holders the ability to monetize their governance rights. Turning the acquisition of a Noun into a revenue generating opportunity for individuals and communities alike.\n\nIn January, we ran an experiment auctioning off a **SINGLE** Noun vote. This led to the following metrics one week after launch:\n- 2 unique bidders\n- 3 votes cast\n- 0.5 ETH value created\n\nThere is a lot more value that can be unlocked with vote bidding and we want to heavily invest in its future development. You can learn more and see it in action by visiting [bids.federation.wtf](http://bids.federation.wtf).\n\n## Community outreach, supportive content and learning material\nIn addition to product development, we will focus on creating content that introduces people to the concepts and benefits of crossDAO governance and vote bidding, and tutorials that show interesting ways that these primitives can be used in the Nouns ecosystem. For example, teaching others how to use Federation with Nouns builder, PartyBid, or showing others how to stand up their own voting blocs (political parties).\n\n# Ask\n**225 ETH** to fund the continued development of [federation.wtf](http://federation.wtf) and its ecosystem for at least 6 months. (There are no plans to stop development after)\n- Engineering and Design (175 ETH)\n- OpEx including infrastructure costs, bounties, artwork, content, marketing (50 ETH)\n\nIf this proposal passes 1/2 of the funds will immediately be released to the team. The remainder will be held in a 3/5 multisig with the following signers:\n\n- [wiz](https://twitter.com/0xWiz_)\n- [ripe](https://twitter.com/ripe0x)\n- [krel](https://twitter.com/krel404)\n- [tmobil](https://twitter.com/TM0B1L)\n- [al409](https://twitter.com/7x7x7eth)\n\n# Previous Funding\n20 ETH awarded for winning the Prop House mandated governance round (Aug ‘22). This was followed by a 12 ETH grant from Lil Nouns.\n\n# Path to Sustainability\nIt is important for us to stay lean while developing Federation. To ensure this is the case, we believe pursuing funding from Nouns is the best option in the short term.\n\nIn the future, we see Federation becoming sustainable through the creation of its own Nouns Builder DAO.\n\n# Relevant Links\nFederation\nweb app: [https://www.federation.wtf/](https://www.federation.wtf/)\nvote bidding experiment: [https://bids.federation.wtf/](https://www.federation.wtf/)\ngithub: [https://github.com/nounish/federation](https://github.com/nounish/federation)\n\nTeam\nwiz: [https://twitter.com/0xWiz_](https://twitter.com/0xWiz_)\nripe: [https://twitter.com/ripe0x](https://twitter.com/ripe0x)\n\n⌐◨-◨","proposer":"0x13eEf4EF8FCa471f242ab0F8F49A3dB6017aDA33","startBlock":16600701,"endBlock":16636701,"executed":true},"votes":[{"support":1,"voter":"0x7D81478Ad18ad375e53De6F74F3122F6be3499ca","numberOfVotes":2,"reason":"the proposed infra offers proper decentralized execution across sub-communities. it is imperative to promote governance and mitigate intermediaries that can be subject to external influence. the ability to engage in trustless governance across subDAOs is the type of innovation i'd like to see Nouns showcase.  i do think there is a chance that trustless participation can increase demand for Nouns, even if by a small margin. ripe and wiz are excellent builders, and i am happy to support this initiative.

About 40 photos taken in 2006 were selected. Each photo has a story. They are portraits of the most varied possible, which will act as guides that will dictate the progress of our itinerary in the village.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/rjrMvLM.jpg)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/2MG7rXs.jpg)\n\n*What would it be like to meet the young Fatou N'Dei, now 20 years old?*\n\n*What stories does she carry with her?*\n\n*What was the village like for her at that time when you played in the rain?*\n\n*What was your father's fate, Badou?*\n\n*Did Fatou N'Dei follow the statistics and become a mother in her youth?*\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/js6EJen.jpg)\n\n\nThe aim of the project is to make an observational documentary, sometimes poetic, sometimes in the photo essay and at other times with backstage coverage, with a making-of behavior camera. A cross between these subgenres will bring harmonic diversity, as the raw material will always be the same: the past of the people and the village. In the footsteps of photographer Daniel Leite will be followed by a small team — which, with the necessary setback, will film these encounters. These same steps will be followed by the past, very closely with pictures the photographer produced in 2006. Whenever necessary, stories and images from the past will gain the screen, either by telling curiosities, or showing, through the contact sheet that will gain the canvas, the photographic step by step until the photo that he judged to be the main one.\n\n[![](https://i.imgur.com/MM1pQio.jpg)](https://vimeo.com/426341855?embedded=true&source=video_title&owner=2297917)\n\n\n.\n\n\n# What we will deliver\n\n1. * **Nouns will sign as the sole sponsor of all works**\n1. * **The logo will appear on a animation card before the movie starts**\n![](https://i.imgur.com/buYkVSY.gif)\n\n1. * A feature film of at least 90 minutes entitled “More past than future”\n\n1. * The logo will be present in all publicity material for the feature.\n![](https://i.imgur.com/o7EPDLq.jpg)\n\n1. * **A short film in a making-off style of at least 20 minutes, showing the entire process of the film, from capturing by Nouns, building our legacy and shooting the film.**\n1. * A 300 page black and white photo book telling what happened in the lives of the characters that will be re-photographed. Before and after portraits and small text extracts that punctuate the transformations of their lives in the span of 17 years.  Note: The book will be sold and all proceeds will revert to the village of Kabadio\n1. * **A Nounish action with the village football team (More details below)**\n1. * Photographic exhibition / Vernissage / Launch of the feature and book in RJ\n1. * **Entry of the feature film and short film on the world circuit of film festivals**\n1. * **All proceeds from the film will go entirely to Kabadio.**\n1. * Professional press office working on the promotion of the film\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/m0jKyqO.jpg)\n\n# The legacy\n![](https://i.imgur.com/zMhlAWP.jpg)\n\n\nThe Casamansa region is a conflagrated region, there is a separatist war there that has lasted more than 30 years. The young people of Kabadio are leaving the village for Europe, through illegal and very dangerous routes. Some manage to finish the path, but they are shocked by the illegality in Europe, others disappear.\n\nThe rural exodus is currently one of the biggest problems in the region and that is why the Permakabadio association works directly with young people in order to avoid choosing this path.\n\nAmong the countless activities offered by Permakabadio, it was in football that they found their greatest strength. Called Asc Bindoula, the association's team was created in order to develop the concept of youth belonging to a much larger context.\n\nMore than 20 athletes work hard throughout the year with the aim of classifying the team in the biggest competition in the state of Casamansa, Intervilarejos, the real World Cup in the region.\n\nTaking place during Senegal's monsoon, one of the most difficult times of the year, where life becomes slow and all locomotion complex. Intervilarejo is a breather and a portal to a new competitive and festive reality.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/LIC6Maz.jpg)\n[Permakabadio's Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/permakabadio)\n\nOur goal is to bring even more strength to the team and its athletes, so we want to sponsor the team next year through the following actions:\n\n* Buy of a new uniform with Nouns as a sponsor\n* Buy of sports equipment for the team (balls, cleats, shin guards…)\n* Workshop with local experts, players, coaches.\n* Renovation of the Kabadio football field\n* Construction of ASC Bindoula's CT (Meeting and Study Room)\n* Library around sports and decolonial themes\n* Buy a laptop for the trainer\n* Buy of a projector to be attached to the laptop for use in viewing games and tactics\n\nAll the amount raised with the release of the first feature was fully transferred to the village in the form of resources or support for projects.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/AvhUsXB.jpg)\n\n\n\nWe facilitated the arrival of energy to the Bindoula permaculture farm, which today has 20 young people working directly in its operation. We helped in the construction of the Community Bakery located on the same farm, we donated half a ton of flour in order to speed up their bakery activities. In addition to donating food to the community and helping with emergencies in the village.\n\nIn this new project it will be no different, all the amount raised will be fully reverted to Kabadio and the maintenance of the legacy that Nouns will leave in the village.\n\n# Why Nouns should fund this proposal\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/K1ZKVE5.jpg)\n\n\n “More past than future” talks about a people, a little visited part of Africa. Giving voice to its population is to bring out our ancestry, as it was from the Senegambia sector (where Kabadio is located) where the first Mandinga enslaved in the Africa x Brazil diasporic movement came from.\n\nThe potential of this project was already proven in our first feature, in which we were present in more than 40 film festivals, passing through 12 countries and remaining in the Amazon Prime Video documentary catalog for 2 years, being watched by more than 300k people worldwide.\n\nOur bonds are not frivolous, our relationships are not ephemeral. We have followed the life of this village for more than 15 years and we intend to participate more and more in its development.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/1qJC2Tf.jpg)\n\n\nSponsoring our documentary and book gives Nouns the opportunity to take their glasses into the most prestigious film festivals in the world, project their brand into the streaming universe, participate in an arts publication of historical importance and thereby affirm even more the strength of the community and its ability to be involved in big projects.\n\nIn addition to the public understanding the importance of Nouns in carrying out these artistic projects, they will understand that it was the initial vector for a legacy that belongs to the village. The films and the book make up an archive that will be entirely dedicated to the village's causes until the end of time.\n\nOur cinema is humanitarian, all resources captured in this proposal will be donated to the village of Kabadio, located in the south of Senegal in the region of Casamance.

Upon execution, the mint and film will both be available here: [premiere.wtf](http://premiere.wtf/)\n\n_______________\n\nThe Wizards Hat has been a labor of love from its genesis to completion. Every aspect of the film from early pre-production art through to voice overs, sound design and animation has been toiled over, aiming to uphold a long-established artisan approach of traditional animation. The team has enjoyed every little step of the journey and we hope watching it is as magical as it has been making it.\n\nWe ended up writing a long form breakdown of Harriett - a bubbly wizard’s hat who always sees the cauldron half-full, and Grummelot - a grumpy old spellmaster stuck in his ways. An origin story and full season arcs are ready to be turned into a full animated series if the opportunity arises.\n\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/FY8CnDF.jpg)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/KeV1Mnq.jpg)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/gfer8kq.jpg)\n\n______________\n\n[Prop 190](https://nouns.wtf/vote/190) described an idea, that \"by minting... from the DAO via a proposal, it is becoming Nouns DAO canon. Similar to how the DAO added in new head attributes via a proposal, Nouns can continue to explore and experiment with new models of CC0 art and production and minting directly from the DAO is a new tool for the organization to directly release and distribute the most important artifacts from the community. It’s not hard to see how this can advance Nouns into a crypto-native form of Movie Studio, Production House, Art Museum and so on.\"\n\nThe film will be released as a timed open edition for a price of 0.05 ETH. This means it will be available for anyone to mint for the premiere week, which will be approximately the 20th Feb - 27th Feb, (beginning from proposal execution). Proceeds from sale will be split between Nouns DAO and the Wizards Hat production team 50/50.\n\nAgain, we echo the sentiment of [prop 190](https://nouns.wtf/vote/190): \"We are excited to experiment with DAO NFT releases as an additional value capture mechanism, and potentially create a simple and repeatable model for any creator, community and brand in the ecosystem to put forward amazing artifacts to be minted via Nouns.\"\n\nThis edition will be minted with [Zora](https://zora.co/), and will be available to mint onchain as well as watch the film at [premiere.wtf](http://premiere.wtf/) after the proposal is executed.\n\nFind out more about what we've been up to here: [twitter.com/nouns_stories](https://twitter.com/nouns_stories)\n\nNote: the Zora edition has been setup with the film's trailer as a placeholder, and will be swapped out to the final film upon execution, before transferring the contract ownership to the DAO.\n\n--------\n\n**Release Details:**\nTitle: The Wizard's Hat\n\n**Description:**\nThe Wizards Hat will be the first ever film premiere and second ever edition mint executed by Nouns DAO, created by Nouns Stories + Pixel.\n\n**Symbol:**\nNOUNSSTORIES0001\n\n**Edition Type:**\nTimed Open Edition\n\n**Start date (approx):**\nFeb 20th (12 days after proposal submitted)\n\n**End date:** \nFeb 27th (7 days after execution)\n\n**Price:**\n0.05 ETH\n\n**Split address:**\n0x77104f74F4fbDCf62b5bcB3D08cd12774f6e9998\n\n**Wizard Hat team address (Pixel):**\n0x5184782cC00E90D2E0C82A8f22729f7f38a572B8\n\n**Nouns DAO Treasury Address:**\n0x0BC3807Ec262cB779b38D65b38158acC3bfedE10\n\n**Note:**\ngoldy.eth (The Wizard Hat producer) is set as collection defaultAdmin to update any potentially issues with metadata + salesConfig upon contract deploy and will then transfer ownership to Nouns DAO Treasury Address when finalized.\n\n⌐◨-◨","proposer":"0x021edd67d43B365a6401a5Ee704Aa6f264F3F4e4","startBlock":16622280,"endBlock":16658280,"executed":true},"votes":[{"support":1,"voter":"0x41E72D30C967A595cC2c7dBc9e1Ed98638f3b8c8","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0xaE65E700f3f8904ac1007d47a5309dD26f8146c0","numberOfVotes":0,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0xF2E7Fd6C7AC39165a428245F15DA6487Ce04270a","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0xA86882277E69FbF0a51805cdc8b0a3a113079E63","numberOfVotes":2,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0xa903C06BF35286f6d1cDAD25396748353979a44C","numberOfVotes":2,"reason":"⌐◨-◨ "},{"support":1,"voter":"0xCF4e26a7e7eAe4b3840dd31C527096e1265AB990","numberOfVotes":2,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x7D81478Ad18ad375e53De6F74F3122F6be3499ca","numberOfVotes":2,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x1D3077F87EE7b08217E22f65FBe014ed06E51ddf","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":"will def mint"},{"support":1,"voter":"0x1e66a3D0a6A327b1F29e8ACf3a3d9E1E4E088683","numberOfVotes":2,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x86030dbbCe1c771Ff6622C20455cd3619aa93c05","numberOfVotes":46,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0xba2b9804FbffA8F1A8F7DC8dd600E21268beF09F","numberOfVotes":3,"reason":"we need more of this!

Finish development, testing and deploy a generalized NFT random distributor which enables any proposer to propose distribution of current or future NFTs in our Treasury. The distributor makes use of new tech I call “functional props”; meaning the prop itself determines how many NFTs to distribute at execution time as a function of the prop’s vote counts.\n2. Develop, test, audit and deploy a contract that enables proposers to ask for functional funding. Functional funding allows proposers to suggest a funding range within which they are willing to execute a prop. The actual funding amount received is determined by the prop’s vote counts.\n\n# Why Functional Props?\n\n*Cool tech, cool experiment. But how is it useful?*\n\nFor both NFT distribution and funding it’s a more efficient way of achieving “middle ground”; a form of consensus.\n\nThink about it as a way of taking an on-chain average of all opinions.\n\nThe current alternative is an attention-deprived off-chain back and forth between proponent and community to arrive at a proposal price point or distribution number.\n\nThis [back and forth I had with Gami](https://twitter.com/0xDigitalOil/status/1622308820658651139) goes deeper. An extract:\n\n### What stops people from just setting the lower threshold to their ideal amount and upper threshold as buffer?\n\nIf you set the lower threshold to ideal amount you increase the risk of the prop not passing vs a vanilla prop ceteris paribus.\n\n### As for the thresholds, how would voters know that proposer set their levels in such a way?\n\nVoters will know the range of funding. When voting, you know that if there is intense support, the prop will hit the upper part of the range. If it barely passes, it will hit the lower part.\n\nYou base your vote on that.\n\nIf you feel comfortable with the funding range, you vote FOR. The more people feel comfortable with the range, the higher the funding.\n\nIt gives quadratic funding vibes.\n\n### When put like that it feels like it would alleviate some of the anxiety around voting too. Like sharing the load in a clever way. Nice.\n\nRight. Well put. Like smoothing out the noise in a signal with a moving average filter.\n\n# Phase 1: Generalized NFT Distributor\n\nBefore functional funding comes functional NFT distribution.\n\nI am the dev and proposer behind [Prop 199](https://nouns.wtf/vote/199) which passed 226 : 9. Prop 199 was a successful experiment to distribute 50 Nouns Vision Glasses from our Treasury to Nouners at random.\n\nI have developed (inspect code [here](https://github.com/0xDigitalOil/nouns-props/tree/master/GeneralizedNFTDistributor)) a generalized version of the Nouns Vision Glasses distributor that allows for any proposer to propose random distribution of any ERC-721 in our Treasury to Nouners. This included development of a generalized version of the BatchTransfer contract [9999.⌐◨-◨](https://twitter.com/lastpunk9999) deployed for [Prop 185](https://nouns.wtf/vote/185).\n\nAs this deployment is not a one-off and meant to be a primitive the DAO can leverage at any time, plus the code is more complex, it requires more extensive testing. In addition, it requires a more complex custom front-end for the distribution claims.\n\n## Functional Distribution\n\nThe generalized NFT distributor has a new distribution mechanism baked in that allows the proposer to set the maximum number of NFTs to distribute. Then, if the prop passes, at execution time, the distribution contract calculates the number of NFTs to randomly distribute as a function of the vote (for, against, abstain) counts.\n\nThe proposer also selects the distribution amount calculation mechanism. This code extract shows the possible distribution rules the proposer can select from:\n\n![Proposer can select among the following distribution rules: Total turnout per Noun, Total Turnout minus abstain per Noun, For Votes, For Votes per Noun, For minus Against Votes, For minus Against Votes per Noun.](https://i.ibb.co/Gthy2Nj/Untitled.png)\n\nProposer can select among the following distribution rules: Total turnout per Noun, Total Turnout minus abstain per Noun, For Votes, For Votes per Noun, For minus Against Votes, For minus Against Votes per Noun.\n\nFor example, the proposer might want to propose a distribution of some LilNouns in the treasury. The proposer is unsure of how many LilNouns the DAO is willing to distribute so he/she selects VotesFor as the distribution mechanism. Thus, the higher “For Vote” turnout (the more popular the prop was), the more LilNouns will be distributed. \n\n## Prop Execution\n\nHere’s how proposing and execution works:\n\n![Untitled](https://i.ibb.co/nn33yHB/Untitled-1.png)\n\n# Phase 2: Functional Funding\n\nI call “functional props” proposals that are self-referential at prop execution time. Initially I’m interested in exploring props that use vote counts (i.e., how many for/against/abstain) as inputs and take actions as a function of those inputs. We could imagine going beyond that to enable props that pull from a larger voter input-space such as vote reasons*.\n\nFunctional funding is a subset of functional props that enables an efficient way for the DAO to price proposals. The mechanism works as follows:\n\n1. Proposer writes a prop where he/she proposes to do some work for Nouns DAO.\n2. The proposer sets the prop transaction to call the FunctionalFunding contract and selects a funding range (e.g. 30-50 ETH) and distribution rule. This signals to the DAO that he/she is willing to do the work for a minimum of 30 ETH, but if the DAO as a whole signals that it values the work being done greatly (via strong FOR support), the proposer will get funded more than 30 ETH, up to 50 ETH.\n3. If the prop passes, when it executes it references itself, reading its vote counts to determine the funding amount according to the distribution rule.\n4. FunctionalFunding contract sends the calculated amount of ETH.\n\n![Untitled](https://i.ibb.co/bgPmDV1/Untitled-2.png)\n\n## What does this solve?\n\nFor Proposers:\n\n- Allows the proposer to do an all-in-one price discovery by “polling” all voters on-chain\n- Lower probability of good proposals being rejected due to mere price → avoids going back, adjusting price and resubmitting\n\nFor Voters:\n\n- Decision is less stressful as it’s less binary. You can be OK with the prop content and range and “delegate” price decision to the rest of the voters\n\nFor Nouns DAO:\n\n- All-in-one prop voting and efficient price discovery\n- Proposals are more likely to be funded closer to “fair price” than the current binary funding mechanism\n\n# Deliverables\n\n1. Trustless, immutable primitive contract-set that allow Nouners to propose random distribution of NFTs, where the final number of NFTs distributed is a function of proposal popularity.\n2. Front-end for claiming NFTs of said distribution rounds. Allows for multiple distribution rounds per NFT collection.\n3. Trustless, immutable primitive contract that allow Nouners to create proposals that are funded within a range as a function of proposal popularity.\n\n# Ask\n\n35 ETH sent to me, [DigitalOil](https://twitter.com/0xDigitalOil). \n\nIf only I could propose a functional funding range 🤷‍♂️.\n\n### Funding breakdown\n\n1. 15 ETH — finish testing of NFT Distributor contracts. Develop generalized claim front-end.\n2. 20 ETH — Develop functional funding contract, including contract audit.\n\n*Note that using vote reasons as inputs to functional props would require a change to the governance contract as vote reasons are currently not introspectable at execution time.","proposer":"0xAEC4075e4fc8cE829BC4f0cFD5e2fA10dd2b12D1","startBlock":16650922,"endBlock":16686922,"executed":false},"votes":[{"support":1,"voter":"0xb4496906D6EA2685E7A46A14BAEfae9fe3bF0D2f","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0xa903C06BF35286f6d1cDAD25396748353979a44C","numberOfVotes":2,"reason":"The range funding is the killer app here imo.

The chain is steadily growing, but at the time of writing, the Ethereum chain is around 500GB - 1TB (depending on the client), and every node on the network needs to be able to store all of the data. If the chain were to expand to large amounts of data (say 5TBs) it wouldn't be feasible for all nodes to continue to run.

By using Ceramic, the Nounish platform is able to provide faster data retrieval and processing, as well as advanced data management tools such as decentralized identifiers (DIDs) that enable greater control and ownership over data. \n\n- **Who are the team members?** **Baba**: 1 of 5 Nouns DAO Governance Prop House Mandate Winners, Datapod Co-Lead for Lil Nouns, Lil Nouns grants committee multi-sig signer. **Al409**: 2x Lil Noun DAO resident, and Agora Nouner Delegate Winner.  **Ripe, Volky**: Prop House Winners and BuilderDAO contributors. **Brunes, Champion Score**: Ex-Stripe, Ex-Google, and Nouns Governance Prop House Mandate Winners.\n\n## Problem Statement\nAs the DAO grows, people must navigate an environment that is increasingly fragmented. The data produced by many small and large applications are scattered, siloed and inconsistent in format and structure, making it difficult for users to access and utilize. This fragmentation lowers the accessibility, usability, and value of the data, and limits the potential insights and innovations that can be gained from it.\n\n  \n\nIn addition, only a small subset of all data in the Nouniverse is stored on-chain, which can create challenges for developers and users who need to access and use this data. In a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), data is a critical asset that drives decision-making, governance, and value creation. Therefore, it is important for a DAO to have a decentralized data network like Ceramic that provides users with greater control and ownership of their data, and enables interoperability and composability of data across different applications, including off-chain data.\n\n  \n**Vision**: In a future wherein permissionless data collaboration achieves critical mass within the DAO, users would have unprecedented control and ownership over their data, with the ability to easily share and reuse it across different participating applications. The decentralized nature of Ceramic would ensure that data is stored securely and efficiently, without the risk of censorship or centralization. The interoperability and composability enabled by Ceramic would lead to a proliferation of innovative and user-centric applications, breaking down the barriers that currently exist between different platforms and ecosystems. The benefits of this future would extend beyond just the technical members of the DAO, as all users would be able to take advantage of the seamless and intuitive interfaces enabled by the data network. The adoption of Ceramic would be a major step towards a more open and equitable internet, where data is treated as a commons to be shared and nurtured, rather than a commodity to be monetized and controlled.\n\n![Qm-Vda-PMMMe-Sj1-J6-RSeuizx-N1u-Bq-LAPc-N1f-G9phu-Uuv-Bk-Wb.png](https://i.postimg.cc/KzWKZNzt/Qm-Vda-PMMMe-Sj1-J6-RSeuizx-N1u-Bq-LAPc-N1f-G9phu-Uuv-Bk-Wb.png)\n\n## Objectives\n-   To create a decentralized data network and database that can make it easier for people to access, understand and use data in the Nouniverse.\n-   To give people more control and ownership over their data through the use of decentralized identifiers (DIDs).\n-   To make it possible for different applications to share and use data, creating new possibilities for how data can be used.\n-   To provide developers with access to a permissionless data layer, which includes information on governance, funding, and user activity for the DAO.\n-   To make it easy for developers to integrate with and build on top of the data that the DAO has collected.\n-   To enable developers to tap into the network effects of the DAO by allowing their applications to connect and interact with each other.\n-   To enable a more open and equitable internet where data is treated as a shared resource rather than a commodity that can be controlled and monetized.\n\n## Deliverables - 3 Month Timeline\nTo achieve these objectives, we will deliver the following components: infrastructure, applications, and services.\n\n**Infrastructure**: The infrastructure component involves deploying a Ceramic network node that runs an instance of ComposeDB, a decentralized, composable graph database. This node will serve the applications, which can read and write data permissionlessly (subject to data ownership constraints). The raw data backing this database is stored in IPFS. In order to bootstrap application use cases, relevant on-chain and off-chain data will be imported, processed and stored into ComposeDB. The data will be attributed with relationships for composability and made available via a GraphQL API.\n\n**Applications**: Three applications will be deployed on the Ceramic network by the core team upon completion.\n\n-   **NounsID** - The identity interface for the Nouniverse. A user profile for participants of the Nouns ecosystem, composed of user-owned properties and relationships to data from sources such as on-chain proposals and votes, PropHouse, Snapshot and Discourse. The user-owned profile allows the user to control their represented identity, linking it to social media accounts, setting up their preferences and carrying them across application built atop the decentralized data layer.\n    \n-   **Builder Profile** - Builder profiles (nounish cv) are meant to give a full picture of a nounish builder's contributions to the Nouniverse, leveraging data aggregated from NounID, stored on the decentralized data layer.\n    \n-   **Noundry** - Will integrate with the Ceramic network, leveraging its decentralized datastore, and our universal identity (NounsID). Noundry Ceramic Integration may include but are not limited by the following features:\n    \n    -  Upload your traits once, use it all across the ecosystem! - Create your artist profile and keep your own provenance records - Include metadata with your artwork. Give it name & context.\n    - Remix & collab on everything, powered by CC0 Some ideas of integrations to harness this data: \n    - Noundry contests, to sign up your traits and try to make them into official Nouns traits. \n    - Builder DAO, to boot a new DAO with Nounish artwork using a collection of existing traits. \n    - Noun DAO UIs, to show tooltips over the Nouns with more info about the traits and their artists\n    - Other features to explore: cross-dao artwork compatibility by mapping out trait categories, templates, sizes & color palettes - Scraping of existing artwork and contacting artists to seed their profiles - Offering the artwork in multiple formats (svg, png) for better compatibility with different applications\n\n\n**Services**: \n- Throughout development, the team will provide weekly Q&A during office hours, hosted by The Noun Square. \n- The team will provide a JavaScript library that makes it easy for front-end applications to query and deploy their own data. \n- Finally, we will collaborate with AI Pod, providing the processed and formatted data relevant for training their models.\n\n## Deliverables:\n**Infrastructure Component:**\n-   **Nounish decentralized database**: We'll run a Ceramic and ComposeDB node that serves the data through a GraphQL API.\n- **Scrape/ingest real Nouns data sources**: Collect PropHouse, on-chain, Snapshot and Discourse data in near real-time, so that apps can query and compose them through our service.\n- **Client library for easy integration**: Provide a JavaScript library that client applications can use to easily query and publish data.\n- **Nouner preferences:** Deploy a Preferred proposal categories, optional social links, preferred Noun profile image and other .\n- **Support and/or integrate with partners and application developers**: Work with the community to brainstorm on new and existing models and incorporate feedback.\n    \n>**Note**: Part of this work has been started with 15k USD subsidized by the Ceramic builder grants.\n\n\n**Application Component:**\n-   **1st Party, Core Applications:** NounsID\n- **3rd Party, Nounish Partner Integrations:** Noundry Integration and Builder Profile\n\n**Services Component:**\n-   Provide ingested, and formatted data for AI Pod\n-   Provide developers with APIs and a library to leverage permissionless, composable databases as a service.\n-   Q&A with developers during regularly scheduled office hours on The Noun Square.\n\n## Success Criteria\n\n-   **Uptime**: Functional network with availability on-par with centralized databases.\n-   **Integrations**: Successful integration with launch partner - Noundry.\n-  **Composability**: One or more demonstrable (ideally novel) composable and interoperable application use cases from pre-existing applications in the Nouns ecosystem.\n-   **Partnerships**: Number of pre-existing nounish applications that commit, and follow through with network integrations in the ecosystem that leverage the network.\n- **Data Sources**: Amount of data sources integrated, and CRUD operations executed on Ceramic.\n\n## Future Work\n\n-   Expand data sources to eventually include all relevant data generated in the Nouniverse and make it permissionless and composable, along with publishing relevant metadata from applications running on the network.\n-   Create developer tools, documentation, and examples to make development easier for developers.\n-   Partnerships: Coordinate with Voters.wtf, Federation, Lil Nouns mainsite, and Apache SuperSet(Nouns Metrics), for potential network integration.\n\n## Team Structure & Budget\n\n- **Infrastructure, NounsID development:** \n    - Brunes: 7.75 ETH/Month\n    - Champion Score: 7.5 ETH/Month\n- **Technical Program & Partnership Management:** \n    -  Al409: 3 ETH/Month\n    -  Baba: 7 ETH/Month \n- **Integration Partners:** \n    - Volky: 3 ETH/Month\n    - Ripe: 3 ETH/Month\n- **Builder Grants**: ETH allocation to be used for Prop House rounds, and/or direct developer/builder integrations with Ceramic in order to bootstrap the network effects of our Nounish dataverse. Builder funds that are not used will be returned to NounsDAO treasury. \n    - 7.5 ETH/Month\n\n\n\n\n\n**Amount/Time**: 39 ETH/Month\n**Duration**: 3 months\n**Total**: 117 ETH","proposer":"0xDCb4117e3A00632efCaC3C169E0B23959f555E5e","startBlock":16722423,"endBlock":16758423,"executed":false},"votes":[{"support":1,"voter":"0xAEC4075e4fc8cE829BC4f0cFD5e2fA10dd2b12D1","numberOfVotes":2,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x7f64C6e6908DE72221A06A06b4a02A6546a4d6d2","numberOfVotes":2,"reason":""},{"support":0,"voter":"0x538C4F2AfA012911851dAdf0655cb61377e7a8EB","numberOfVotes":2,"reason":"I think this is interesting and there's a need for a central API for nounish builders to use.

Finish development, testing and deploy a generalized NFT random distributor which enables any proposer to propose distribution of current or future NFTs in our Treasury. The distributor makes use of new tech I call “functional props”; meaning the prop itself determines how many NFTs to distribute at execution time as a function of the prop’s vote counts. `Now includes a Pull Request into the nouns.wtf front-end to allow for a better UX when proposing NFT distributions.`\n3. Develop, test, audit and deploy a contract that enables proposers to ask for functional funding. Functional funding allows proposers to suggest a funding range within which they are willing to execute a prop. The actual funding amount received is determined by the prop’s vote counts. `Now includes a Pull Request into the nouns.wtf front-end to allow for better UX when proposing range or milestone funding.`\n\n# Why Functional Props?\n\n*Cool tech, cool experiment. But how is it useful?*\n\n`Historically, all DAO proposals have had binary outcomes (pass or fail). The time has come to invent tooling for DAOs to allow for non-binary outcomes on votes, and for Nouns to lead the way on this.`\n\n`Take Prop 239 (comic book purchase) as an example. The DAO could be in agreement that it makes sense to purchase comic books, but not necessarily 5,000 of them. If the prop’s voting outcome were non-binary, the DAO would have had a way to simultaneously decide if it makes sense, and also how many comic books to print. Maybe the prop wouldn’t have had to be canceled.`\n\nFor both NFT distribution and funding it’s a more efficient way of achieving “middle ground”; a form of consensus.\n\nThink about it as a way of taking an on-chain average of all opinions.\n\nThe current alternative is an attention-deprived off-chain back and forth between proponent and community to arrive at a proposal price point or distribution number.\n\n# `Past props where functional props would have been useful`\n\n`Prop 236: Wizard’s Hat — determine the mint price of our NFT together at vote time, from a range.`\n\n`Prop 223: House of Nouns — Implement milestones instead of all or nothing.  Milestones are mapped to voting tiers. The more popular the prop is at vote time, more funding is sent and more features get implemented.`\n\n`Prop 217: Stake an additional 5,000 ETH in LIDO — instead stake between 1,000-5,000 depending on the level of support for the prop.`\n\n`Prop 206: Nouns on the Ground 2023 — Do tiered funding (5, 10, or 15 IRL events) instead of all or nothing.`\n\n`Prop 202: nouns.eth set reverse record — in addition to executing, do we also send 1 ETH to Jacob? Depending on the popularity of the prop, we send between 0-1ETH.`\n\n`Prop 184: Nouns funding ZachXBT — fund within range 50-100 ETH, instead of all or nothing.`\n\n`Prop 167: Nouns Builder — seed the Builder treasury within a range (e.g. 500-1,000 ETH).`\n\n`Prop 125: 8/8 anniversary art — only change existing traits if the vote is unanimous.*`\n\n# `Answers to common doubts on functional funding`\n\n### `What if a proposer that is willing to do work for 30 ETH proposes a range of 30-50 ETH to squeeze out more from the DAO?`\n\n`A proposer is disincentivized to do so, as it increases the likelihood of the prop being defeated. It could also be argued conversely, that if functional funding wasn’t possible, the proposer could have proposed an all-or-nothing 50 ETH instead of a range where the DAO could save money if the prop passes, but barely. We can’t be certain if functional funding will make overall payouts larger or smaller, but we can be sure that funds will be allocated more efficiently as more granularity allows for concentrating capital where it needs to be.`\n\n### `If I support a proposal getting the lower part of the range, but not the upper part, how am I supposed to decide how to vote before the very last second?`\n\n`Granted that this is a tricky aspect of functional funding. I give a two-part answer:`\n\n`1. The question doesn’t apply to all props where functional funding could be useful. For example, take the hypothetical use for Prop 217 (staking in LIDO). If you are OK with staking 5,000 ETH, you are OK with staking 1,000. In this case, you it doesn’t really matter to you if you vote early or later. If you aren’t comfortable with staking up to 5,000 ETH, you vote against. You would have voted against Prop 217 in its non-functional funding incarnation anyway.`\n`2. Granted that those who vote later have more information than those who vote earlier. However, those that vote earlier likely are OK with the entire range. Those that vote later will have more influence over the outcome. This is a net positive: a. those who are OK with the entire range are happy. b. those who want to control the range, can do so by voting later.`\n\n### `Even though the tech is innovative, I don’t see it being widely adopted`\n\n`Refer to the section above where I highlight some use cases that make Nouns a more agile decision-making DAO.`\n\n### `The main mechanics of the DAO should stick to the KISS principle`\n\n`The concern is that it should be made as simple as possible for Nouners to vote. I agree that simpler is better. Most props will not make use of functional funding and will stick to KISS. However, for those that it makes sense to make outcomes functional, if it’s more efficient for the DAO, it’s worth the marginal complexity.`\n\n# Phase 1: Generalized NFT Distributor\n\nBefore functional funding comes functional NFT distribution.\n\nI am the dev and proposer behind [Prop 199](https://nouns.wtf/vote/199) which passed 226 : 9. Prop 199 was a successful experiment to distribute 50 Nouns Vision Glasses from our Treasury to Nouners at random.\n\nI have developed (inspect code [here](https://github.com/0xDigitalOil/nouns-props/tree/master/GeneralizedNFTDistributor)) a generalized version of the Nouns Vision Glasses distributor that allows for any proposer to propose random distribution of any ERC-721 in our Treasury to Nouners. This included development of a generalized version of the BatchTransfer contract [9999.⌐◨-◨](https://twitter.com/lastpunk9999) deployed for [Prop 185](https://nouns.wtf/vote/185).\n\nAs this deployment is not a one-off and meant to be a primitive the DAO can leverage at any time, plus the code is more complex, it requires more extensive testing. In addition, it requires a more complex custom front-end for the distribution claims.\n\n## `Why do we need a generalized NFT distributor?`\n\n`The Nouns DAO treasury continues to hoard NFTs as subDAOs such as Lil Nouns and Nouns Builder are “paying backwards” in the form of governance tokens.`\n\n`It is likely that as the Nouns meme proliferates, more and more subDAOs will continue to do the same.`\n\n`Historically, we haven’t used these NFTs to govern these subDAOs and to this date haven’t reached consensus as to whether it’s something we are interested in doing as a DAO.`\n\n`There is no point in having NFTs in our treasury that we don’t plan on using. If we are to go down the alternate path, who better than Nouners to receive them and participate in subDAO governance in an individual, more decentralized manner.`\n\n## Functional Distribution\n\nThe generalized NFT distributor has a new distribution mechanism baked in that allows the proposer to set the maximum number of NFTs to distribute. Then, if the prop passes, at execution time, the distribution contract calculates the number of NFTs to randomly distribute as a function of the vote (for, against, abstain) counts.\n\nThe proposer also selects the distribution amount calculation mechanism. This code extract shows the possible distribution rules the proposer can select from:\n\n![Proposer can select among the following distribution rules: Total turnout per Noun, Total Turnout minus abstain per Noun, For Votes, For Votes per Noun, For minus Against Votes, For minus Against Votes per Noun.](https://i.ibb.co/Gthy2Nj/Untitled.png)\n\nProposer can select among the following distribution rules: Total turnout per Noun, Total Turnout minus abstain per Noun, For Votes, For Votes per Noun, For minus Against Votes, For minus Against Votes per Noun.\n\nFor example, the proposer might want to propose a distribution of some LilNouns in the treasury. The proposer is unsure of how many LilNouns the DAO is willing to distribute so he/she selects VotesFor as the distribution mechanism. Thus, the higher “For Vote” turnout (the more popular the prop was), the more LilNouns will be distributed. \n\n## Prop Execution\n\nHere’s how proposing and execution works:\n\n![Untitled](https://i.ibb.co/nn33yHB/Untitled-1.png)\n\n# Phase 2: Functional Funding\n\nI call “functional props” proposals that are self-referential at prop execution time. Initially I’m interested in exploring props that use vote counts (i.e., how many for/against/abstain) as inputs and take actions as a function of those inputs. We could imagine going beyond that to enable props that pull from a larger voter input-space such as vote reasons*.\n\nFunctional funding is a subset of functional props that enables an efficient way for the DAO to price proposals. The mechanism works as follows:\n\n1. Proposer writes a prop where he/she proposes to do some work for Nouns DAO.\n2. The proposer sets the prop transaction to call the FunctionalFunding contract and selects a funding range (e.g. 30-50 ETH) and distribution rule. This signals to the DAO that he/she is willing to do the work for a minimum of 30 ETH, but if the DAO as a whole signals that it values the work being done greatly (via strong FOR support), the proposer will get funded more than 30 ETH, up to 50 ETH.\n3. If the prop passes, when it executes it references itself, reading its vote counts to determine the funding amount according to the distribution rule.\n4. FunctionalFunding contract sends the calculated amount of ETH.\n\n![Untitled](https://i.ibb.co/bgPmDV1/Untitled-2.png)\n\n## What does this solve?\n\nFor Proposers:\n\n- Allows the proposer to do an all-in-one price discovery by “polling” all voters on-chain\n- Lower probability of good proposals being rejected due to mere price → avoids going back, adjusting price and resubmitting\n\nFor Voters:\n\n- Decision is less stressful as it’s less binary. You can be OK with the prop content and range and “delegate” decision of the price point to the rest of the voters\n\nFor Nouns DAO:\n\n- All-in-one prop voting and efficient price discovery\n- Proposals are more likely to be funded closer to “fair price” than the current binary funding mechanism\n- `For the first time, allows the DAO to vote on proposals that need to pass unanimously to execute`\n\n# Deliverables\n\n1. Trustless, immutable primitive contract-set that allow Nouners to propose random distribution of NFTs, where the final number of NFTs distributed is a function of proposal popularity.\n2. Front-end for claiming NFTs of said distribution rounds. Allows for multiple distribution rounds per NFT collection.\n3. Trustless, immutable primitive contract that allow Nouners to create proposals that are funded within a range as a function of proposal popularity.\n4. `UI on [nouns.wtf](http://nouns.wtf) similar to the USDC converter, that allows proposers to select and input parameters for functional NFT distributions or funding.`\n\n# `Positive feedback on Prop 238`\n\n**`The innovative approach to Human Organization presented here is a promising addition to the Nouns toolkit, which continues to lead the way with innovative public goods. I support the continued exploration of fresh governance approaches, such as the \"Function Props\" concept, which can leverage the benefits of large group decision-making.`**\n\n**`I'm in favor of experimenting to find better mechanisms we can use to reach non-binary outcomes for proposals and for that reason I'm voting in favor. Even if this isn't used much or is used and we discover what the shortcoming is, that would be a plus in my book.`**\n\n**`I think that it is important for the DAO to continue to explore new ways to use governance to resolve conflict, and I see \"Function Props\" as a promising direction here. They could offer a way to take advantage of the concave decision making advantage of large groups: where any point along the spectrum from 0 to 1 is higher value than either a 0 or 1 outcome.`**\n\n**`innovative price discovery`**\n\n**`Great way to put the NFTs in the treasury to work!`**\n\n**`Sounds like this can be implemented, so I'm in full support.

In this world, we would have no need for rules or principles. But in our world, voting is a reality. So we have a simple rule: we only vote against. We use a “Squad Vote” for each proposal. If more people vote against than vote for or abstain, we vote against on-chain. Otherwise, we abstain. This is our rule.\n\nAccording to the “squad vote” result for proposal 241, which is 33 for, 8 against and 15 abstain, we choose to vote abstain.\n\nThe House Of Nouns proposal is one that is difficult to find flaws in.\n\nWe have two concerns:\n\n1. NounsDAO has no ownership of the product that the proposal promises. Will the ownership of the product, as promised in the proposal, be allocated to NounsDAO? If there is no correlation, then the funds requested in the proposal are essentially for the team to develop a product that belongs solely to themselves using NounsDAO's funds. This is a proposal that harms Nouns and benefits the team.\n\n2. Complexity of features. The product promises to implement a complete governance lifecycle, including collecting ideas, early-stage discussions, on-chain decisions, etc. This means that the functional requirements are complex, and once the complexity is identified, even the best product manager will find it difficult to handle.\n\nFirst concern is not an issue with the 242 proposal, but rather with the immaturity of the NounsDAO system itself.\n\nOverall, we like the House Of Nouns product and team for the following reasons:\n\n1. We are frequent users of House Of Nouns. It is simple and has redesigned the user interaction logic to focus on proposals, rather than channels, communities, or governance participants. This is a new type of product, and it has been well received by users (we can attest to that).\n\n2. House Of Nouns is the first governance tool to define a complete governance process, implying a standard for proposal governance. It is beneficial not only for NounsDAO but also for the Nounish and Crypto industry, as it promotes scientific and standardized governance.\n\n3. House Of Nouns has an excellent product team behind it. They understand the Nouns spirit and have developed a new Nouns model product called thatsgnarly.ly. Behind House Of Nouns and ThatsGnarly's products, one can see a professional and continuous product development system, which is invaluable."},{"support":2,"voter":"0xeffec2D0163343c8F26983Af1f6684e0b966a6b2","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0xeb13fdDFA9B2A4a6E4e7B2D67b6E38C208C41249","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x19Cc9d48f2032f3EC8d6f60EA84979169A848231","numberOfVotes":2,"reason":""},{"support":0,"voter":"0xBd7Dbab9AEb52D6c8d0E80fCeBdE3af4CC86204A","numberOfVotes":6,"reason":""}]},{"prop":{"id":243,"description":"# Prop Lot: Where Ideas find People\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/qJk3uZ4.png)\n\n### **What**\n\nThis is a proposal to build an ideas marketplace for Nouns.\n\n### **Goals**\n\n1. make it easier for ideas and builders to be considered by the DAO.\n2. make it easier for Nouners to signal what they want to see done and funded.\n\n### **How**\n\nThe marketplace will separate ideas from proposals.

This is our rule.\n\nAccording to the “squad vote” result for proposal 241, which is 19 for, 13 against and 12 abstain, we choose to vote abstain.\n\nWe support Proposal 244.\n\n1. The Lilnouns community has adopted it, with over 160 ideas collected and turned into proposals through a proven process. \n\n2.

PropLot's effectiveness in NounsDAO is in doubt. PropLot performs well in the Lilnouns community due to its member size and its integration into the lilnouns website. \nBut PropLot and NounsDAO are very different. NounsDAO is a network with only 341 holders (NounsDAO is not a community), while Lilnouns has a community of 2338 active members who generate many interesting stories on Discord. \nIn addition, if PropLot is not integrated into the NounsDAO website or the processes of Prop House or House Of Nouns, then there will be little interaction with holders and users. Although Nouns.Center has implemented this feature, its entry point is too deep, and no one uses it. These are the reasons why we do not believe PropLot will be successfully adopted in NounsDAO.\n\n2. There are also many alternative products available. PropLot's idea is simple and can easily be implemented by HouseOfNouns (in their proposal) or other products such as nouns.build and nounsagora.\n\nOverall, we are willing to believe in them and take this adventure together!"},{"support":1,"voter":"0x19Cc9d48f2032f3EC8d6f60EA84979169A848231","numberOfVotes":2,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x5fC3aFaeeF0fF1149cee3bd80C1B20DE629dF880","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""}]},{"prop":{"id":245,"description":"# Nouns: A Movie\n\n# Nouns : A Movie\n*Fund it as we build it. ⌐◨-◨*\n\n### Tl;dr:\nAfter the success of [Prop 195](https://nouns.wtf/vote/195) and the release of the [Nountown animated short film](https://twitter.com/AtriumNft/status/1622726466948694018) we made, we are proposing Nouns engage with Atrium to continually produce a series of episodic content via consecutive proposals. When this content is pieced together retroactively - all of the cinematic content will be able to be binged as a single movie / series. Atrium creatives will write and create the content which will be split up among story acts.\n\nThis specific prop is funding a pilot delivered at the end of 90 days. Detailed below are the steps involved in exploring different visual styles, additional deliverables and ultimately making the Pilot content. \n\nAfter the pilot is revealed in 90 days, the DAO will decide if it wants to move forward in funding more of the whole film.\n\n---\n### Proposal Ask:\n**125,000 USD for a time-period of 90 days**\n\n- Pre-production & character development\n- Script for the Pilot (3.5 mins) / ACT 1 + Summaries of all subsequent acts - delivered at 90 days\n- Animated Teaser with final look for the show - delivered at 45 days \n- Animated Pilot (Runtime 3.5 mins) with the above mentioned script - delivered at 90 days\n\n*transferred to Atrium Multi-sig upon execution*\n\n---\n\nNote: *Subsequent funding pathway for future Acts as detailed below with the rough timeline*. As we go further along the production (optional and will come in different proposals), the timeline gets more efficient and shrinks.\n\n\n\n### Recap: what is Atrium?\nAtrium.art is a crypto-native network of independent artists and creators. Disciplines represented on Atrium currently include Screenwriting, Animation, Concept Art, Voice Actors, and Music production. Together, creatives on Atrium bring experience from Pixar, Marvel, Luma Pictures, Sony, Netflix and many more.\nYou can see the work of Artists on Atrium [here](https://atrium.art/)\nSimply put, Atrium is a way to easily piece together veteran talent to produce cinematic content.\n\n\n### Resident Atrium Team\nMain Creative leads:\n\n[Zendoubt](https://zendoubt.art/) (Creative Director) - Black Panther, Godzilla vs Kong, Thor Ragnarok, Birds of Prey\n![](https://i.imgur.com/opKf6Pr.jpg)\n\n[HKJay](https://hkjay.com/) (Creative Director) - The Sea Beast, Lego Movies, Peter Rabbit, His Dark materials\n![](https://i.imgur.com/F5KrKIg.png)\n\n[3dprintguy](https://atrium.art/artist/3d-print-guy) (Executive Producer)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/rmzvlQT.jpg)\n\nWriting Lead :\n[William Yu](https://twitter.com/its_willyu) - BlckList 2021 , Created [#starringjohncho](https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-trending-36253081) campaign\n![](https://i.imgur.com/p5x3DE2.png)\n\nExternal Studio Partner (tentative)\nhttps://meta-ent.com/meta/ - Creators of Riri, [Mave: Pandora](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wGOHbcQKIc)\n\nIn addition we are assembling a veteran team of creatives (10-14) associating with an external studio partner who will help set up a dedicated production pipeline to handle the needed throughput of the content. This alongside Atrium core will be entirely remote first so it will be the first non-trivial budget content workflow at this scale being funded by nouns.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/UVaImTv.png)\n\nAdditionally Atrium will be sourcing Voice Over Artists, Sound Design resources for \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/9iJ30qE.png)\n\n\n---\n\n### Scope of this proposal (Detailed view)\n*An elaborate pre-production stage is crucial in order to explore the style and feel of a large production before locking / committing to it for the entire duration. These early steps of engagement and experimentation allow us to save time and money by avoiding costly redesigns later.* \n\nDuring Prop 195, While we created a unique and upbeat version of Nountown with character design that were standard, exploring uniqueness with heads and attire; We realised that there was scope to also explore pathways to develop a style framework that introduces : \n- More personality via body types\n- Introduce unique worlds beyond nountown\n\n#### Pre-production\n##### Animation Tests done in public\nThis early stage style exploration allows us to converge on something that will feel coherent and appropriate for the larger production. \n\nAn example of this pre-production work is a screen test done by Sony Animation for a feature length Popeye film: https://youtu.be/M1lzJuwJD9k?t=122\nWhilst this screen test is much more elaborate and polished than we intend, Sony would have done many smaller ones leading up to this very polished result which they were proud to make public.\n\nBy doing an animation screen test we can experiment with different looks in order to find the right one. This can also serve as future reference for other Nouns animated content, as different possible “looks”.\n\nUnlike Sony Animation, we have the advantage of building in the public eye, giving a rare glimpse into the animation process as well as giving the community a chance to share their sentiment prior to committing to a style..\n\n##### Looks Tests done in public\nThe designs, the texturing and lighting of the world. Does the world feel more clean or is it more grungy like stop motion, E.G. Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio. There are many possibilities to explore. Here are just a few examples.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/fXr0zYd.jpg)\n\n#### Deliverable #1 : (45 days mark)\nScreen tests in different looks + a teaser trailer for the Pilot Episode to come at 90 days mark. \n\n#### Story\nThe future of this cinematic story creation begins with a pilot screenplay, but will expand throughout subsequent acts in a way that allows for adults, teens, and kids to find something relatable within the world that is created. \nThe foundations of existing Nounish stories (prop 70, prop 116) will serve as a guide for cultural relevance and overall thematic inspiration for the story but will be unique in its own right. Unlike standard film productions, our build in public stance detailed below will invite the community to experience the magic of production first hand.\n\n#### Building in Public\n- We will be setting up a dedicated corner on the Atrium Server and sharing progress on socials for people to follow-along with the creative process. We plan to release regular media updates and share sneak peeks.\n\n- Anyone inside and outside the Nouns community is welcome to join. Most channels will be open to Public while some production related channels will be private to have agility on creative decisions. \n\n- We will host multiple open town halls with Creatives & the community members to hear ideas and keep the community updated on the process and progress.\n\n- *Casting Calls Galore:* As the Story is being written, we will be introducing an interactive exercise to do casting calls from the nounish community, where we make the picks on the main and auxiliary characters from the submitted / interested community members from nouns DAO and sub DAOs.\n\n- Behind the scenes videos and animation technicals to be produced alongside the content and be distributed after the premiere happens in between the premiere.\n\n#### Deliverable #2 : (90 days mark)\nPilot Episodic premiering on all socials and a Drop Proposal.\n\n#### Ask Summary Recap\n![](https://i.imgur.com/NgL4vbW.png)\n\n----\n### Future Funding Roadmap & Breakdown\n\n*Note: This is optional and only shared as a future roadmap. This is NOT part of this specific proposal scope and will be subjected to their own evaluation parameters.*\n\nIt’s a first of its kind, large production endeavour which attempts to break-free from legacy content production models and Nouns DAO is at the precipice of being the only few who can enable this. When you look at traditional animated film funding today, they can range from micro budgets (Less than 1M USDC) to Jumbo budgets (200M+), and the bulk is paid for [star actors](https://www.cartoonbrew.com/artist-rights/steve-carell-minions-12-5-million-dollars-219015.html), studio supervisors, and executives. Tangled (with a whopping 260M production cost) was one of the costliest animated features made.\n\nAs we are aware, many times it is normal for incredible artists to drown out and be siloed in suboptimal work culture and long hours in the animation industry, alongside their creative input. Offering budgets that can be competitive while retaining a much higher degree of creative autonomy (in absence of network executives) , we can give them the financial security to leave a traditional studio structure and be part of a long-term vision which seeks to upend the narrative. \n\nAll the team members defined in this proposal already have shown full commitment to come onboard if this series of proposals kicks off and embark on creating one of the highest quality production value the crypto space has seen till date. \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/5R6YDTS.png)\n\nThis continues till Act 22 and 77 mins total including the pilot (3.5 mins). It runs for 550+ days if funded all the way.\n\n\n### Past Funding from the DAO\n3dprintguy at Atrium was funded for 20 ETH via [Prop 195](https://nouns.wtf/vote/237) and created a standalone animated short film. The same short film is to be released via a Drop proposal ([Prop 237](https://nouns.wtf/vote/237)). All significant characters that are part of the short film were released as collectible NFTs and [usable rigged 3d files](https://twitter.com/passingbags/status/1626410532507906053) were made available for free for anyone to use.\n\n\n### Drop Content Proposals as we go\nDropping Content selectively through the DAO and coordinating premiere events coinciding with the Nouns mint will be a key event over the course of all of the proposals. \n\nAll proceeds from the Drop Proposals will be split (60 [DAO] : 40 [Creators]) with the DAO.\n\n\n### Our North Star\nThe journey does not end at the final second of content upon release. Nouns ecosystem members will be invited to submit story arcs for the future and ideas for the next runs once the core foundation and engine have been established.\n\nWe aim to self distribute the media (via socials & other partners) and our own channels to the widest audience possible and aggregate as much meaningful data as possible for an eventual streaming distribution deal.\n\n----\n\n### Appendix\n\n\nSelf-sustaining creator flywheels\n[https://twitter.com/pbrianandj/status/1610695135414845440](https://twitter.com/pbrianandj/status/1610695135414845440)\n\nDevelop Film and TV like its 2023\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Iwy1zcJ.png)\n\n[https://pricepoint.substack.com/p/price-point-018-how-to-develop-film](https://pricepoint.substack.com/p/price-point-018-how-to-develop-film)\n[https://twitter.com/punk4156/status/1613278290130931712](https://twitter.com/punk4156/status/1613278290130931712)\n[https://twitter.com/js_horne/status/1628203483949150208](https://twitter.com/js_horne/status/1628203483949150208)\n\n\nAtrium Multi-sig\n0x58947f539f1c1e930c2aea6e8a9fb0ecc9763357","proposer":"0x008c84421dA5527F462886cEc43D2717B686A7e4","startBlock":16770521,"endBlock":16806521,"executed":true},"votes":[{"support":1,"voter":"0x7D81478Ad18ad375e53De6F74F3122F6be3499ca","numberOfVotes":2,"reason":"i know a no brainer when i see one"},{"support":1,"voter":"0xE26D78c6bFF297Bbc2dA3f80FEA9a42028a4260F","numberOfVotes":4,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x7f64C6e6908DE72221A06A06b4a02A6546a4d6d2","numberOfVotes":2,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x008c84421dA5527F462886cEc43D2717B686A7e4","numberOfVotes":36,"reason":"High quality art and high quality narrative art can scale meme-wise better than almost anything.

In this world, we would have no need for rules or principles. But in our world, voting is a reality. So we have a simple rule: we only vote against. We use a “Squad Vote” for each proposal. If more people vote against than vote for or abstain, we vote against on-chain. Otherwise, we abstain. This is our rule.\n\nAccording to the “squad vote” result for proposal 241, which is 13 for, 19 against and 13 abstain, we choose to vote abstain.\n\nThere's a lot of controversy surrounding this proposal, with only a four-vote difference between those against and those for/abstaining.\n\nSupporting Points:\n1. Atrium has proven their production capability. With a previous proposal, they delivered a remarkable 2-minute video with impressive speed and content, standing out from previous video proposals with poor delivery in NounsDAO.\n2. Atrium's video is relatively cost-effective compared to other high-quality videos.\n\nOpposing Points:\n1. For the same cost, ten meme shorts could have better reach. Nouns should focus on storytelling and creating memes  instead of high-quality.\n2. Proposal 195 video fails to demonstrate the team's storytelling ability. There are no memes or compelling stories, and there is no motivation for secondary creation and propagation. The video has only received 86 shares, 166 likes, and 40,000 views. Moreover, the TikTok link on Zora is invalid. The video appears soulless with exquisite 3D models but a flat and bland story.\n3. Nouns Town in Proposal 195 has no Nouns elements.

There are 3 statuses a funded proposal might have: completed, in progress, or rugged. As a DAO we should have a clear understanding of the status of all proposals, information related to the progress, and proof of completion which also acts as an easy way for the community to see the end result of a proposal.\n\n## Solution\n\nThe solution for this is the Nouns Proposal Tracker which acts like a wiki for funded proposals.\n\nThis platform tracks funded proposals in real time and allows Noun holders, delegates, and proposal owners to add information about a funded proposal such as the status, progress logs, proof of completion, and comments. \n\nProposals can be sorted by their status to easily give an overview of how many and what types of proposals were completed, or are in progress and how many proposers rugged the DAO.\n\nBy getting a glimpse of potential rugs we can also try to follow-up with the owners of rugged proposals to see if there is a chance to have the work completed. If there is not it's important that these people are held accountable in some way.\n\n## Nouner and Delegate Permissions\n\nNouners and their delegates will be able to modify the status of proposals, add comments/questions, and add proof of completion. Any nouner or delegate can modify the status at any time. \n\n## Proposal Owner Permissions\n\nWallets that submitted proposals have the same permissions as nouners and delegates. They can also add additional wallets which can post on a specific proposal. In addition to the Nouner/delegate permissions proposal owners and their admin wallets can add progress logs. These logs can detail the progress of a given proposal.\n\n## Open-sourced\n\nAll code will be open-sourced for others to fork, build upon, or improve. Repo will have README file the includes instructions on how to run the project locally and contribute to the code base. \n\n## Adding to Nouns Frontend\n\nI can submit a pull request into the Nouns front end repo to add a link to this platform on the DAO page so it can be easily found. We can highlight its uses for those submitting proposals. \n\n## Team \n\nDeployer\n\nOwner of Noun 375 and 609. I am a serial builder and have been building in the NFT space since 2017. I authored ERC2309 which is an ethereum standard allowing for the efficient tracking of a large amount of NFTs across platforms. I built an early NFT platform, called Cargo, which included multi chain minting tools, asset management, a robust JS library, and marketplace that securely processed 10s of millions of dollars worth of transactions.\n\nAs of late I am building the Heroes ecosystem. Heroes started as a CC0 NFT project which stored character stats and traits on chain for people to build upon. The core team is now building a robust web3 powered, free to play game in the spirit of open world building, CC0, and collaboration.\n\nRelated to Nouns I did the frontend and backend development of the Noun O'clock App as part of the Nouns Client prop house.\n\n**Timeline**\n3 months \n\n**Funding ask**\n30 ETH - Development\n3 ETH - 1 year infrastructure costs\n\nTotal 33 ETH","proposer":"0x538C4F2AfA012911851dAdf0655cb61377e7a8EB","startBlock":16772277,"endBlock":16808277,"executed":false},"votes":[{"support":1,"voter":"0x538C4F2AfA012911851dAdf0655cb61377e7a8EB","numberOfVotes":2,"reason":""},{"support":0,"voter":"0x5606B493c51316A9e65c9b2A00BbF7Ff92515A3E","numberOfVotes":17,"reason":""},{"support":0,"voter":"0x4754b7e3DEde42D71d6c92978f25F306176EC7e9","numberOfVotes":7,"reason":""},{"support":0,"voter":"0x8ac3ecf6973E020cC0E6e8989Fb71B4a77D65987","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":"Full reasoning on my newsletter: https://cbites.substack.com/p/active-governance-noun-582-3"}]},{"prop":{"id":247,"description":"# Rage Quit\n\n\n# Rage Quit\n\n**Rage Quit Contract**: `0x95852813766e4A3112891FE6a47100023D61e5a4`\n\n### Summary\n\nRQ has been a topic discussed many times but hasn't been actually implemented. With a growing number of disgruntled members of this DAO, rage quit should have been an option a long time ago. Thank you to all members who have delegated their votes to me.\n\nThe primary argument that prevented RQ was that RQ somehow makes Nouns a security and holds the DAO liable for breaking SEC laws. This is quite flawed as the DAO already operates in grey waters in relation to SEC regulations. \n\n- The DAO has already acted as seed investors in proposals and mimics an investment syndicate.\n- Nouns are essentially class A shares for an entity with a large treasury.\n- A large portion of the treasury is in stETH which is an active area of discussion of whether it is a security or not.\n\nIf someone wanted to argue that NounsDAO breaks securities laws, they would have already done so, adding rage quit does not *suddenly* make Nouns a security.\n\n### Rage Quit Details\n\nThis implementation is the simplest form of RQ (the contract is only ~100 lines minus comments), we didn’t want to add any smart contract complications. The flow goes as follows:\n\n1. The treasury will fund the RQ contract in rounds. Round 1 will consist of 25% of the treasury (25% of the ETH and 25% of the stETH). If Round 1 is fully claimed (25% of Nouns have rage quit), another RQ proposal to fund Round 2 will be submitted to fund another 25% (and so on and so on). The reasoning for rounds is that we don’t want to handicap the DAO by taking custody of all funds while RQ is in process.\n\n2. Round 1 will be active for 2 weeks, during that time, holders that wish to ragequit will transfer their Nouns to the RQ contract and receive their book value of the treasury. The reason we lock Nouns into the contract versus burn Nouns is because only the DAO has the permissions to burn Nouns, thus, the DAO can retrieve all Nouns from the contract at any point.\n\n3. In the case there are funds left in the RQ contract after the deadline (no more people want to rage quit), the DAO can take back all remaining funds.\n\n4. Only Nouns up to `Noun #634` (the last noun before this proposal) **will be eligible for RQ**. This is to prevent new bidders from attempting to arbitrage new Nouns that get auctioned until the prop passes/fails. We are aware that there are Nouns on secondary (currently 12) that may be arbed against the treasury but the way we look at it, these Nouns will be used to get RFV from the treasury regardless. The Nouns selling on secondary below RFV will either be delisted and claimed for RFV or someone will buy the Noun and *potentially* claim for RFV. Thus, the treasury doesn’t gain more rage quitters from the Nouns on secondary (at the very best people that buy don't rage quit).\n\n**The current book value for each Nouns is calculated as follows:**\n\nETH book value for 1 Noun is `19 ETH`. This is the treasuries ETH balance **rounded down** with a 5% rage quit fee, the total is also rounded down - `floor(13144 eth / 634 * 0.95)`.\n\nStETH book value for 1 Noun is `22 ETH`. This is the treasuries StETH balance **rounded down** with a 5% rage quit fee, the total is also rounded down - `floor(14764 eth / 634 * 0.95)`.\n\n### Review of the contract:\n\nMost of the variables are immutable constants as to prevent any malicious prop that may siphon more funds out of the treasury. **Please ensure these values are correct**\n\n```\n    // final nounID that was auctioned before prop was submitted\n    uint256 public constant FINAL_ELIGIBLE_NOUN = 634;\n\n    // this is the eth treasury balance (rounded down) divided by 634 with a 5% tax\n    // floor(13144 / 634 * 0.95)\n    uint256 public constant ETH_BOOK_VALUE = 19 ether;\n\n    // this is the steth treasury balance (rounded down) divided by 634 with a 5% tax\n    // floor(14764 / 634 * 0.95)\n    uint256 public constant STETH_BOOK_VALUE = 22 ether;\n\n    // proxy address\n    address public constant NOUNS_DAO =\n        0x6f3E6272A167e8AcCb32072d08E0957F9c79223d;\n\n    // nouns treasury address\n    address public constant NOUNS_TREASURY =\n        0x0BC3807Ec262cB779b38D65b38158acC3bfedE10;\n\n    // nouns token address\n    address public constant NOUNS_TOKEN =\n        0x9C8fF314C9Bc7F6e59A9d9225Fb22946427eDC03;\n\n    // stETH address\n    address public constant STETH = 0xae7ab96520DE3A18E5e111B5EaAb095312D7fE84;\n```\n\n`function extendDeadline(uint256 _claimDeadline) external`: **This function can only be called via prop by the DAO**.

We’ve decided to vote against Nouns Prop 248. \n\nA key risk is that rage quit risks a stifling of treasury funds. Each treasury activation / funding grant would at least temporarily lower the book value of Nouns, so holders are faced with a trade-off every time they vote on a proposal: fund the prop vs. preserve the book value of their Noun. In theory, this creates a forcing function for better evaluating the merits of each prop – only props which are believed to drive future value to the DAO in excess of the current book value of each Noun would pass. In practice, that’s hard to quantify proactively. The consequence could be fewer funding approvals, especially for more provocative experiments that may not have as explicit financial returns. \n\nWe recognize that, even if this proposal is defeated, it’s likely not the last time we’ll see a rage quit proposal submitted to the Nouns DAO. In light of this, it’s worth taking a moment to revisit some of what makes Nouns special:\n\n\nThe ability to activate funds for bold, unique experiments in brand and community building\nHighly engaged community members\nA consistent source of funding (the daily auction)\n\nAny implementation of rage quit should seek to preserve those core primitives. 4156 has already proposed one alternative mechanism, whereby any Nouner who votes but lands in the minority on a proposal can rage quit as a sign of their dissent. This version would help encourage continued community engagement (by making voting a prerequisite to rage quitting), while preserving the ability of the community to access funding for projects. There may be other versions that preserve and protect the values of Nouns as well. We’re committed to evaluating each proposal on its individual merits. But today the version in question is what’s proposed in Prop 248, and we’re voting no.

In this world, we would have no need for rules or principles. But in our world, voting is a reality. So we have a simple rule: we only vote against. We use a “Squad Vote” for each proposal. If more people vote against than vote for or abstain, we vote against on-chain. Otherwise, we abstain. This is our rule.\n\nAccording to the “squad vote” result for proposal 241, which is 5 for, 18 against and 0 abstain, we choose to vote against.\n\nThe proposal's opinion is clear, and we do not recommend taking Rage Quit immediately. It's not just an issue with the content of the proposal itself, but also the caution regarding the level of the proposal.\n\nOur opposing viewpoints:\n\n1. Refuse to change the constitutional-level rules of the DAO without evidence that Rage Quit is effective (MolochDAO rarely uses Rage Quit) or sufficient community debate. Proposals of this level require lengthy debate, repeated proposals and opposition, and then approval. Changing the underlying rules lightly is irresponsible to the consensus. It is normal for a system to have human flaws at every level. However, a casual attitude towards underlying rules could destroy the Nouns system, a stable system is better than no system.\n2. NounsDAO already has a secondary market exit method. Rage Quit is a term that appears powerful on the surface, but in essence, it is a bad price market-making way. It does not have the game-theoretical effect it promises.\n3. The importance behind Rage Quit is not angry, but forking. The execution of this proposal did not enhance the system or generate more viable branches, but resulted in a loss of consensus, which is negative on the margin. Instead, leaving feedback for continuous improvement of the system can turn it into a way to enhance the system. The efficiency of Nouns proposal supervision has also been improving and will continue to progress.\n4. The proposal implies that everyone is angry, which is a language game. The fact is that most users have a mixed feeling of disappointment and hope. Any one-sided release of hope or anger will damage a system.\n5. Earlier proposal 192 had a more comprehensive rage quit design called theDAO Split mechanism/design. The proposer, Verbs team, pointed out that although it is still under discussion with legal counsel, they believe it is the best solution for Nouns. They are now soliciting community opinions and think it is very urgent to implement it as soon as possible.\n\nThe supporting viewpoints for this proposal are very simple:\n1. Promote the equal vision of Nouns: Each Nouns subdao represents Nouns, and NounsDAO is just one branch. This is a more attractive future, a dynamic and ongoing future."},{"support":1,"voter":"0x19Cc9d48f2032f3EC8d6f60EA84979169A848231","numberOfVotes":2,"reason":""},{"support":0,"voter":"0xb5A497ce6B9843E5936B9da985174c0906520387","numberOfVotes":3,"reason":""},{"support":0,"voter":"0x8ac3ecf6973E020cC0E6e8989Fb71B4a77D65987","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":"Reasons given in my newsletter: https://paragraph.xyz/@thebower/active-governance-noun-582-4"}]},{"prop":{"id":249,"description":"# Nouns block graffiti x ETH solo staking\n\n## TL;DR\n\nWe propose to create a 10 ETH monthly prize pool for the next three months where any solo staker that puts “⌐◨-◨” into their validator’s [graffiti flag](https://nimbus.guide/graffiti.html) can be permissionlessly eligible to win 1 ETH.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/MImNUFD.jpg)\n\n(paintbrush noun snacking after a hard day of nouns graffiti; CC0 art by [brandonmighty](https://foundation.app/@brandonmighty/nounsatwork/6))\n\n---\n\n## Why should Nouns incentivize solo staking?\n\nWe see solo staking as something incredibly nounish. It embodies a desire to contribute to the production and maintenance of a public good (in this case Ethereum’s decentralization) with the optimistic view that individuals’ independent judgment and actions [can make a difference](https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1595793106926014466).\n\nHowever, solo staking, as the name suggests, can be quite lonely. So we wanted to help make it more fun by introducing a distinctly nounish playful & absurdist element: a nouns block graffiti prize pool.\n\n## How can you participate?\n\nIf you already have a staking setup, all you need to do is add “⌐◨-◨” to the graffiti flag of your consensus client.\n\nIf you aren’t yet a staker, but always wanted to and this prop is motivating you to stake some of your ETH, then that’s amazing and we’ll be rooting for you! \n\nThe easiest way to solo stake from home (in our opinion) is [buying an Intel NUC](https://twitter.com/superphiz/status/1546302759439421440) (along with 2TB SSD and 32GB RAM chips) and setting up Dappnode, an open source node operator that helps you install and run Ethereum clients of your choice. You can also buy a ready-to-use staking node from [Dappnode’s store](https://dappnode.com/en-us/collections/frontpage) which makes it is even easier.\n\n## How will the prizes be paid out?\n\nThe prize ETH will initially be held in a multisig. At the end of each month, starting April, we will initiate a 10 ETH transaction to a smart contract (to be developed) that randomly selects 10 winners amongst a list of candidate validator addresses.\n\nWe’ll use the following options as the validator's address (in this order): A) validator’s ENS (if included in the block graffiti), B) withdrawal address (if set by the validator), and C) the “from” address of the staking deposit transaction. \n\nThe spirit of this proposal is to celebrate and incentivize solo stakers. If we find that a large staking pool is attempting to ruin the fun, we’ll disclose those validators publicly on Twitter and not include them as potential prize candidates.\n\n## How can you follow along?\n\nWe’ll create a site that showcases the ⌐◨-◨ graffiti blocks etched into the Ethereum blockchain. We might also create a Twitter bot that tweets out whenever a new block with noggles is discovered.\n\n\n## Who are the volunteers running this program?\n\n[Noun 40](https://twitter.com/noun40__), [gregskril.eth](https://twitter.com/gregskril), and [Ripe](https://twitter.com/ripe0x).\n\n\n## Any additional resources for solo staking?\n\n* [How to stake on Ethereum](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethstaker/comments/tvlnck/how_to_stake_on_ethereum_april_2022_edition/) — a bit outdated but still the best comprehensive writeup on eth staking by [superphiz](https://twitter.com/superphiz).\n* [Hardware for staking](https://old.reddit.com/r/ethstaker/comments/rizos9/hardware_for_staking_2022_edition/) — a good run through of the hardware options by [Lamboshi](https://twitter.com/L_Nakaghini).\n* Ethstaker — a [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethstaker/) and [discord](http://discord.io/ethstaker) community of eth stakers where you can search for commonly asked questions and get help.\n* [Tweet thread](https://twitter.com/noun40__/status/1627009674603290624) of Noun 40 recently going through the whole process of solo saking from home. \n* [Client Diversity](https://clientdiversity.org/) — a site to check Ethereum’s current client diversity.

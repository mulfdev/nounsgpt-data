[{"prop":{"id":100,"description":"# Make Nouns VISIBLE FROM SPACE + Ubiquitous at the Largest Charity Beer Garden & Tailgate in the Country\n\nWe respectfully seek Nouns support to maintain public access to a well-established charity beer garden just steps from the largest stadium in the country (#3 in the world). In return, we offer extraordinary Nouns visibility — from the ground, the air, ***even from space***— to eight of the largest event crowds of the year. The iconic Nouns glasses will be omnipresent, allowing Nouns to make a great first impression on a vast new audience mostly unfamiliar with NFTs or DAOs. \n\nWe will *literally* put Nouns on the map and make them part of the permanent record — the first NFT/PFP icon visible from Earth orbit — when Nouns glasses appear in updated satellite maps (Google Earth/Maps, etc.), visible to everyone at the event, near the event, or simply looking for directions near a major university and sports destination.\n\nI founded the Cancer Support Community charity beer garden after my wife was diagnosed with breast cancer. I ran it for years as an out-of-pocket labor of love. We were attracting tens of thousands of patrons each season and potential sponsors were taking notice when the pandemic shut everything down. Unable to continue funding on my own, I sold to an LLC but I retained an ownership share that allows me a chance to preserve the community event. I'm looking for an open-minded and nimble capital source to help the beer garden remain open to the public this fall while sponsors budget for FY2023. When @4156 tweeted an invitation (see below), it was clear that a DAO could be our saving grace. Relatively modest support could positively affect thousands of lives with a *MONUMENTAL* return on investment for the Nouns community.\n\n**Benefits to Nouns**\n\n* **MAKE NOUNS VISIBLE FROM SPACE** — massive Nouns glasses will be emblazoned on a synthetic turf installation. At 60 feet wide, they will be large enough to be visible when satellite maps are updated, meaning they'll become part of the permanent record, obvious to anyone on site *and* to anyone using Google Earth/Maps or other online navigation tools near the largest stadium in the country and a top university. Because synthetic turf doesn't require cutting and won't wear down under foot, the glasses can stay as long as it takes for the next satellite maps update. \n![](https://i.imgur.com/YA4IZkR.jpg)\n\n\n* **Nouns billboard/banner** — 12-foot Nouns glasses will watch over the crowd, evident not only to the thousands of beer garden guests but unmistakable, even at a distance, to the tens of thousands walking past on game day.\n![](https://i.imgur.com/M1i9gW2.png)\n\n\n\n* **Nouns pole banners** — Nouns ubiquity continues as glasses appear in pairs on pole banners flying high above the crowd.\n![](https://i.imgur.com/AtRFjN2.png)\n\n\n* **Drone photos + press release** — a licensed drone photographer will capture images of the multitude of Nouns glasses *in situ* to accompany a press release describing the event and directing people to learn more about Nouns DAO.\n\n* **TBD special event** — plans are in motion to turn the night game on September 10 into an extended affair to remember with music stage and celebrity appearances.\n\n* **And more** — Nouns glasses and URL on event signage, pint cups, staff t-shirts, event website, press release, social media, etc.\n\n**What does this mean for Nouns?** \n\n* **Proliferation** and public relations on a colossal scale: The eight-game event season will put Nouns in front of more *new eyes* than any other event. Unlike NFT-oriented gatherings where attendees are familiar with Nouns (e.g., NFT.NYC), sponsorship at the largest normie events of the year will introduce an entirely new population to the DAO in a positive and productive light — doing good for the community. There are incredible opportunities to expand Nouns brand recognition with in-person visitors immersed in Nouns iconography and countless others learning the Nouns story through media coverage of events.\n\n* **Nounish culture**: what better way to reinforce the Nouns ethos than to support an inclusive community event and serve as ambassadors to the web3 ecosystem.\n\n* **Diversity**: there's no other event like this. Nouns would be on the vanguard of DAO philanthropy, supporting the largest charity event of its kind. In return, Nouns would be the first NFT/PFP visible from earth orbit.\n\n* **Successful track record**: this isn't a request to gamble on our success, it's a well-established event looking to remain publicly accessible in its post-pandemic return. Since it began in 2016, the beer garden has attracted tens of thousands of patrons each season and grossed six figures for charity.\n\n**Who else is involved?**\nNouns DAO will join a roster of CONFIRMED partners. We're still negotiating sponsorships with a few other key players (\"TBA\" below).  We've already pitched DAO membership to some of them and plan to invite the others to join us in the web3 space. Ideally, the event series will grow in subsequent seasons with support from new high-profile Nouns DAO members.\n\n* **[Truly Hard Seltzer](https://trulyhardseltzer.com/)** — the #2 player in the hard seltzer category will expand beer garden options for thirsty patrons.\n![](https://i.imgur.com/5WDruFd.png)\n\n* **[Twisted Tea](https://www.twistedtea.com/)** — The #1 contender in the FMB sector will add even more depth to the drink lineup.\n![](https://i.imgur.com/ziz2bks.png)\n\n\n* **[Slows Bar BQ](https://slowsbarbq.com/)** — Detroit's finest barbecue has been featured every season since 2016 and their food truck will be back this fall with premium tailgate fare.\n![](https://i.imgur.com/1KvVKdv.png)\n\n* **[Zingerman's Creamery](https://www.zingermanscreamery.com/)** (& coffee) — the creamery arm of Zingerman's Deli, one of the best in the Midwest, will provide gelato and/or hot coffee/cocoa depending on the game day weather forecast.\n![](https://i.imgur.com/jU8Qi2e.png)\n\n* **[Hotaling & Co](https://www.hotalingandco.com/).** — their whiskey warehouse survived the 1906 San Francisco earthquake and fire long before they became a leader in super-premium artisanal spirits; they will augment the drink menu with custom cocktails, including a signature drink created for the occasion.\n![](https://i.imgur.com/RYBPJNl.png)\n\n\n* **[**Cancer Support Community**** — the local chapter](https://www.cancersupportannarbor.org/) of the [national](https://www.cancersupportcommunity.org/) 501(c)(3) non-profit organization is our co-host, securing the state special permit for alcohol service at the beer garden; CSC volunteers staff the event and pour drinks.\n![](https://i.imgur.com/G9Q0nbv.png)\n\n* TBA **national brand soft drink partner** — the largest distributor for the #1 soft drink brand in the US has signed on to provide non-alcoholic options. We're still lobbying for a partnership with the cola giant. Stay tuned.\n\n* TBA **national brand beer partner** — we're in conversations with a leading national beer brand portfolio and hope to see them become a major sponsor and the next prominent beverage company to join Nouns DAO.\n\n* TBA we're chatting with, but still have to confirm, a premium **handmade Vodka out of Austin, TX** to supplement our cocktail lineup\n\n* We've snagged **DJ WaltAmore** (house DJ at Tin Roof, Detroit) to spin for us this season\n\n* We've engaged the services of a sports marketing professional with experience in charitable event planning for organizations, pro athletes, and their non-profit endeavors. More info TBA.\n\n**What does this mean to the charity? What happens if the proposal fails?**\nIn short, Nouns support provides a stay of execution for the *publicly accessible* event. Without sponsor support to maintain community access, the charity beer garden will not return in 2022. Instead, the site will be turned over to private and corporate interests. It's a manifestation of the conflict between web2 and web3...centralized ownership versus open access. \n\nA successful DAO vote means the charity event sees new life *plus* a foundation for future growth. As in the past, 100% of beer/seltzer/FMB/cocktail sales will benefit Cancer Support Community programming: education; counseling; financial assistance; healthy living (exercise, stress management, nutrition) programming; social activities for adults, teens and children; and other CSC fundraising events. Enthusiastic national brands are poised to underwrite the future of the series but, in the middle of a fiscal cycle, budget dollars have already been allocated. Nouns sponsorship this fall would provide a bridge to next season when beverage and other brand sponsors can earmark funds for their participation.\n\nIn sports entertainment marketing circles, this location is a unicorn. Of roughly two dozen properties covered by a city council resolution granting broad game day allowances to specific properties in the stadium vicinity, it's the only available vacant parcel this large. Sponsorship value has been estimated by sports marketing agencies at $12-18/sqft per game based on site characteristics, recent team performance, and media coverage that accompanies the nationally televised events around which the beer garden is scheduled.\n\n* Proximity to venue — 285 yards to stadium gate\n* Generous open space — over 10,000 square feet\n* Privately owned — no municipal or university red tape\n* Existing municipal approvals for game day sales and commercial display\n* No neighbors to complain — no residential units within 400 feet\n\nHaving a respected and successful history here, the charity event has a right of first refusal to remain...but only if we can secure a sponsor. If we continue, the beer garden will offer the closest alcohol sales to the largest football crowd in the country at a stadium that doesn't serve beer (and the nearest bar a mile away). \n\n**What is the ask?**\nThe benefits to the community are beyond measure but the cost is easy to quantify — roughly the equivalent of two freshly minted Nouns. Let's check the math: the average price of a new Noun over the past 30 days is just under 110 ETH. Assuming/hoping ETH doesn't fall below $1050 before we can successfully float this proposal, two Nouns would total $220,500 — just under the minimum needed to keep the event in public hands (see cost breakdown below). \n\nAt the YTD average mint price (a conservative 80 ETH per Noun) the DAO treasury will increase by almost 6,000 ETH before the event series starts in September. We respectfully request 225.15 ETH, a little over twice the daily mint price, to preserve the community charity event. \n\n**Why are we asking Nouns for help?**\nIt's been asked, \"why should Nouns sponsor this particular event?\" There is no inherent link between Nouns and a college football beer garden but there are extraordinary benefits for both parties. A year after meeting @4156, his tweet on Feb. 17 was a welcome invitation to engage an open-minded and responsive community. “**Shill us your crazy ideas**,” he said, “**we will fund them!**” If I couldn't send a Nouns to space but I could make Nouns visible FROM space. The Nounish ethos of bootstrapped identity and community is embodied in what we've achieved and hope to continue. \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/M75Hg6R.png)\n\n\n\n**Where will the money go?**\nBefore the current bearish dip, 225 ETH would have been enough to ensure a long and healthy future for the beer garden. It's still enough to fund the bare-bones improvements to benefit Nouns and the event series. If funded, we'd convert crypto to fiat immediately to cover the synthetic turf installation. The Nouns flags and banners described above would be out-of-pocket-expenses. The list below includes improvements that will follow as additional funding allows (calculated at $1050/ETH).\n\n* **224 ETH: Synthetic turf installation INCLUDING 60-FOOT NOUNS GLASSES** — we've been quoted a 1.5-inch finished pile that uses an environmentally friendly backing and infill with realistic color and exceptional durability and drainage. Turf materials, excavation and installation run $14/sqft for 11,000 feet of coverage. Ultrabase underlayment panels ($6/sqft) will go in between the compacted gravel base and the turf/infill to handle large vehicle traffic (food trucks, beer trailers, buses, dumpster service, portajohn maintenance). Infill and perimeter board add $15,000 to bring the total cost to $235,000.\n\n* **0.4 ETH: Nouns Glasses Billboard/Banner** — One 6x12' heavy-duty vinyl outdoor banner with grommets and heat-welded hems \n\n* **0.75 ETH Nouns Pole Banners** — Four double-sided 2x5' pole banners and hangers, to install in pairs on two utility poles on site\n\n**Is that the end of it? What comes next?**\nTwo Nouns (225 ETH) allows the charity event to last another year, allowing time to negotiate future sponsorship. If this proposal succeeds and Nouns feedback is positive, we may draft a follow-up proposal to name Nouns as the lead sponsor of the event. It wouldn't take much to get there...maybe the equivalent of a third Noun:\n\n* **72 ETH: Fifty 10-foot Polysteel Picnic Tables** — community seating for up to 500 people at once (excl. shipping or assembly)\n\n* **25 ETH: One 40x100' frame tent with water ballast tanks** — it's less expensive to purchase than to rent for the eight events in a single charity season (excl. dis/assembly & storage cost)\n\n\n**About me, the location, and the charity:**\nI spent more than two decades as a professional photographer, winning two Emmy Awards and a pair of national POY honors before moving into software where I helped commercial and educational clients manage and monetize digital assets. I started my own business but continue to pursue this labor of love. I avoid the spotlight so there are more mentions of the charity organization than of me in Google search results. I bought the property in 2007 and hosted the community event free of charge until I was unable to sustain my out-of-pocket support and gave up control to an LLC. I remain a member so I have the opportunity to seek sponsorship for the charity event before the LLC turns the property over to private interests.\n\nWhy wait so long to say *WHERE* this event takes place? Because sports fans have passionate feelings about which teams they do and don't support. The largest stadium in the country, in Ann Arbor, Michigan, is home to a team that engenders strong feelings, for *and* against.  I didn't want non-fans to react to the team before understanding the benefits.\n\nThe cause that we support is the [local chapter](https://www.cancersupportannarbor.org/) of the national 501( c)(3) non-profit [Cancer Support Community](https://www.cancersupportcommunity.org/). One hundred per cent of beer sales go to the CSC to support education; counseling; financial assistance; healthy living (exercise, stress management, nutrition) programming; social activities for adults, teens and children; and other CSC fundraising events. The CSC is supportive of my Nouns outreach and the Director addressed a letter of support to any potential sponsors.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/nYsyunS.png)\n","proposer":"0xcC2688350d29623E2A0844Cc8885F9050F0f6Ed5","startBlock":15042935,"endBlock":15062645,"executed":true},"votes":[{"support":1,"voter":"0xa555d1Ee16780B2d414eD97f4f169c0740099615","numberOfVotes":2,"reason":""},{"support":0,"voter":"0x203cC9B81C53Fd649BD575E0E19925DD1a2A54da","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":"in short, it seems like a pretty niche thing for a lot of dinero. respekt the hustle however"},{"support":1,"voter":"0xcC2688350d29623E2A0844Cc8885F9050F0f6Ed5","numberOfVotes":12,"reason":"⌐◨-◨ 🍻"},{"support":2,"voter":"0x021edd67d43B365a6401a5Ee704Aa6f264F3F4e4","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0xC46Db2d89327D4C41Eb81c43ED5e3dfF111f9A8f","numberOfVotes":2,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x6223Bc5fd16a19bcFAe2281dDE47861CFE1023eE","numberOfVotes":2,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0xf6C625851d48FE26B50D96B821a87eFC7e35c222","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":"I am voting according to what was decided by a live vote by the audience on Noun Square’s Noun O’ Clock twitter space https://twitter.com/noun_o_clock\n\nThe proposer pitched their proposal and the audience voted live in our discord, see results here: https://discord.gg/m7FR2mhgWz"},{"support":1,"voter":"0x36A5Bc205DF1ED65C86301022cfc343a6ce546ff","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x33DaF8e90Cd1f214CC25A1865649e847254F2ece","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0xE30585034f5e2aC9635cF94D0Fd069D6BaC2F7bC","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x9a2F6117D1FFa82ad0A2B36f133d476DB5bD55F5","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x008c84421dA5527F462886cEc43D2717B686A7e4","numberOfVotes":5,"reason":"The dedication to making this Nounish, the persistence through so many iterations, and the quality of the Proposer."},{"support":1,"voter":"0x6f9e3976fa3b5b22761fe5D635E1f0d9d9aeB85d","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0xe085327c5AD2F77147F10973Fed45Fb19d734F7e","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0xBd7Dbab9AEb52D6c8d0E80fCeBdE3af4CC86204A","numberOfVotes":6,"reason":"⌐◨-◨ "},{"support":1,"voter":"0x91dCCAA260CC4616E1a6e6b693DB7207C5E42937","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0xD19BF5F0B785c6f1F6228C72A8A31C9f383a49c4","numberOfVotes":3,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0xcEb78aBFad166C11e350156fd671b385265a6C87","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0xA86882277E69FbF0a51805cdc8b0a3a113079E63","numberOfVotes":2,"reason":"The nouns from space (satellite imagery) aspect of this is exciting to me.

Administered by a thriving and growing community (join our [discord](https://discord.gg/qsUk2v4ZB3)!).\n- We've completed a 14 day pilot of daily spaces and contests every day, with excellent results.\n\n### Pilot Metrics\n-  ~110 daily attendees, 60+ daily FOMO players \n- 500+ twitter followers (up from 0)\n- 250K tweet impressions (!!) \n- 200+ pieces of nounish content produced in 9 daily contests \n- 400+ POAPs claimed for attending the spaces\n- 11 special nounish guests\n\n### Short term goals\n- Grow attendance & engagement\n- Iterate on show format and deepen our \"show/market fit\"\n- Grow our community of hosts and contributors \n\n### Longer term goals\n- Make NOC a global Internet shared moment\n- Grow reach to thousands of concurrent participants, and later much much more\n\n### Our Ask\n- We are asking for 55 ETH total to continue this initiative for a 1 month period.\n- Doing this daily is a lot of work (about 10 man-hour a day on average. More detailed breakdown below.)\n    - 10 ETH will be earmarked for contests themed around the Noun of the day. \n    - 45 ETH will go to community contributor rewards (biweekly retro rewards administered by CoordinApe rounds, modeled after Nouncil.)\n\n\n---\n\n## Who We Are\n\nWe are a community of Nounish builders setting out to create a Daily Celebration of Noun O’ Clock called The Noun Square, administered by a Nouncil-like body and with the goal of proliferating Nouns by turning Noun O’ Clock into a “Shared Moment” for the entire Internet. We have successfully completed two week pilot using a combination of Small Grants and out-of-pocket funds for prizes (data from which which has informed this proposal)   \n\n## Our vision\n\nFor anyone who grew up in the 70s, 80s or 90s, “The Price is Right” holds a special place in our collective psyche. For over 50 years, its daily blend of ritual and play has entertained hundreds of thousands of people the world over.  We believe Noun O’ Clock can recreate this kind of shared experience for web3.\n\n**Broad Goals:**\n\n- **Turn NOC into a daily shared global moment** - develop a grass-root, organic, daily show that introduces more people to  nouns & its thriving community & sub-communities. As well as creates a space in which our growing community can meet daily and share a live moment together.\n\n\n- **Model our community on Nouncil** - a collective of builders all over the globe with varied skillsets, collaborating to organize and administer a daily Twitter Spaces. We think that a decentralized community model can be the nounish way to scale a Noun O' Clock show! \n\n- **Be consistent (”one NOC, every day, forever”)** - Even in the deep NOC winter, we believe consistency is key to cementing NOC as a daily celebration for the Internet. We are planning ahead for this with hosts from all over the world.\n\n\n## The (Current) Format\n\n- Begin 15 min before NOC every day.\n- Contest review & announcements.\n- Casual guest interview while watching/discussing end of daily Noun auction.\n- Play FOMO Live together (we invite as many attendees as possible to come on stage and keep mics open for an interactive experience.)\n- Give live Secret Word for those who wish to collect POAP for attendance.\n\n*On weekends, we run a LITE version of The Noun Square featring only FOMO live, hosted by a different nounish community every Saturday (e.g. Lil Nouns and GOOP DAO the past two weeks, future guest hosts Nouns DAO Japan, Korean Noun Fans, NounPunks, FloriNouns, etc.)\n\n## The Team: 3 C's\n\n**Core Team (Responsible for Execution):**\n- Toady Hawk\n- Noun 142\n- Ser Noadz\n\n**Council (Responsible for Decisions and Daily Direction)**\n\n- SuperTightWoody\n- Goldy\n- Joshua Fisher\n- Maty\n- Benbodhi\n- !Xargs\n- Sam Ellis\n- Aubtoshi\n- RyanMac21\n\n**Community (Talent Funnel for Council)**\n- Growing Discord Community\n\n## Growing the community\n\n- We want to grow the community and **build in the open.** We have created a Discord server [open to anyone who wants to contribute.](https://discord.gg/qsUk2v4ZB3) We have also created a public Google Sheet that tracks our progress and metrics and future plans for [anyone to follow along](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-zmEFFLxUszyKZzo8CJP6KlXC581NkPLtek4GN6h7T8/edit?usp=sharing).\n- Hosting a live Spaces every day is an audacious goal (albeit one we are excited about), and will require participation and help from Nounsfolk in all timezones, especially as NOC drifts into the North American Night.\n\n## Compensation Model\n\nOur ask for the next 30 days is 55 ETH:\n\n- **Contest rewards (0.5 eth/day * 20 weekdays = 10 ETH)**\n    - We will experiment with these numbers and the cadence of them as we move forward, but so far this amount and cadence has produced excellent participation.\n\n- **Team reward + operations (see budget below): 45 ETH**\n    - Because we intend to build this initiative as a community effort, we will be modeling our team reward, at least for the first period, on Nouncil’s proven model of a Coordinape round, where all active participants will allocate tokens based on contributions.** We think this will ultimately be a fairer and more frictionless way of properly rewarding the team than attempting to itemize every hour of effort, etc.\n\n    - Based on our pilot, we  estimated how many man-hours it takes to run a show like this every day. We think these are reasonable overall estimates. \n    \n    \n![image.png](https://i.postimg.cc/wj7gtHWz/image.png)\n![image.png](https://i.postimg.cc/RZk5Nt61/image.png)\n\n## Multi-sig\nFunds will go a new 3/6 gnosis safe, with the following signers:\n\n- 142\n- Toadyhawk.eth\n- maty.eth\n- SuperTightWoody\n- Ser Noadz\n- Benbodhi\n\n\n\n# Two-week Pilot Results\n\n### Twitter analytics\n\nMassive reach within 14 days!\n\n![twitter-analytics-noc-jun-26.png](https://i.postimg.cc/1XK4RJYb/twitter-analytics-noc-jun-26.png)\n\n\n### Space Participation\n\n\n- Attendance has been growing every day to average around 115 people a day.\n- We hit FOMO players ATH at 110 on our first pilot space and have been averaging between 60-70 every day.\n- Twitter growing by approximately 30 followers per day so far.\n- Averaging 30 entries to our daily contest, with many high quality submissions.\n    - NB: Small Grants sponsored our first Week of contest prizes (thank you!) Noun Square Team members Toady Hawk and 142 have agreed to fund the current week’s prizes out of pocket to keep morale high pending approval or disapproval of this broader proposal.\n    \n![tracking-document-screenshot-noc.png](https://i.postimg.cc/wBbGZzqG/tracking-document-screenshot-noc.png)\n    \n(Excerpt Above from our [Public Tracking/Planning Document.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-zmEFFLxUszyKZzo8CJP6KlXC581NkPLtek4GN6h7T8/edit?usp=sharing))\n\n\n### The Contests\n\nInspired by 4156 ad-hoc contests a few weeks back, we have run 10 contests with really great engagement and wonderful creativity from noun lovers on twitter: \n![image.png](https://i.postimg.cc/ncsnrpSJ/image.png)\n\n![bag-found-art.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/fyB659r6/bag-found-art.jpg)\n\n\n![crown-haikus.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/SNZhfB0J/crown-haikus.jpg)\n\n\n### Gamifying NOC with POAPs\n\nWe are using POAPs to gamify NOC and create both engagement and loyalty. We feel that our use of Daily Attendance POAPs is the purest use case for the tech (literally “Proof of Attendance”) and we want to use them to incentivize people to attend Noun O’ Clock every single day if they can. \n\nSo far, it’s working! Ser Noadz has been creating amazing daily animated POAPs based on the new Noun of the Day and would continue to do so for the first month (after which we would explore other “Series” by other Nounish artists.) \n\n![IMG-2420.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/brHXK5FS/IMG-2420.jpg)\n\nWe also want to experiment with doing bonuses like physical Merch drops for those with provable streaks of attendance, and raffles that are easier to win the more times you have attended. \n\nExample Possible “The Noun Square” Merch Drop for Attendance Streaks:\n\n[![noc-cap-smallest.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/FK6V4gf9/noc-cap-smallest.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/FfjLbSgq)\n\n\n## Playing FOMO\n\nThe peak moment of The Noun Square is, of course, playing FOMO live and minting a new Noun together. When FOMO starts during the Twitter Space, we ask all speakers to unmute and speak their mind, to create as much chaos, interaction and fun as possible. The feedback so far has been that people have been loving it!  \n\nWe have noticed anecdotally that FOMO seems to take longer on average with more players, until we hit that beautiful noun that reaches some consensus. We think the Nouns minted over the past week or so are especially legendary, and believe it’s related to our efforts to gamify FOMO and bring in new players.\n\nThe impressive roster of Nouns minted by FOMO since we started: \n\n[![this-is-a-subliminal-message-to-vote-yes-on-our-proposal-lol.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/bYmCCbgw/this-is-a-subliminal-message-to-vote-yes-on-our-proposal-lol.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/NLrkLKZ3)\n\n\n\n## Our plan for the next 30 days\n\n- **Host a Noun o’ Clock every. single. day.**\n- **Make it fun & intereting:** Run a contests, and have guests for every weekday\n- **Be inclusive:** Invite a different nounish extension, subdao or community to host every weekend.\n- **Grow the NOC community:** Invite as many interested Nounsfolk to join our Discord and share ideas, volunteer to help where they can.\n- **Curate an Organizational Committee**: will handles all the day to day tasks to keep this going in a decentralized manner.\n- **Run a Coordinape round:** At the end of each 15 day period, reward contributors by Coordinape Round.\n\n**Grow our reach:**\n- **500k Tweet impressions** on our @noun_o_clock Twitter account.\n- **1000+ Twitter following** \n- Grow daily show attendance to 125 per day, and average FOMO Players to 85+.\n- Produce over 800 unique pieces of Nounish content in the form of public entries to our Noun O’ Clock contests. \n- Teach hundreds of new people about Nouns and Noun o’ Clock through our informative and entertaining spaces.\n\n**Potential challenges**\n\n1. July gets into very late night EST and we may have fewer participants. However, we believe that consistency is key, as well as the opportunity to get more people from non-north america timezones to hear about nouns.\n2. Over-saturation is a risk of course, as with anything that happens daily. But as with The Price is Right, we hope to create a shared ritual with the community we are building, such that the daily show is something they look forward to, rather than a chore they get bored of. We are building variety into the structure of the show, with a mixture of weekly segments and novel guests and contests to keep things interesting for many, many months (and hopefully longer!) \n\n**In Conclusion:**\n\nOver the past two weeks, we have kicked off a tradition of making Noun O’ Clock a daily celebration, featuring live Twitter Spaces, interactive contests and special guests. So far, people love it. (See feedback section below)\n\nWe believe that, if given funding to execute our vision detailed here, we can bring new attention to Nouns and the daily auction every day, while also supporting extension and sub-DAO communities, and engaging active Nounish builders. \n\n**Let’s work together to make Noun O’ Clock into a shared moment for the Internet!**\n\n**Feedback from attendees has been great:**\n\n> “The Noun Square gives a much needed voice to what is Nounish. A platform to congregate daily, learn and vibe, uniting Nounsfolk, and beyond, around the world!” *-Metamonk*\n> \n\n> “I don’t watch TV anymore, but I do miss the days when I would spend my evenings with David Letterman on the Late Show. It was home to me. And that is what the Noun O’ Clock team are doing right now. **It definitely feels like home to me.** ” *-Leo Clark*\n> \n\n> “This event is now something that I want to do every single day.  I am literally trying to figure out how to turn over my entire family's sleep schedule! Getting to hear my Nounish frens and what they are up to is amazing. **This event has also proven to be a wonderful way for me to onboard new folks into Nouns.** I leave this every day with dozens of new and Nounish ideas, and feeling great and motivated.” *-!xargs*\n> \n\n> “**Having a common and consistent place to gather for a Noun O’ Clock event is something folks need**--a kind of programming schedule that they can tap into every day. The engagement events have been fun and accessible and rotating guests have been a good way to introduce folks to extension projects while celebrating the nouns in general! The POAPS are great and give a feeling of being part of the history of the noun minted that day..” *-Sam Ellis*\n> \n\n> “For a couple months, I’ve tried to touch base in the Discord during FOMO as a fun way to interact with those in the Nouns eco system. **Having this extended virtual event via Spaces has taken that to a whole new level!** The Spaces, the guests (David Horvath!), the games, the prizes and the POAPs all bring different aspects of interaction, energy and motivation to attend.  Unlike 20 years ago, we rarely have shared cultural experiences as a society anymore (think TV show series finales etc.) **We have an opportunity to create one here that is open to everyone to enjoy on a global scale.** How exciting!” *- Prof Werder*\n>","proposer":"0xf6C625851d48FE26B50D96B821a87eFC7e35c222","startBlock":15044257,"endBlock":15063967,"executed":true},"votes":[{"support":1,"voter":"0xa555d1Ee16780B2d414eD97f4f169c0740099615","numberOfVotes":2,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x203cC9B81C53Fd649BD575E0E19925DD1a2A54da","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0xcC2688350d29623E2A0844Cc8885F9050F0f6Ed5","numberOfVotes":12,"reason":"One Noun Square, every day, forever. 🙏"},{"support":1,"voter":"0xC46Db2d89327D4C41Eb81c43ED5e3dfF111f9A8f","numberOfVotes":2,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x021edd67d43B365a6401a5Ee704Aa6f264F3F4e4","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x6223Bc5fd16a19bcFAe2281dDE47861CFE1023eE","numberOfVotes":2,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0xA86882277E69FbF0a51805cdc8b0a3a113079E63","numberOfVotes":2,"reason":"Building around NOC is a cultural superpower we should embrace and experiment with furiously"},{"support":1,"voter":"0xa8d04Cd4e1951291740Ef977d56336fDC7f394c5","numberOfVotes":5,"reason":"I agree with the sentiment that developing interest around NOC is one of the most powerful ways to proliferate the meme in these early days and that we should fund experiments around NOC."},{"support":1,"voter":"0x33DaF8e90Cd1f214CC25A1865649e847254F2ece","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0xE30585034f5e2aC9635cF94D0Fd069D6BaC2F7bC","numberOfVotes":2,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x83fCFe8Ba2FEce9578F0BbaFeD4Ebf5E915045B9","numberOfVotes":13,"reason":"great proposal. thank you for attempting this"},{"support":1,"voter":"0x9a2F6117D1FFa82ad0A2B36f133d476DB5bD55F5","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x008c84421dA5527F462886cEc43D2717B686A7e4","numberOfVotes":5,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x6f9e3976fa3b5b22761fe5D635E1f0d9d9aeB85d","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0xe085327c5AD2F77147F10973Fed45Fb19d734F7e","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x91dCCAA260CC4616E1a6e6b693DB7207C5E42937","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0xBd7Dbab9AEb52D6c8d0E80fCeBdE3af4CC86204A","numberOfVotes":6,"reason":"Sharks like NOC\nnom nom Nouns daily"},{"support":1,"voter":"0xD19BF5F0B785c6f1F6228C72A8A31C9f383a49c4","numberOfVotes":3,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0xcEb78aBFad166C11e350156fd671b385265a6C87","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":0,"voter":"0xE8D24bE3ABF6EB27B800F752A969D3C1E84fD401","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0xfC9e8dB5E255439F430e058462360Dd52b87cB4f","numberOfVotes":3,"reason":""},{"support":2,"voter":"0x5D802e2Fe48392c104Ce0401C7ECa8a4456f1F16","numberOfVotes":14,"reason":"Abstaining due to conflict, but wanted to thank 142 for spearheading this effort, and the rest of the NOC team for making The Noun Square happen every day for the past 2+ weeks.

There are 13 bridges for cars, subways, trains, and pedestrians.\n\n### Objective\n- Promote NounsDAO via online and offline engagement.\n- Get local media coverage (Invite newspaper and TV journalists)\n\n### Location: Hangang river, Seoul, South Korea\n### Date & Time: September 17-18th, 8:00 ~ 18:00\n- September 17th: Kimpo Airport→Gangnam\n- September 18th: Gangnam→Kimpo Airport\n*(The exact date and time might be changed in case of logistics delays or bad weather)*\n\n### Map\n![https://media.giphy.com/media/PS8lP8bBk0ICeuIYJE/giphy.gif](https://media.giphy.com/media/PS8lP8bBk0ICeuIYJE/giphy.gif)\n\n###  Description\n- J/24 sailboat is the most famous sailboat model of all time! I propose to display nouns glasses on 5 sailboats in the middle of Seoul, South Korea. Seoul is home to 15+ million people and a lot of interest in blockchain and NFTs among the population. The Korean government, businesses, and people are interested in blockchain and the NFT space. Hangang river is surrounded by two highways and will be a perfect place to reach many people during rush hours. The two-way distance will be around 40+ kilometers. This could be a great opportunity to advertise NounsDAO and attract potential future members and developers.\n- I know lots of sailors who want to participate in the Nouns Seoul PR campaign. I will create a fleet of five J/24 sailboats and sail along the river from Kimpo international airport to Itaewon bridge and back. This event is going to be organized for NounsDAO. There will be only 5 sailboats with spinnakers with painted Nouns Glasses logos.\n- The idea is to make as many people remember Nouns-glasses. Images of Nouns glasses on 5 sailboats in the middle of the river will spark curiosity in the minds of the bypassers. This campaign is not a spam-like poster or post that many of us learned to ignore without noticing. People would remember Nouns glasses and later when they attend a conference or buy NFTs they would recognize the Nouns symbol and would eventually come straight to the NounsDAO!\n- The spinnakers are big and span an area of 8 meters in height and 4 meters in width. After the regatta, I think the best use for sails is to give them to the sailing teams. There are about five good regattas every year in Korea, I will provide more content free of charge when we race at different events with the Nouns-themed sails. I am sure pretty spinnakers with Nouns Glasses would be appreciated by the teams and be used for many years!\n\n### Spinnaker sail designs\nI have connections to Hyde sails dealership and can place an expedited order for 5 spinnaker sails with printed logo of the nouns glasses. The Nouns glasses will be permanently spray-painted at the sail makers factory.\n\n![https://media.giphy.com/media/D1jMwyeglLc0sntg2A/giphy.gif](https://media.giphy.com/media/D1jMwyeglLc0sntg2A/giphy.gif)\n\n### Newspapers and local TV\nWe are going to send invitations to local newspapers and TV stations.

We were able to visit 3 schools, complete 355 eye exams and dispense subscriptions for 285 kids in need, delivering a total of 391 custom fitted 3D printed Fitz Frames glasses to date.\n\nWe spent a significant effort developing Noun Frames which inspired other builders and led the way for FUN Frames and Fashion Frames to move into development.\n\nHighlights & Updates: https://discord.com/channels/849745721544146955/903032675043016746/920205659675439116\n\nNouns Frames Pic|326x500, 50%\n\nhttps://vimeo.com/708413500\n\nNouns x Fitz Frames FGFK v4:\nWe want to do this again, but this time let’s do more!\n\nContinuing our partnership with Fitz Frames & partnering with various vision screening and testing providers we will deliver 3,000 Nouns X Fitz Frames Prescription Subscriptions.\n\nThe Nouns X Fitz Frames Prescription Subscription, which provides free glasses for kids if they lose them, break them, grow out of them or just desires a new pair because their style changed, will be expanded to 3K kids. Using a propriatery in-app measurement and delivery system Fitz Frames removes the need for in-person fittings and shapings that require specialized equipment and gets the perfect custom fit 3D printed glasses for kids individual face shape and personal style. Our goal is to keep kids in glasses that fit and they're proud to wear, even as they change throughout the year.\n\nExpanding the scale of this program will get us one step closer to our moon shot of creating a system where individual doctors around the world can plug in to and get free glasses for kids in need through the Nouns X Fitz Frames Prescription Subscription program.\n\nAs a pivot from a Nationwide Sponsorship for Vision To Learn we have the opportunity to work hand in hand with Sight For All United on launching a new Vision Van Program complete with a brand new van that we can collaborate together on to make it as Nounish as possible.

A Fitz Frames membership includes two complete pairs of prescription eyeglasses with unlimited replacement frames should they lose, break, grow out of the glasses, or their prescription changes.\n\nIn addition to their Fitz Frames Membership each child will receive an additional free pair of Noun Frames, glasses that mimic the pair worn by their favorite Noun.\n\nAs an initial pilot program, we propose Nouns DAO allocate 9ETH (~$30,000 worth of ETH) to provide glasses to approximately 300 kids (aprox $100) per child. This will be done with in conjunction with our outreach partner Vision to Learn in an initial focus geography (probably Ohio and/or Detroit). Progress reports will be given to NounsDAO on an ongoing basis, but no less than once a quarter. The pilot program is expected to run approximately 90 days, but children will continue to receive replacement glasses for the full year as needed. The purpose of the pilot program is to validate and refine the offering and delivery process, with the goal of expanding the efforts nationwide and eventually internationally.\n\nAt the end of the initial pilot program, Fitz present the results of the program and will put to a vote either a continuation, expansion, or termination of the program.\n\nAdditionally, we request 2ETH in one-time funding to build outreach materials (print, animation, and website) directed towards schools to explain the program, Nouns, Fitz, and the underlying technology of blockchain, NFTs, and additive manufacturing.\n\nProposal\nFitz would like to eventually build to a perpetual funding mechanism in order to expand our existing social good efforts and deliver eyewear on an ongoing basis to kids in need. In the interim, we’d like to propose a pilot program to prove out the model and refine delivery mechanism:\n\n$30K allocation from Nouns treasury to provide approximately 300 no-cost vision tests plus Fitz Frames memberships to kids in need, initially in a limited geographical focus area.\n\nFitz will provide annual memberships at cost of $100)/kid/year discounted from $185. Annual Membership consists of two pairs of custom fit glasses plus unliminted replacements.\n\nFitz will provide an additional free pair of Noun Frames, mimicking their favorite Nouns, limited to an initial selection of 10 Noun options for the Pilot Program.\n\nVision to Learn, will identify recipients and provide no-cost eye exams within the geographical focus area. Initial prospects are Ohio and Detroit.\n\nInitial Pilot Program is expected to run approximately 90 days, at which point Fitz will present a report of progress to the NounsDAO.\nAt that point the NounsDAO can vote to expand, continue, or suspend the pilot program.\n\nBased on findings from the initial Pilot Program, elements can be refined including: delivery mechanism, offering, and outreach. Additionally, Fitz Frames will work to try and secure additional underwriting in order to extend the reach of the program. (possibly through Medicaid reimbursement, or local philanthropic partners)\n\nIn order to promote the program (and help surface Nouns to a wider public awareness) we propose dedicating an additional 2ETH to develop outreach materials including print, short form animation, and a dedicated website. This will target schools, the student recipients of glasses, and broader public. In addition to promotion of the program, this is an opportunity to introduce the technology elements underpinning both Nouns and Fitz Frames, and develop age-appropriate STEM curriculum for the kids who receive the glasses.\n\nNouns is a fantastic example of people leveraging technology to come together and build long-term value in perpetuity. Fitz leverages the power of technology to change the lives of kids. We think this is a natural partnership that would not only do a tremendous amount of good, but could serve as tangible application of blockchain doing tangible good. At Fitz, we believe that those who can see the world are the ones who can change the world. NounsDAO embodies this ethos completely, and we couldn’t imagine a better partner.\n\nNoun Frames\nFitz will integrate Nouns Frames into their application so that users can pick their favorite Noun and receive glasses that mimic those frames as well as have the Noun itself printed on the side of the frames as well as the Noun number printed on the inside.\n\nAbout Fitz:\nFitz Frames: https://www.fitzframes.com/\nFitz for Good - how Fitz has worked with VTL to provide glasses for kids in the past:\nhttps://vimeo.com/377468371\nHow Fitz has worked with Healthcare community to provide protective prescription eyewear to drs and nurses across the country - https://news.yahoo.com/local-hero-nyc-glasses-maker-171104609.html\nFitz in the Press - How we came to be and why we matter to kids - https://abcnews.go.com/Business/startup-offers-affordable-eyeglasses-kids-flatter-faces/story?id=65014415\n\nAbout Vision 2 Learn:\nhttps://visiontolearn.org/about/from-the-founder/","proposer":"0xBd7Dbab9AEb52D6c8d0E80fCeBdE3af4CC86204A","startBlock":15074461,"endBlock":15094171,"executed":true},"votes":[{"support":1,"voter":"0x5D802e2Fe48392c104Ce0401C7ECa8a4456f1F16","numberOfVotes":12,"reason":"In my opinion, this proposal is the perfect example of a public good campaign that the DAO can fund without wading into the murky waters of politics and special interests.

Consequently, the idea has been spreading. From [ENS](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/pg-wg-proposal-ens-small-grants/12843), to [Ape Coin](https://twitter.com/mg/status/1532551973127561223?s=20&t=Bi66tsHPt1j7tbYBvQ9iPA) to [AAVE](https://twitter.com/HelloShreyas/status/1536867802501500928), communities across the broader crypto space have expressed interest in using Prop House.\n\nI propose building the Prop House Protocol as public infrastructure with the aims of it being a tool for all to use while proliferating the Nouns meme at the deepest level.\n\n## Where we are today:\n\n### Summary:\n\n- 300+ proposals submitted\n- 2,000+ votes allocated\n- 5 active houses\n- 157 ETH committed to 52 builders across 10 funding rounds\n- [prop.house](https://prop.house) UX continues to improve\n- External interest:\n  - [ENS](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/pg-wg-proposal-ens-small-grants/12843) building their own version of Prop House\n  - [Ape coin](https://twitter.com/mg/status/1532551973127561223?s=20&t=Bi66tsHPt1j7tbYBvQ9iPA) and [Aave](https://twitter.com/HelloShreyas/status/1536867802501500928) are amongst the 10+ communities that have expressed interest in setting up their own house\n- Please review the [Expenses report](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iKGgedZmAzMNCFkd2PqjBd-ZgutrOjuYqfirDG1wS3g/) for an overview of all things Prop House financials\n\n### Proposals:\n\nAt the time of writing (06/18), 18 proposals have had enough time elapse since being funded to make a judgement on whether or not they executed. So far, only 1 out of 18 proposals has had a no-show. Overall, quality of proposals corresponding to amounts funded are still desirable. With the launch of Nouns Combinator (25 ETH single winner house), we hope to see more ambitious proposals be submitted.\n\n### Houses:\n\nWe are currently running 4 nounish houses with another two coming online soon:\n\n- Nouns Launchpad\n- Lil Nouns\n- NounPunks\n- Nouns Combinator\n- Nouns DAO Japan _(coming soon)_\n- SharkDAO _(coming soon)_\n\nWithin the main [Nouns house](https://prop.house/nouns-launchpad), quality has stayed consistent while proposals are averaging ~38 submissions per round:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/5vpnTgd.jpg)\n\n> To view all the proposals that have been funded so far, please visit [prop.house](https://prop.house)\n\nTwo experiments were run with external houses:\n\n- Zorbs failed due to the round being endlessly spammed. Beyond the spam, there was a clear misconception in what Prop House was to be used for, hinting at more education content being needed.\n- [Mfers house](https://prop.house/mfers) has been quite a success. The [announcement tweet](https://twitter.com/nounsprophouse/status/1534967734181711880) rallied the community and the subsequent reaction points to Nouns earning goodwill as a leader in the CC0 community.\n\n## The Protocol\n\nThe protocol refers to the suite of smart contracts and open-source software that would enable anyone to run their own auctions and/or Prop House web app.\n\n### Why build the protocol in the first place?\n\nCurrently, Prop House runs as a centralized system. Each round and all of its parameters are decided on by a few people. More importantly, the Prop House multi-sig handles all the funding. As volumes grow, it increasingly becomes a risk factor.\n\nBuilding Prop House into a protocol would enable the DAO to have more control over how the capital is deployed. To illustrate, the following scenario would be possible with a live protocol:\n\n- An on-chain proposal to the DAO to set up 10 rounds at x ETH for y winners over the next 3 months\n\n### Why build it as public infrastructure?\n\nBeyond proliferating the Nouns aesthetic, I believe building public infrastructure proliferates the meme at a much deeper level hence it being the way forward.\n\n[Nouns is uniquely positioned to capture value via novel means](https://twitter.com/hongkim__/status/1533161235025260544). One of the drivers for auction demand is how aspirational the meme is. Akin to luxury goods, demand is in large part driven by psychology, not just ad spend or certain KPIs. It then follows that building public infrastructure that sets Nouns as the most forward-thinking community also contributes to auction demand.\n\nMuch more than a brand or a visual meme, Nouns is an invitation for others to join us in taking the new tools we now have at hand to rethink how we build the world around us. To that extent, public infrastructure for all is the Nounish thing to do.\n\n### To continue exploring:\n\nAlong with building the protocol, we are looking forward to:\n\n- Experimenting with bigger rounds\n- Integrating with [Snapshot](https://docs.snapshot.org/)\n- Exploring new auction formats\n  - Infinite auctions\n  - Retroactive rewards\n  - Pod and mandate specific houses\n- New nounish houses (Nouns DAO Japan, SharkDAO are coming soon)\n- Updates around the UI (past winners, voting data, etc)\n- Helping other communities onboard\n\n## Budgets\n\n### Past:\n\nTotal funded by the DAO since Dec ’21 through via proposals [23](https://nouns.wtf/vote/23) & [62](https://nouns.wtf/vote/62): - 95 ETH paying Prop House contributors (~50% still remains for Jul & Aug) - 150 ETH in funding Prop House builders\n\n### Current Ask:\n\n**Operations (600 ETH):**\n\n- 100 ETH: Adds two solidity developers to payroll for remaining 2 months (July and August)\n- 440 ETH: Extends Prop House development runway by 4 months (Sept - Dec)\n  - Team on payroll consists of 2 solidity devs, 1 backend, 1 frontend and 1 designer (solimander, vapeape, devcarrot, seneca, toastee)\n- 60 ETH: Misc expenses\n  - Smart contract audits\n  - Helping Nounish communtiies get set up (e.g. Nouns DAO Japan was ~10 ETH)\n  - Operations (infura, linear figma, etc)\n\n**Funding Builders (400 ETH):**\n\n- Capital to deploy through funding auctions. We're currently at a ~80 ETH / month rate. 400 ETH would allow for 5 months of funding across all nounish houses.\n\n**TOTAL ASK: 1000 ETH (600 PH contributors, 400 for funding builders)**\n\nWith this grant, **the funds received for one year (Dec '21 - Dec '22) of Prop House discovery and development** over the three proposals would total:\n\n- 710 ETH for funding development\n- 550 ETH for funding prop builders.\n\n## Deliverables\n\n- Suite of smart contracts that allow anyone to fund and deploy their own funding auctions\n- Open-source front-end for anyone to fork and run their own web app\n- Documentation to help developers and communities alike get started\n\n## Sustainability\n\nWe are exploring ways to make Prop House sustainable such that no future ask is required from Nouns DAO.

My name’s Kiran. I’m the founder of Verse, an autonomous NFT protocol on Ethereum. Previously, I worked on product design for PartyDAO, and in my web2 life I was a product engineer in the biotech space.\n\n### What is Verse?\n\nVerse is a protocol for autonomous NFTs on Ethereum. What does that mean? Verse enables the creation of NFTs with an embedded market that operates autonomously without the need for a central marketplace. Here’s a quick overview of how the protocol mechanism works:\n\nThrough the protocol, a creator deploys a contract Pair consisting of an ERC-20 Exchange contract and an ERC-721 Hyperobject contract. The dynamic price and supply of the ERC-20 token is managed by a bonding curve acting as an AMM. Simply, this means that anyone can buy and sell the token at any time with instant liquidity, and the contract will programmatically adjust the price based on the circulating supply. Holders of at least 1 atomic unit of the ERC-20 token can then redeem their token. Redeeming a token transfers the holder’s ERC-20 to the paired Hyperobject contract, which mints a new NFT and transfers it to the redeemer in exchange.\n\n### What is the status of Verse?\n\nThe contracts for Verse V1 are live on mainnet, and the public beta interface to interact with the protocol is live at verse.xyz. Verse V2 is currently in development, with significant UX improvements and nounish mechanisms built into the core protocol.\n\n### What can be built on Verse?\n\nThe Verse protocol represents a new medium for NFTs, and enables the creation of digital objects that have their own embedded market. Although the NFT space is still in its early infancy, we can observe some fundamental truths about the medium. Most notably, NFTs aren’t just assets or static files or jpegs. NFTs are programmable objects built to take advantage of the internet as a meme proliferation machine. In the long-term, skeuomorphic token representations like 1/1s will diminish in the market, and NFTs with programmable supply & pricing mechanisms will dominate. A significant sector of the NFT market will be represented by these types of objects, and are best suited to be exchanged via programmable markets powered by Verse. Think about it [this way](https://twitter.com/punk4156/status/1530697363714605056?s=20&t=-FFqbcGhiso88p_ZAhgOlg). Does it really make sense for a meme to exist as a static 1/1? Or does it make sense for its supply and value to dynamically change based on its demand in the market and its mindshare on the internet?\n\n### NounsDAO investment in the Verse Protocol\n\nVerse is a new NFT protocol designed to catalyze the future development of programmable internet objects. Nouns is the prototype for meme proliferation and how to build a CC0 brand that permeates the internet. Ultimately, both entities are designed to build a more composable internet in which individuals build, own, and use digital objects that accrue value as they’re integrated across the web.\n\nSpecifically, Verse V2 is incorporating mechanisms into the core protocol which seek to standardize the meme-proliferation system (programmable supply, programmable treasury controlled by NFT holders) that Nouns has pioneered. Details of the exact mechanisms will be shared closer to V2’s testnet launch.\n\nWe’re closing a funding round for Verse, and firmly believe that the protocol shouldn’t only be owned by traditional venture or finance institutions - it should have ownership from decentralized groups actively advancing and building progressive technologies in the NFT ecosystem.\n\nThus, we’d like to propose an investment from NounsDAO in the Verse protocol.\nWe think that an investment/long-term partnership would be far more powerful than a grant in that an investment incentivizes both parties (NounsDAO & Verse) to ensure that the protocol builds for long-term success, and uses the Nouns brand as a playground for innovating on new NFT mechanisms.\n\nThere’s tremendous synergy between the goals of Nouns and Verse, and a long-term partnership would entail close collaborations to build future Nouns-related NFT projects on Verse, and the ability for the DAO to have a real hand in how the protocol evolves over time.\n\n### Investment Specifics\nNounsDAO invests 175 ETH in exchange for 0.4-0.5% equity into Verse Labs (the incorporated company building the Verse protocol) with an optional token warrant. These equity figures are consistent with the current terms we have with our lead investors for our most recent funding round.\n\nA portion of the funding would go directly toward purchasing a Noun, either via the daily auction (preferred), or purchasing from an existing Nouner on secondary. I want to align the interests of Nouns x Verse as long-term as possible, and believe that by essentially exchanging ownership in the Verse protocol for representation in NounsDAO, we’d create a truly symbiotic relationship. I like to think that Nouns is building the closest thing we’ve seen to an internet city, with a distinct community, culture, and economy. Much like the way tech companies in the past decade set up shop in the bay area and saw the valley as a playground for innovation, I want Verse to have a “campus” set up in the Nouns universe, and build with the Nouns brand as a launchpad for new types of NFT distribution & exchange experiments that help proliferate the meme. The key difference, though, is that while SF never received ownership and experienced upside in the success of major silicon valley companies, Nouns would directly have ownership in Verse.\n\nLogistically, there’s a couple ways the investment could work from a compliance & regulatory perspective. For starters, I’ve created an investment DAO through syndicate.io, which allows contributions in crypto (USDC or ETH). In exchange for the investment, NounsDAO would receive a proportional amount of tokens which represent ownership in this DAO. The associated legal entity for this DAO (an LLC acting as an investment SPV) would then be part of the cap table for Verse Labs, the legal entity building the Verse protocol. The SPV would in turn own the equity. Of course, this is just one option for formalizing the investment structure, and I’m happy to work with the nounders on any alternative structure that makes sense.\n\nOverall, I’m excited to share this proposal with the Nouns community, and even more excited for the possibility to partner with the DAO on building fundamentally valuable NFT infrastructure with the Verse protocol.\n\n\n","proposer":"0xe5E4B1EC4061d6fC932207DFc5CF96bD27FB11Da","startBlock":15115558,"endBlock":15135268,"executed":true},"votes":[{"support":1,"voter":"0xe085327c5AD2F77147F10973Fed45Fb19d734F7e","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":2,"voter":"0xD19BF5F0B785c6f1F6228C72A8A31C9f383a49c4","numberOfVotes":3,"reason":""},{"support":0,"voter":"0x5ca6a2e5f53a48616d4ead87fF6034fc032D4722","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":"this isn't nounish at all"},{"support":2,"voter":"0xcC2688350d29623E2A0844Cc8885F9050F0f6Ed5","numberOfVotes":12,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0xAca3b4110403F3c4dacb35A7B3Aa0a84eFb6A3e9","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":2,"voter":"0xcEb78aBFad166C11e350156fd671b385265a6C87","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":"I like the concept, the idea of Nouns owning equity in a company building web3 infra and said company then buying a Noun.\n\nHowever, I abstain since I'd like to know and see more about Verse V2 and for the DAO to have a broader discussion about owning equity and its possible implications.

Churn is bad\n  * Steep learning curve for new contributors to meaningfully contribute\n  * Contributor value grows over time, but there is less incentive to stay once they are experts\n\n# Protocol Guild\n\nThrough a lot of discussion and iteration, the **Protocol Guild** was formed: a collective of protocol contributors which actively maintains an onchain registry of its membership.\n\nIn response to the challenges above, the org was designed to carry out specific activities:\n\n1. Self-curate an onchain registry of individuals\n  * Sponsors only need to know a single contract address instead of many separate team addresses, they can trust that there is quality backing it\n  * Members now have a single mechanism to coordinate around and solicit sponsorships to\n  * Domain expert members can surface part time contribs or lower profile collaborators which may be missed by other existing mechanisms\n2. Solicit sponsorships to balance financial incentives\n  * Bootstrap with high profile DAO treasuries\n  * Longterm, build norms around pre-allocation of a % of initial token supply\n3. Incentivize long-term contributions\n  * 6 month min before eligibility\n  * Vesting gets people to stick around\n  * Time weighted allocations to recognize the importance of long term contributors\n\nTo date, the membership includes over [110 Ethereum protocol contributors](https://protocol-guild.readthedocs.io/en/latest/9-membership.html), including researchers, client maintainers, upgrade coordinators, tooling maintainers. This is a broad-based ecosystem effort: members come from 22 different teams and 9 organizations. Only 40% of members are directly employed by the EF. The membership is continuously curated through quarterly updates to the split contract - we expect the membership to grow over the next year.\n\nThe Guild contracts are an autonomous value routing mechanism, operated independently from any existing institution, purpose-built for incentivizing long-term core protocol work. At no point does PG take custody of funds on behalf of members, it is all handled trustlessly. Learn more about the smart contracts we are using for the Pilot [here](https://protocol-guild.readthedocs.io/en/latest/3-smart-contract.html).\n\n# 2022 Pilot\n\nSince starting the project in Nov 2021, we’ve built norms around member onboarding , refined the splitting and vesting mechanisms, and created extensive documentation on how it should be operated.\n\nWe’ve kicked off a test of the mechanism’s efficacy with a 1 year / $10mm Pilot. So far, we’ve raised $5.4mm (as of June 28 2022) from a number of notable communities, including:\n\n* [2mm LDO from the Lido community](https://research.lido.fi/t/proposal-to-fund-the-protocol-guild-pilot-via-a-lido-grant/2016)\n* [200k ENS from the ENS community](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/ep13-executable-support-the-protocol-guild-pilot/12877)\n* [500k UNI from the Uniswap community](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/governance-proposal-should-the-uniswap-community-participate-in-the-protocol-guild-pilot/16824)\n\nSecured funding can be tracked onchain through the [Pilot vesting contract](https://app.0xsplits.xyz/accounts/0xF29Ff96aaEa6C9A1fBa851f74737f3c069d4f1a9/). We are currently engaging with a number of other notable projects to secure the remainder of the $10mm target.\n\n# Proposal\n\nWe are inviting the Nouns community to contribute 500 ETH (2% of the treasury) to the 1 year Pilot vesting contract deployed at [theprotocolguild.eth](https://app.0xsplits.xyz/accounts/0xF29Ff96aaEa6C9A1fBa851f74737f3c069d4f1a9/) (0xF29…f1a9).\n\nThe ETH will vest to each beneficiary members listed on the underlying split at [0x84af…8ea1](https://app.0xsplits.xyz/accounts/0x84af3D5824F0390b9510440B6ABB5CC02BB68ea1/). Each recipient will make an independent decision about how to use the ETH once vested.\n\nThere are a few reasons why supporting the Protocol Guild Pilot benefits the Nouns community:\n\n* Nouns’ long-term success is tightly coupled with the continued evolution and maintenance of the Ethereum protocol. These are projects that often have multi-year timelines:\n  * [The Merge](https://github.com/ethereum/pm/blob/master/Merge/mainnet-readiness.md): moving from PoW to PoS, increasing security and sustainability\n  * EVM improvements: new functionality for application developers like [EOF](https://notes.ethereum.org/@ipsilon/evm-object-format-overview)\n  * [Statelessness](https://notes.ethereum.org/@gballet/Sy-a6T5St): sustainable management for state growth as the network scales\n  * Supporting Layer 2 scaling: [EIP-4844](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4844), [EIP-4488](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4488)\n  * [Proposer Builder Separation](https://notes.ethereum.org/@vbuterin/pbs_censorship_resistance): reducing centralizing incentives for consensus participants\n  * Continuous client maintenance: improving sync, exploring new database types, researching and improving modular clients\n  * Coordinating network upgrades: making sure the community helps to shape and is aware of network upgrades\n* Pilot participation introduces a new facet for Nouns as a public goods funder\n* Early support of a new mechanism recognizes another “fellow traveler” pushing the boundaries of incentive frameworks\n* Diverse funding sources from the community further decentralizes protocol governance and prevents influence from pooling with any single entity\n\nWe hope that a successful Pilot will pave the way for future funding collaborations between Nouns and the Protocol Guild as we scale up. To that end, we think it’s important to demonstrate impact before we scale: learn more about how we will evaluate [Pilot outcomes here](https://protocol-guild.readthedocs.io/en/latest/5-initial-pilot.html). We want to make sure the mechanism operates smoothly before graduating to a full-scale fundraising round with longer vesting periods.","proposer":"0x4C0a466DF0628FE8699051b3Ac6506653191cc21","startBlock":15129250,"endBlock":15148960,"executed":true},"votes":[{"support":1,"voter":"0x5C6E1B0e60d4a1493ca8DD9Bbf7a31d65Eeec094","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":"Ethereum is the land on which Nouns is built on.

Our goal is to create a cut and sewn Nouns clothing line to seed through public channels with the intention of building brand familiarity outside of web3.\n\nThe team behind Nouns Brand is highly experienced in web3 and fashion. Among other things, we recently created the [Creature World x Advisry](https://twitter.com/creatureworld/status/1477758094667100161?s=20&t=yli7rD42olxZUdtHNwnQjA) clothing collection.\n\n**Total Ask: 355Ξ**\n\n### Video Pitch\n[![Hello](https://i.imgur.com/9kWmKUO.png)](https://streamable.com/oui7m1/) \n([Alternative link to video](https://streamable.com/oui7m1))\n\n---\n# Why Nouns Brand?\n⌐◨-◨ is the full stack of web3 with a dash of magic. Nouns implies quality and creativity, but also carries a whiff of mass culture which has the potential to turn the noses of consumers outside of the know.\n\nFrom a business perspective, the full-speed push into tasteful clothing that pulls from Nouns imagery is a logical step forward. What is cc0 without encouraging designers and artists the freedom to take Nouns creative assets and explore? *The next generation of artists will wear Nouns.*\n\n### Proposal\n**Fund Nouns Brand ⌐◨-◨ to**:\n- design, manufacture, and produce artisanal garments (entirely **cut & sew**, *not* plug and play)\n- open a channel of collaboration between legacy brands and Nouns\n- seed Nouns clothing via PR, publications, and marketing media\n\n**How does it benefit the DAO?**\n- For the cost of ~3.5 days of auctions, we can add a creative vertical to Nouns that expands the audience and inspires future builders. Nouns esports(*jersey/tracksuit concept in bottom left corner of mockup*)  is an unexpected vertical that has already onboarded enough people to return a multiple of the funding amount to the DAO. \n- Entire collection **free for Noun holders** (1-time use code, 1 free item per style), **forever**.\n\n![tagmockup](https://i.imgur.com/ahYiWq2.png)\n---\n\n# Development\n### Pre-Production  (1-2 months)\n- Design Phase -* work *with designers to produce unique designs, prints, and patterns\n- Creation of tech-packs\n- Pattern Making / Size Grading - work with top pattern makers within NYC to create intricate, functional garments.\n- Muslin Fittings - use patterns to develop a muslin of the garments that could be used for fit tests on models of different sizes to ensure each measurement is perfect before production with our actual fabrics begin.\n- Fabric Sourcing - work within the Garment District to find quality wholesale and deadstock fabrics to use for each individual muslin fitted garment. Develop custom fabrics owned and used by Nouns Brand.\n- **Consult Gremplin, the Nounders, and any relevant parties to finalize designs that feel truly Nounish.**\n- Acquire samples and reach quality assurance.\n\n### Production (2-4 months)\n- Engage factories in Italy, Japan, Portugal, China, and/or India.\n\n### Post-Production\n- Shoot lookbooks and editorial imagery while bulk order is produced.\n- Release collection in conjunction with PR coverage, lookbook release, and wildpasting campaign\n- Custom online storefront\n    - We will engage web teams who have worked with [Drake](https://drakerelated.com/#front), [A$AP Rocky](https://muse.place/), and [Creature World](https://creature.world/) in order to produce a unique user experience when shopping with Nouns\n- International fulfillment center for shipment and inventory management\n    - Free shipping worldwide for **every** order\n    - Nouns holders and delegates receive 1 size/style of every item for free.\n\n---\n# Outreach\n### Advertising\n- Wheat-posters\n    - Printing and posting wheat-posters around NYC, Miami, LA, Hong Kong, London using teams who handle campaigns for Supreme, Nordstrom, Ray Bans, etc.\n    - We have assisted Nounish friends such as Vector DAO, Nouns Coffee, and others in sourcing wild pasting campaigns in major NYC neighborhoods\n\n### Marketing + PR\n- Hiring of PR agencies such as Orienteer or Gia Kuan agency to facilitate and catapult expansion of Nouns brand, basics, lifestyle products, etc.\n    - Editorial write ups (our previous work has been featured in GQ, Forbes, and Vogue without PR representation)\n    - Product Seeding\n    - Publicity\n    - Stockists (being carried in retail stores such as Uniqlo, Kith, Dover Street Market, etc.)\n\n### Marketing Materials\n- Editorials\n- Lookbook\n- Product Photos\n\n---\n# Costs\n\n### Pre-Production (100Ξ)\n\n**Design Fee and Materials**\nDesign, pattern-making, cost of fabrics, and labor costs.\n\n**Sampling Costs**\nRoughly $1,000-3,000 USD per style (factories charge premium to fulfill small shipments and require a minimum of pieces ordered when testing a new product, such as a custom nouns belt, which we’ve been quoted at $1,700 to get the minimum amount of samples made for 3 belt color ways.)\n\n### Production (180Ξ)\n*This is an estimate of our expected costs to produce, ship, and store a wholesale order of products.*\n\n### Post-Production (75Ξ)\n**Product photos (total ~$7,000)**\nPhotographer ($3,000)\nRetouching ($1,200)\nStudio ($800)\nCrew ($1,700)\nFood ($100)\nTravel ($100)\n\n**Campaign/Lookbook (total ~$25,000)**\nPhotographer ($5,000)\nModels ($800-1,200 per)\nLocation/Travel ($1,000-3,000)\nEditing and film development ($1,500-2,000)\nCrew ($6,000)\nPrep day — styling, rentals, labor (usually 1/3 of crew budget, $2,000)\nWheatpasting ($3,000)\n\n**PR (~$15,000)**\nA typical quality PR agency charges 3,000-10,000/month and requires a minimum engagement period, usually 3 months.\n\n**Staffing ($30,000)**\nFor hiring crew to handle shipping, fulfillment, inventory, and customer service for 4 months\n\n### Total Ask: 355Ξ\n\n---\n# Future of Nouns Brand\n*This section contains our vision for what the future of Nouns Brand could be and is **outside the scope** of this prop.*\n\nFashion is gatekept, we believe art is for everyone. To encourage others to start their own creative journeys, our dream is to create a direct-to-consumer white label service for artists to make their own clothes through Nouns Brand. We will use Nouns Blanks to allow people to print designs and empower people to create, built on Nouns.\n\n### Collaborations\n**Nouns Brand can be a channel for collaboration as companies seek partners in bridging the gaps of the sacred and profane: web2 and web3.** \n\nWork with aligning companies we have relationships with to create limited collaborations with Nouns through Nouns Brand, our wish list includes:\n- Nouns Esports - gaming (jersey design and partnerships with Gunnar Optics, G Fuel, etc.)\n- Gucci - fashion\n- Carrots - streetwear\n- Adidas - fashion/footwear\n- Dr Martens - footwear\n- Crocs - footwear\n- Swatch, Casio - watches\n- Tiffany & Co - jewelry\n- Rimowa - luggage\n- Ikea - furniture\n\n### Direct-To-Consumer White Label Service\n- We will wholesale our Nouns Brand blanks and develop a white label service for emerging artists to create their own clothes\n- Nouns White Label Facility\n- Custom color ways of Nouns blanks: Nouns Dye House\n- Team of print and embroidery specialists to customize Nouns blanks, such as t-shirts, hoodies, hats, etc.\n    - Blanks are made to supply the clothing industry. Blank clothing has no added decoration. Many clothing \"labels\" begin with a good blank, add their own logos, designs or trimmings, re-label and on-sell to retailers, or sell direct at markets, online, etc.\n- DTG Print & Embroidery Machines\n- White Label Fulfillment Team\n- Wholesale Blank Accounts\n\n### The Nounge (Shop)\nWe envision a Nouns brick and mortar store, the Nounge, in the Soho neighborhood of New York City. An experiential Nouns Brand space to shop and serve as a storefront for collaboration activations. The Nounge will also serve as the premiere carrier for Nouns Coffee in NY.\n\n- Brick-and-mortar shop\n- Activation site for brand collaborations and events\n- Accepts Fiat and Crypto as payment method\n- Photography Studio for emerging Nouns projects\n\n---\n# Team\n**Keith -** owner and creative director of Advisry.

With just one month of scheduling time, NounsOTG was able to plan, coordinate and complete its first multi-day activation at NFT.NYC, resulting in some planned and some unexpected exposure for the [Nouns](https://www.nouns.wtf) brand at one of the leading industry events of the year.\n\n![NFT NYC](https://imgur.com/tLh2n5Z.png)\n\n### Key Moments From This Activation\n\n - Activations inside the NFT.NYC event all three days at the different event locations\n - Gnars event in Time Square where we met other nounish projects\n - Filmed at the Noun mural with the nounish film crew / [Proposal 64](https://nouns.wtf/vote/64)\n - Unexpected/surprise filming with Shopify putting NounsDAO in their official NFT video\n - In-studio filming with Stoopid Buddy / [Proposal 73](https://nouns.wtf/vote/73)\n - Sandbox event at Gotham Hall, introduced Andy Milonakis to Nouns and the different forks\n - Noun O’Clock meetups IRL / On-site hosting\n - Met notable NFT musicians and began conversation that led to a feature performance by a #1 musician in the Noun O’Clock space\n - Connected with other nounish builders and people from Prop.House\n\n![NFT NYC](https://imgur.com/gWur0ZO.png)\n\n### Clear Takeaways From This Activation\n - IRL is important to solidify proliferation of the Nouns\n - IRL invites unexpected growth opportunities for Nouns\n - “On The Ground” promotion is an effective decentralized marketing tool\n - IRL brand recognition creates authentic and memorable user connection\n\n![Shopify Ad](https://imgur.com/d4v1R97.png)\n\n## WHAT’S NEXT? ⌐◐-◐\n\nMore events, more proliferation and more recognition! **Nouns On The Ground** wants to replicate and scale the success of NFT.NYC for the Nouns, by targeting 4 other major key hubs for future Nouners and Nounish builders. To clarify, **Nouns On The Ground** will be working to replicate the ROI and general recognition of the NFT.NYC activation. Flexible “on the ground” event planning is an important element, keeping the process decentralized, new and always changing. The goal of The **Proliferation Pod** will be to create new and unique experiences catered to each event.\n\nThe **Proliferation Pod** will manage the Proposal amount to cover the costs of these events. ETH funding will need to be converted to USD to cover travel costs, merch/swag orders and other event related fees. The same budget used for the NFT.NYC event, which was 6 ETH, totals to 11 ETH today to adjust for the change in ETH price since initial funding. **Nouns On The Ground** can replicate these activations for the same amount as previously proven in New York with a slight added cost for travel for NFT London.\n\n![IRL Events](https://imgur.com/uJYIXYl.png)\n\n### NFT3 AWARDS (August 5-7) in Los Angeles, CA (11 ETH)\n\nA unique event that has started garnering attention from musicians and artists utilizing NFTs. The NFT3 Awards in Los Angeles and will have over 16,000 attendees which is roughly the same size as NFT.NYC. The NFT3 Awards will be the premiere NFT summer event on the West Coast. Nouns On The Ground will immediately begin planning this next activation. This will create consistency throughout the US NFT markets, as the Nouns meme continues to spread across the world in Rio, Sweden, Tokyo and more.\n\nI will have swag and merch on hand for “ Noggle recognition awards”, multiple hidden AR POAP dispensers for event POAP collecting and of course, more stickers and buttons with 10 newly featured Nouns to hit the ground. DM if you want your Noun featured this time! I will continue to post updates in this thread as we get closer to the event.\n\n### NOUNS DOTA FINALS (August 10-14) in Arlington, TX (11 ETH)\n\nThe currently undefeated NOUNS DOTA team is a guarantee for the Finals. We need Nouns On The Ground to proliferate Nouns throughout the stadium, amongst the Nouns fans and entire audience. We’ve started throwing around the idea of Noggle sports towels. Nouns On The Ground is in the NounsEsports Discord and ready to coordinate other live events to bring well deserved attention to this highly successful NounsDAO Proposal. This would be the best event of the 5 for a big T-shirt order as well.\n\n### NFT NASHVILLE (September 1-5) in Nashville, TN (11 ETH)\n\nNFT Nashville is striving to be the premiere NFT music event of the South as it brings a “festival-like” NFT event to the heart of the music capital during the Labor Day weekend. Some of the top current NFT music artists, including Sammy Ariaga, call Nashville home and have set the tone for NFT Nashville to enter the music scene with a bang. After starting through local meet-ups, NFT Nashville has quickly set a precedent for community building within this industry and the presence of the Nouns is necessary for proliferation.\n\n### NFT LONDON (November 6-7) in London, United Kingdom (18 ETH)\n\nNFT.London is being organized by the same team behind NFT.NYC, so you can already guarantee this will be one of Europe’s main NFT events of the year. With people already tweeting about grabbing tickets to this event, it is a no brainer to have Nouns fully on the ground in the UK. There is a slight increase in the funding cost for this event to account for additional travel costs.\n\n### ART BASEL MIAMI BEACH (December 1-4) in Miami, FL (11 ETH)\n\nArt Basel is another fantastic event for NFTs and proliferation of the Nouns Brand. Last year’s event in Miami Beach was the launchpad for some of the largest brands currently in the industry. This event is known for setting art trends and the Nouns meme needs to be logged in event attendee memories to close out the year in a strong way.\n\n### NOUNS ON THE GROUND OPERATION COSTS (18 ETH)\n\nWhy choose Aubtoshi and Nouns On The Ground for these events? I have a proven successful track record with this type of proliferation and have modeled my plans for each of these 4 events after the successful New York multi-day activation. The job will get done with added elements of surprise and key events that always arise when engaging IRL. I am also involved with multiple Nounish projects that also seek to proliferate the Nouns brand and have incorporated these projects during my activations as well.\n\n[Prop House Proposal Round 1](https://prop.house/proposal/41) / [Prop House Proposal Round 2](https://prop.house/proposal/71) / [Prop House Proposal Round 3](https://prop.house/proposal/117) / [Small Grants Proposal](https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/nouns-on-the-ground-nft-nyc-activation/1215/3) (funded 6 ETH) / [Lost Nouns - Noun O’Talk S:1 EP:15](https://twitter.com/cdt_eth/status/1542260980046073856?s=20&t=-z9THGWZCxf2o4oAfNSosg) / [Noun O’Clock Spaces with Noun Square](https://twitter.com/noun_o_clock/status/1544475669266038787?s=20&t=-z9THGWZCxf2o4oAfNSosg) / [Nouns News Proposal w/Aubtoshi Avatar](https://prop.house/proposal/598)\n\n![Noun Prop House and Events](https://imgur.com/ehY6m08.png)\n![Twitter Spaces and Nounish News](https://imgur.com/qA2e2mv.png)\n\n\nNounsDAO funding Nouns On The Ground to operate in this fashion will allow this proven project to grow and scale without having to come to the DAO per each event. Proliferating the Nouns is the goal. I would love for NounsDAO to continue to let me show you the wonderful, creative and unexpected ways we can do just that, on the ground, IRL!\n\n## TOTAL PROPOSAL ASK: 92 ETH ($110,400) over 6 months ⌐Ξ-Ξ\n***ETH calculated at 1 ETH = $1,200 USD**\n***15% added for volatility w/any extra being sent back to NounsDAO**\n\nInstead of having multiple proposals for each event as they come, this one proposal will cover the costs of these events planned within a 6 month period. The amount will be held in a multi-sig wallet, in USD, that will release funds in the following manner:\n\n\n**IMMEDIATE** - Initial release for Event 1 & Event 1.5 & Op: 25 ETH ($30,000 USD)\n08/01/22 - Release for Event 2 & Op: 14 ETH ($16,800 USD)\n09/01/22 - Release for Event 3 & Op: 21 ETH ($25,200 USD)\n10/01/22 - Release for Event 4 & Op: 14 ETH ($16,800 USD)\n11/01/22 - Release for Op: 3 ETH ($3,600 USD)\n12/01/22 - Release for Op: 3 ETH ($3,600 USD)\n**Total: 80 ETH ($96,000 USD)** distributed through 6 transactions over the course of 6 months (July 2022-Dec 2022) as outlined above\n\nAt the suggestion made by Seneca above, we have added 15% to account for volatility:\n\n15% Increase added for volatility to 80 ETH = 12 ETH ($14,400)\nTotal ETH ask including 15% increase for volatility = 92 ETH\nTotal USD ask including 15% increase for volatility = $110,400 USD\n\n**PLEASE NOTE:** All ETH not used strictly for reasons relating to volatility in ETH price will be sent back to the NounsDAO from the multi-sig wallet.\n\nThere will be 3 individuals for the 2/3 signers verification to ensure proper distribution of funds on the correct date. \n\n**Signer 1**: Aubtoshi\n**Signer 2**: 142\n**Signer 3**: Seneca\n\n![Dominoe Effect](https://imgur.com/ctVSkv9.png)\n\n\nAn additional part of the overall success of Nouns On The Ground Proliferation Pod will come through collaboration with other Nounish builders. Please reach out via [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/NounsOTG) or Discord (aubtoshi#9612) to talk all things collab!\n\n## LONG-TERM “NOUNISH” GOALS ⌐◪-◪\nThis experimental Proliferation Pod is the next clear step for Nouns On The Ground as an appropriate scaling measure. Aubtoshi isn’t going anywhere and will continue to bring value to this community. A personal long-term goal is to be a woman Nouner. Until I have the opportunity to join the community as an official Nouner, I will continue to proliferate the Nouns in the most fun and effective ways that I can make possible. Thank you Nouners for giving me this chance to show you what we can do together, On The Ground! \n\n![Aubtoshi!](https://imgur.com/X5mwdw0.png)\n\n\n**Multi-sig Wallet Address to send ETH**: 0x5b35c3EF0acF9660a7d3fcefc2A2053a7CEC20E3\n","proposer":"0xce6404642bB08f897FCe5317C1349656ca44f2D8","startBlock":15137191,"endBlock":15156901,"executed":true},"votes":[{"support":1,"voter":"0xa555d1Ee16780B2d414eD97f4f169c0740099615","numberOfVotes":2,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x87757c7fD54D892176e9ECEc6767Bc16e04a06a8","numberOfVotes":3,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x5ca6a2e5f53a48616d4ead87fF6034fc032D4722","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":"aubtoshi once helped this fuzzy man smash a papaya he was having trouble eating and for that reason i am an aubtoshi maximalist - free bananas!"},{"support":1,"voter":"0x4754b7e3DEde42D71d6c92978f25F306176EC7e9","numberOfVotes":25,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x2e32935bfD5B2718f99BC8FDf8B37c16811f7D97","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0xA86882277E69FbF0a51805cdc8b0a3a113079E63","numberOfVotes":4,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x73222225044cE0FC672Ff9b6F9730D0a0421382C","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":"Aubtoshi maximalism "},{"support":1,"voter":"0x75Ee6eb3d8DAcf41eE2e5307090B197D3E1Cca6E","numberOfVotes":12,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x008c84421dA5527F462886cEc43D2717B686A7e4","numberOfVotes":5,"reason":"Voting for a high energy force of nature"},{"support":1,"voter":"0x6f9e3976fa3b5b22761fe5D635E1f0d9d9aeB85d","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x83fCFe8Ba2FEce9578F0BbaFeD4Ebf5E915045B9","numberOfVotes":14,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0xa8d04Cd4e1951291740Ef977d56336fDC7f394c5","numberOfVotes":5,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0xD19BF5F0B785c6f1F6228C72A8A31C9f383a49c4","numberOfVotes":3,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x5D802e2Fe48392c104Ce0401C7ECa8a4456f1F16","numberOfVotes":11,"reason":"I have had the pleasure of seeing Aubtoshi's Nounish passion grow from Day One when she pitched her first Nouns of the Ground proposal on our very first Prop House Weekly Spaces.

As the DAO has grown, incoming inquiry has scaled with it.  Running SG is what I spend most of my time on every day.  The group does not presently have an operational budget, and my compensation for this work is included as part of my role as Core Contributor. \n\nI'm very proud of what has been accomplished so far at SG.  The group has funded many builders and projects (detailed below) that have generated tremendous value for the DAO.  Many of the DAO's most successful proposals started as a trial sponsored by SG, and many of the DAO's most valuable community members were funded/onboarded by SG when they first joined the community.  In my experience running SG for the better part of a year, I have seen many instances in which a 1 ETH grant can generate more value to the DAO than an 100+ ETH proposal.  The crypto ecosystem is rife with rugs and scams, and that is precisely why our generosity on the individual level leaves such a lasting impression and inspires such fierce loyalty.\n\nToday, SG serves multiple roles for the DAO: we are the DAO's working capital, a Nounish venture pod, and an onboarding tool. SG has the flexibility to quickly:\n* Fund exciting smaller proposals (in concert with Prop House)\n* Vet new builders and derisk new projects by funding trials ahead of sponsoring larger on-chain proposals\n* Be a first point of contact and source of funding to onboard new community members \n* Retroactively reward builders \n* Provide time-sensitive and milestone based funding as a part of larger proposals\n* Fill other ad hoc daily capital needs of the DAO (contests, bug bounties, etc)\n\nMy daily work on SG includes:\n* Engaging with community members that request funding\n* Providing feedback on and tracking multiple proposals\n* Monitoring and responding to new inquiry over Discord and [Discourse](https://discourse.nouns.wtf/u/noun22/activity)\n* Diligencing proposals to prevent waste and fraud\n* Negotiating funding terms\n* Following up with funded builders\n* Building a relationship with new builders and onboarding them deeper into the Nouns ecosystem\n* Administrative tasks  \n\nI conduct the majority of SG's operations on [Discourse](https://discourse.nouns.wtf/u/noun22/activity) and in the `#grants-and-retro-funding` channel in the Nouns DAO Discord.  \n\nSince inception, SG has funded 100+ builders with over 230 ETH.  [This link contains information on everything SG has funded to date](https://noun22.notion.site/noun22/Nouns-DAO-Small-Grants-ac22114a6c004bafa500e2d824e32dc3).

Community Building: Onboarding New Nouners / Weekly Calls**\n\nSince I first joined the DAO a year ago, I have reached out to every new member to organize an onboarding call.  To date, I have done over 100+ of these calls.  If you are voting this proposal, we have likely had one of these calls - if we haven't please reach out to me on Discord!\n\nAdditionally, I host the weekly [US Nouner Town Hall call every Tuesday at 5:30pm ET](https://hackmd.io/@noun22/nounweekly).  The call initially started as an informal meet and greet where we first got the opportunity to hear each other's voices and get to know each other, and has evolved into a more structured format where we discuss and form consensus on topical issues.  \n\nI host these calls not just to meet and build relationships with fascinating, cool, like-minded people, but I view them as integral to creating and strengthening a sense of community within the DAO.\n\nNouns is the most exciting and innovative project in crypto, but we cannot become complacent and view our success as inevitable.  The DAO's greatest long term threat is member apathy and disengagement - particularly as we have entered into what may be a lasting crypto bear market.  Members who feel lost or confused will quickly become inactive members, and the DAO will suffer as a result.\n\nI will continue to use my experience in the role to foster an atmosphere of open communication and experimentation where every community member feels they are able to contribute to the DAO.  Everyone needs to feel that their opinions are heard and their proposal ideas are fairly considered.  In my role, I try and be a neutral go-between and source of feedback to maintain harmony within the DAO.  \n\nMy involvement with Nouns has been the absolute high point of my career.  I have never felt this level of excitement and optimism about my work.  Thanks for reading this, and I look forward to continuing to Nounify The World with you all ⌐◨-◨\n\n\n### Compensation\nBeing a Core Contributor for Nouns DAO is a unique role within a unique organization.  I hope this proposal has demonstrated the value I have generated for Nouns DAO, my passion for this organization, and convinced you of why I am uniquely suited to continue in this role going foward.\n\nThe nominal $ value of my last contract with the DAO was $32k per month for 6 months.  For this contract I propose an extension at the same nominal $ rate:\n* 6 month term\n* Nominal $32k per month paid in USDC\n* Nouns DAO can vote to cancel the contract at any point\n* ETH to be sent to the SG multi-sig address and a portion will converted to USDC upon receipt\n* Funds will be put into a Sablier contract that commences on August 25 2022 with a 6 month duration","proposer":"0x75Ee6eb3d8DAcf41eE2e5307090B197D3E1Cca6E","startBlock":15141388,"endBlock":15161098,"executed":true},"votes":[{"support":1,"voter":"0xA4c8d9e4Ec5f2831701A81389465498B83f9457d","numberOfVotes":3,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x008c84421dA5527F462886cEc43D2717B686A7e4","numberOfVotes":5,"reason":"Integral and connective work"},{"support":1,"voter":"0xA86882277E69FbF0a51805cdc8b0a3a113079E63","numberOfVotes":4,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x75Ee6eb3d8DAcf41eE2e5307090B197D3E1Cca6E","numberOfVotes":13,"reason":"🧟‍♂️"},{"support":1,"voter":"0x17bEaA158E68FF9225b4c85151831C7a0D8F258D","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x6f9e3976fa3b5b22761fe5D635E1f0d9d9aeB85d","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x5ca6a2e5f53a48616d4ead87fF6034fc032D4722","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x4754b7e3DEde42D71d6c92978f25F306176EC7e9","numberOfVotes":25,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0xa8d04Cd4e1951291740Ef977d56336fDC7f394c5","numberOfVotes":5,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0xD19BF5F0B785c6f1F6228C72A8A31C9f383a49c4","numberOfVotes":3,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x5D802e2Fe48392c104Ce0401C7ECa8a4456f1F16","numberOfVotes":11,"reason":"DAOs are powered by people.

Noun22 is a person who has does a lot of important core work for the DAO and would be impossible to easily replace. Incentivizing people like him to continue building here is important, so I support his Proposal for this reason. I also think there is lots of opportunity for ongoing DAO tasks to be put into buckets and bid on using Prop House tech in future, to increase decentralization and longterm sustainability, but these two things are not mutually exclusive, and we will nonetheless always need passionate core contributors to drive growth.

Extending the signing of our Dota roster until after [The International](https://liquipedia.net/dota2/The_International) in October, with the mission to proliferate Nouns through esports competition.\n\n### Description\n\n[Nouns Esports](https://twitter.com/nounsesports) was founded with the passing of [Proposal 68](https://nouns.wtf/vote/68), which brought a Professional Dota team under the Nouns banner. They won a large North American tournament and currently have a 6-1 standing in the Dota Pro Circuit \"DPC\" - the most important qualifier matches leading to the biggest tournament in the world, [The International](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_International_(Dota_2)). \n\nThe teams' current term with the DAO will end on July 17th, after the DPC. Because of their DPC standing, they currently have a strong probability of attending the upcoming Arlington Major in August. Since our current proposal ends before this event, it makes sense to extend their term with the DAO. Their success in the rest of the DPC and the Major will determine if they qualify directly to The International.\n\nIf you want to learn more about Prop #68, an [accountability report](https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/proposal-nouns-esports-pod/1030/5) was posted detailing how funds from the proposal were spent.\n\n### Timeline of Upcoming Potential Competitive Events:\n![](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/nouns/original/2X/b/bf4ae929b0d0a31086dc5ffaf3d40c355c4a17ec.png)\n\n\nJuly 17th - Prop #68 Ends\nJuly 16th-August 19th - Thunderpick Bitcoin Series TBS\nTBD July 17th-20th - Potential DPC Tiebreakers\nJuly 28th-30th - ESL Malaysia Qualifiers \nAugust 04-14th - Arlington Major\nAugust 23rd-28th - ESL Malaysia\nTBD likely September - The International Regional Qualifiers\nOct 15-30 - The International\nNovember 1st - Proposal Ends\n\n### Budget: 119,633 DAI / 99.6942 ETH (at $1200)\n* Salaries: ETH converted to DAI and distributed on a monthly basis as the team continues to represent Nouns in competition.\n    * Players + Coach Salaries: 60 ETH (estimated 72000 DAI)\n        * Split evenly amongst the players and coach.\n    * Support Staff: 20 ETH (estimated 24000 DAI)\n        * This includes social media support, design work, organizing practice, video content, organizing travel to events and to the bootcamp, player media appearance logistics, and strategically working with other Nouns infrastructure.\n* Bootcamp: 15 ETH (estimated 18000 DAI)\n    * This bootcamp fund will be deployed pending a successful qualification for an international event (ESL Malaysia, The International, etc.).\n* Builder Comp - 4.6942 ETH (estimated 5333 DAI)\n    - Sasquatch took no compensation per the [accountability report](https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/proposal-nouns-esports-pod/1030/5) \n    - Organizing this project - shipping both props, operating the multi-sig, managing esports operations, and acting as a liaison between the team and Nouns DAO.\n\nWe are also adding 30 ETH to our on-chain ask in order to account for ETH/DAI volatility.

While not yet guaranteed, they have positioned themselves to have an excellent shot at attending the upcoming Major in Arlington, Texas.\n    - During this signing, past potentially competing in the Major they will have an opportunity to compete in the ESL Malaysia qualifiers, and qualifiers for The International. \n- Tournament Stream Viewership\n    - Tournament matches during the pilot have regularly received between 10,000 and 40,000 viewers. If the team qualifies for any of the upcoming international events, viewership will be a few multiples higher.\n        - The International 2021 had [2,700,000 peak viewers](https://escharts.com/events/international), excluding China.\n- Individual Stream Viewership\n    - Players individually stream and regularly present the Nouns brand on stream\n        - Our player Gunnar has been the most active streamer regularly getting a [few thousand viewers.](https://twitchtracker.com/gunnardota2)\n- In-game Branding\n    - Dota allows for DPC teams to have in-game branding through assets placed inside of the game's landscape.

Allow us to introduce ourselves…\n\n[![Ordinary Folk Reel](https://i.imgur.com/LV2e5A7.png)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1M7osmhGv5v4HIvtN321pnJa1EXrdTY4J/view?)\n\n💻 You can see more of our work [here](http://www.ordinaryfolk.co/work).\n \n\nWe’re a big fan of NFTs and explaining complex ideas — simply and beautifully. We’ve been doing it for a while with companies you may have heard of, and we’d like to do it for you.\n\n# Proposal\n\nWe propose commissioning Ordinary Folk to create a 1-2 minute fully animated video. Explaining Nouns, how they work and why the community is so valuable.\n\n# But, why?\n\nWe know Nouns are awesome, but scrolling through all this? \n\nNot so awesome.\n\n![webNavGIF](https://media.giphy.com/media/YwFuI4outa3r6PYdlj/giphy.gif)\n\nA much better way to go through this information is with an animated explainer. Sure, we're biased, but the facts remain that explainers have the power to communicate complex and vast amounts of information in a short and entertaining way.\n\nWe think a project of this caliber deserves nothing but the best, and a clear explainer that explains the function and reason behind Nouns will really bring Nouns to more eyes, normies, and degens alike.\n\n# Summary\n\nOrdinary Folk would leverage our production expertise to manage, creative direct, storyboard, design, animate, and facilitate the composition of an original score, and voice-over recording for a Nouns animated explainer. The full production package.\n\n## Creative Commons\n\nAll of our deliverables will be CC0 with open source files.\n\n![webNavGIF](https://media.giphy.com/media/USgwvuKFBz60A7S5hY/giphy.gif)\n\n# Ordinary Folk’s Process\n\nWe trust the process, and ours is highly iterative and linear. Feedback will be managed differently than in other projects given the nature of the DAO, more specifically:\n\nWhen the project is executed, Ordinary Folk will build out a milestone schedule to send the DAO regular updates requesting specific feedback and guidance on the tone, voice, direction of the animation. \n\nAll Nouners and community will have the opportunity to comment for each work-in-progress in discord for 24 hours. How and if we apply the feedback will be up to our discretion and expertise.\n\nThat said, given the nature of the script writing process, we would ask that we can have at least 1 Nounder that we can have 2 or 3 script conversations with to make sure the messaging is exactly what it needs to be.\n\nStarting with the first concept review, Nouners and community are directly involved in developing the product in a tangible way and Ordinary Folk will guide and decide on how to execute the project for the best product.\n\n💡 From award to delivery, the process generally takes ~8 - 10 weeks\n\n\n\nHere’s an overview…\n\n---\n## Step 1: Scripting\n\nAnimation is a visual and audio storytelling medium but you always start with a good foundation — the script. Messaging in animation is a balance of showing and telling. We'll first focus on having the script stand on its own while building a plan for the visuals and sound.\n\n💡 Scripting generally takes ~1 - 2 weeks\n\n## Storyboarding, Design, & Animation\n\nWhile we work on locking down the script and recording the voice-over, we’ll also be working on creative direction, storyboards, design, sound, and animation. \n\nHere are a few examples of each step:\n\n## Step 2: Storyboarding\n\n![storyboard01](https://i.imgur.com/QQJnRUu.png)\n\n![storyboard02](https://i.imgur.com/ijYffAY.png)\n\n\n### Storyboarding Animatic\n\n[![Storyboard Animatic SOM](https://i.imgur.com/RJtPPY6.png)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KG9_dUej6qcWyWNZIO4cxG3nAh-Lt0g7/view?usp=sharing)\n*Storyboard Animatic for School of Motion.*\n\n## Step 3: Design / Styleframes\n\n![styleframe01](https://i.imgur.com/C1Yaf5o.jpg)\n![styleframe02](https://i.imgur.com/J3fwudv.jpg)\n![styleframe03](https://i.imgur.com/9VKwP1E.jpg)\n![styleframe04](https://i.imgur.com/Z6YEiEB.jpg)\n![styleframe05](https://i.imgur.com/4ibNpPg.jpg)\n![styleframe06](https://i.imgur.com/nmN8FNU.png)\n\n## Step 4: Animation\n\nThe process of animation is very intentional, tedious AND the most exciting phase when you begin to see elements from the designs come to life. \n\nWe'll send a series of videos showing our work in progress (WIP). WIPs may also come in the form of motion tests or a series of gifs. When we have enough motion compiled together we'll send videos that are a mix of still a motion to show our progress.\n\n![Rough Pencil Pass](https://media.giphy.com/media/SiEiGfR0MJiaARmtff/giphy.gif)=\n*Rough Pencil Pass.*\n\n![WIP Animation of the same shot](https://media.giphy.com/media/OsfGmba8n7AtXKjF4O/giphy.gif)\n*WIP Animation of the same shot.*\n\n### WIP Examples\n[![Twilio WIP Example](https://i.imgur.com/vhJT3gu.jpg)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1j2pagFQM_anX-gkFjM-Lq_qOjHM1NlbC/view?usp=sharing)\n*Twilio WIP Example.*\n\n[![School of Motion WIP Example](https://imgur.com/vbvik4M.jpg)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1h1GNwX7DqwD5vk0YCk2pRgLdsgZmUN6-/view?usp=sharing)\n*School of Motion WIP Example.*\n\n## Step 5: Sound\n\n### Voice Over\n\nWhen the script is locked we'll begin the casting for a VO actor. From there we'll have the actor record the script.\n\n### Score & SFX\n\nThe composer will begin scoring when we have a locked animatic with the final VO timing. We'll constantly be tweaking the score and animation to match and elevate each other.\n\nSound design (the process of adding sound effects) and sound mixing (adjusting the levels of the VO, score, and sound effects.) are the finishing touches of our projects. Adding a final level of polish to our work.\n\n# The final product\n\nHere are a few of our favorite pieces which may inspire our work with Nouns:\n\n[![Minima](https://imgur.com/kYoX9OY.jpg)](https://vimeo.com/691634099)\n*Minima*\n\n[![Webflow](https://imgur.com/EkjA6Vy.jpg)](https://vimeo.com/664409837)\n*Webflow*\n\n[![School of Motion](https://imgur.com/20aDMXs.jpg)](https://vimeo.com/360269073)\n*School of Motion*\n\n\n[![SAP](https://imgur.com/AGzRs5x.jpg)](https://vimeo.com/368584682)\n*SAP*\n\n\n# Technical Specs & Delivery\n\n### Specifications\n\nWe’ve scoped this project with these specs:\n\n- 1x - 1 - 2 minute animation delivered in two renders optimized for web and prores.\n- Designed and mastered in 4K, 16:9, 30fps.\n- AE animation project files for CC0 use.\n\n# Pricing\n\n| Description | Pricing in ETH |\n| --- | --- |\n| Fees: Creative Direction, Design, Animation, AE Project Files for CC use | 115 ETH  |\n| Original Score | 8 ETH |\n| Voice-over | 2 ETH |\n**| GRAND TOTAL: | 125 ETH |**\n\n💡 Noun 347 will receive a finders fee of 7% of the total price\n\n\n---\n\n# Production Schedule\n\nIf executed, we’ll deliver a production schedule of 8-10 weeks with a start date not to exceed September 1.\n\n---\n**Thank You!**\n![image alt](https://media.giphy.com/media/xKVASQrGgLX0rIjxpz/giphy.gif) ","proposer":"0xA68FdB0c7ECdC404637C5C06BAB82A7bf00609f3","startBlock":15161228,"endBlock":15180938,"executed":true},"votes":[{"support":1,"voter":"0xE26D78c6bFF297Bbc2dA3f80FEA9a42028a4260F","numberOfVotes":3,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0xe085327c5AD2F77147F10973Fed45Fb19d734F7e","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x2e32935bfD5B2718f99BC8FDf8B37c16811f7D97","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0xa903C06BF35286f6d1cDAD25396748353979a44C","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":"⌐◨-◨ \nGreat way to make more digestible entry points to NounsDAO.

The Descriptor is the contract that stores and renders Noun artwork and token metadata.\n\n**Descriptor Improvements**:\n\n* Significantly cheaper on-chain art deployment, which largely benefits builders that fork the Nouns protocol. The gas required to deploy the Nouns artwork has been reduced nearly 5x.\n* Improved external API, which boosts composability by allowing external contracts to more easily hook into the Noun artwork and rendering engine.\n* Improved descriptor upgradability. The new descriptor separates the artwork, renderer, and facilitator contracts, which enable much cheaper upgrades (e.g. trait retirement).\n\n**Note**: This proposal is separate from the 8/8 art additions, which will be proposed separately in the coming weeks.\n\n* [Specification](https://github.com/nounsDAO/nouns-tech/blob/main/descriptor-v2/README.md)\n* [Pull Request](https://github.com/nounsDAO/nouns-monorepo/pull/499)\n\nThis code has been reviewed by multiple technical community members, has unit/integration test coverage, and has been tested on both Rinkeby and Mainnet.\n\nIn addition, we’ve retroactively fixed seven art errors and oversights. These fixes will not only apply to art moving forward, but will reach back in time to correct Nouns that contain the offending traits. All fixes are either recoloring of existing pixels or removing of extra pixels. Most errors are likely a result of iteration and palette color reduction prior to the launch of Nouns - some that melded two colors into one, or put two formerly-different colors closer to one another. No pixels are being added in this update. Emoji voting in discord indicated support for this effort.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/SSAquuV.png)\n\n**Piggybank**: Removal of cluster of erroneous pixels around the tail region.\n\nReason for error: Oversight.\n\n**Beer**: There are several pixels that are only slightly off in color. They've been filled in with the correct color so it's all one full-bodied beer.\n\nReason for error: Weirdness created by palette color reduction.\n\n**Multicolored glasses**: There are inconsistent rules applied to this trio of frames, resulting in a distracting appearance from one to the next. Additionally, this fix helps retain the frame shape unless they're going to blend into the head, which is an anomaly.\n\nReason for error: Oversight.\n\n**Watermelon frames**: These were the same color as the Guava frames.

FWB is looking for support from Nouns DAO to publicly amplify these conversations to the wider Web3 community and beyond, under CC0 and a content distribution partnership. \n\nAdditionally, we’d like to use this as an opportunity to craft a culturally oriented session around Nouns DAO at the conference, while bridging our communities together through this DAO-to-DAO collaboration. \n\n**Who We Are**\nFriends with Benefits is a worldwide group of creators, thinkers, and builders who sit at the intersection of Web3 and culture. As one of the earliest social token communities, FWB’s members span a diverse range from the heavily crypto native to the more recently, and eagerly, onboarded. \n\n**Introducing FWB FEST**\nBetween August 12-14, 2022, FWB will be hosting the inaugural [FWB FEST](https://fest.fwb.help) in Idyllwild, California to bring together our global community to discuss how Web3 will continue to shape the future of culture. \n\nThe FWB community aims to grow FWB FEST into a premier conference that annually showcases leading topics and conversations around how Web3 is affecting culture. \n\n*FWB FEST will:*\n* Gather ~500 community members IRL \n* Livestream the event to thousands more digitally \n* Take over the historic 200+ acre campus of the Idyllwild Arts Academy in the San Jacinto Mountains outside of Los Angeles\n* Feature a world class speaking and music lineup including:\n\nPerformances: James Blake, Pussy Riot, Oneohtrix Point Never, L’Rain, Weyes Blood, Mustafa, and more \n\nSpeakers: Hayden Adams (Uniswap), Nadya Tolokonnikova (Pussy Riot, Unicorn DAO), David Rudnick, Meltem DeMirors, Glen Wyl (Radical Exchange, DeSoc), Toby Shorin (Other Internet), Kei Kreutler (Gnosis), Yancey Strickler (Metalabel, Kickstarter) & More\n\nFull lineup [here](https://fest.fwb.help/).\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/JLnuCD7.jpg) \n\n\n\n\n**How can we partner?**\n\n**FWB FEST Content Co-Brand and Distribution** \nFWB, with support from Nouns, will capture and record the keynote talks from FWB FEST and make these talks publicly accessible to the world under CC0 through concise video formats. All talks would include Nouns DAO logo placement.\n\nKeynote sample conversations at FWB FEST include:\n\n*Cultural Currency*\nNadya Tolokonnikova (PussyRiot, Unicorn DAO), Hayden Adams (Founder, Uniswap), Trevor McFedries (Brud & FWB)\n\n*Future of Identity & Soul Bound Tokens*\nGlen Weyl (Author, Radical Markets), Christopher Kulendran Thomas (Founder, EARTH), Puja Ohlhaver (Researcher)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Hxr1GRg.jpg)\n\n\n**Nouns DAO Keynote Talk at FWB FEST** \nFWB will organize a keynote talk with and about Nouns, giving people a chance to contextualize Nouns in both an IRL and a thought leadership context. This talk would be crafted in collaboration with Nouns holders to ensure proper representation and storytelling, and would be crafted in collaboration with Jacob Horne and other outspoken Nouners.\n\nThe keynote talk will be hosted live at FWB FEST in front of an audience of ~500 guests, and will be recorded, edited, and distributed as one of the highlighted talks at FWB FEST. \n\nThe main objective will be to contribute public content about Nouns DAO that is tasteful, personable, culturally aligned, and encapsulates a different perspective than the current existing Youtube explainer video formats.\n\n\n**Hosting Nouns DAO on NFT Pirate Radio** \nAs part of this strategy we would also invite Nouns representatives to speak on our most popular digital program, NFT Pirate Radio. \n\nNFT Pirate Radio is presented in collaboration with OpenSea on Twitter Spaces and averages 2,000+ live listeners for each episode. Previous guests of Pirate Radio show include: David Choe, Aaron Penne, Mindy Seu, Andrew Benson, Vivian Fu & Noah Kalina (JPEG2000), and Possessed. \n\nAll NFT Pirate Radio sessions are also recorded and will eventually live as evergreen assets to be further amplified. \n\n**FWB Works in Progress**\nLastly, we would commission a writer within the FWB community to meaningfully tell a story about why Nouns DAO represents an interesting model for brand proliferation via a long-form written piece on FWB Works in Progress, our editorial platform. \n\nPast pieces WIP include:\nWhat Co-Ops and DAOs Can Learn From Each Other by Austin Robey which has garnered 300,000+ impressions. \n\nIn addition to the media strategy above, FWB would integrate Nouns DAO in a few other ways.\n\n**Recognition as official partner of FWB FEST** \nAs an official partner, Nouns branding would be included on the FWB FEST website as well as the FWB newsletter, social media accounts, FEST promotional assets, and on-site guide. \n\n\n**Nouns DAO Ticket Raffle for Nouns Community** \nNouns DAO to receive 10 FWB.FEST NFT tickets to raffle off and give away to Noun community members. \n\n**Why?** \nWe believe this is a meaningful initiative for the Nouns community because it will:\n\n* Democratize and distribute the keynote talks and conversations at FWB FEST for the entire Web3 community to consume, irrespective of location and travel ability.\n* Contribute effective storytelling and thought leadership about Nouns DAO with a cultural perspective and lens \n* Leverage FWB FEST with its high concentration of web3 native and culturally aligned community members. \n* Utilize additional FWB distribution channels like Pirate Radio and FWB Works in Progress to further amplify Nouns storytelling from a cultural perspective \n* Create an initial playbook that Nouns can use to further collaborate with other DAOs\n* Support FWB in its endeavor to create a premier conference and festival experience bridging Web3 and Culture\n\n\n**Funds Requested** \n30 ETH | Video Production Team: Equipment, Labor, Time, Housing, Travel, and Editing\n30 ETH  Stage Production, Lighting, Sound, Venue, and Hard Costs\n10 ETH | FWB FEST Tickets for NounsDAO\n5 ETH | FWB Editorial Commission\n5 ETH | FWB Pirate Radio Nouns Talk Production\n\nTotal: 80 ETH\n\nAll deliverables will be executed between FWB FEST (August 12-14) and September 30th, accounting for proper editing, marketing, and distribution time. \n\n**Who Is Behind This Proposal?**\n\nMembers of the FWB Community & Team Including:\nGabe Quintela, Partnerships\nLindsay Howard, Curatorial & Brand\nAlex Zhang, Mayor\nPaul Tao, Events, Operations\nZach Tetreault, Programming \n& More\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/QE0WmMP.jpg)\n\n\n*Relevant Links*\n[FWB FEST Website](https://fest.fwb.help) \n[NYT Feature on FWB](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/02/technology/friends-with-benefits-crypto-dao.html)\n[Twitter](https://twitter.com/FWBtweets) \n[Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/fwbcollection/?hl=en) \n","proposer":"0x17cd072cBd45031EFc21Da538c783E0ed3b25DCc","startBlock":15182450,"endBlock":15202160,"executed":false},"votes":[]},{"prop":{"id":116,"description":"#  Monthly Nouns Comics for mass market release \n\n![Nouns Comic](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/nouns/original/2X/4/4c07d23a7af2e10e5a36289f75f28e869e9c743a.jpeg)\n\nTl;dr\nA monthly cc0 Nouns comic for Nationwide Distribution.\n\nAn initial 6-issue series would be commissioned for a total of $210,000 USD, paid for by selling 7,000 copies of each issue with an exclusive cover to NounsDAO, to be distributed (or sold) as seen fit. The money will be used to pay for all the creatives as well as ensure the work is owned by NounsDAO (both writing and artwork).\n\nThe team, led by DefaultedUser, a 25-year veteran of comics publishing, will create a comic meant to be released not only to the Web3 community but to comic book stores via Titan Comics and to book stores via Penguin Random House.\n\nThe Community will be allowed to vote on aspects of the publishing project starting in July 2022, with the first issue to release to the community in November 2022, and the mass market in March 2023.\n\nAfter issue #6, profits will be used to publish future issues, still with community involvement, as well as fund other Nouns related publishing projects.\n\nIntroduction\nComics have been an art form for over 100 years now, in many ways overtaking novels as the most important written form of creativity for society, and defining Intellectual Property more than Film or Television. Comics have the advantage of a monthly (in some cases) publishing cycle, are able to pump out more content than other mediums, and so are able to connect with a dedicated audience more frequently, as well as generating more stories than other mediums.\n\nComic Books have brought us Spider-man, Superman, Batman, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Uncle Scrooge, Garfield, The Far Side, and quite literally tens of thousands more. Nouns is a visual creation, with much room for growth. The dedicated fanbase mimics that of core comic book publications of the past, giving the space and time to grow and be recognized by the worldwide community as a whole.\n\nI have worked in the comic book industry for 25 years now, acting in various roles, but most notably as a publisher for various companies (Including Boom! Studios), as well as creating comics for properties such as Divinity: Original Sin 2, Transformers, Farscape, Warhammer, Warhammer 40K, Mickey Mouse, Frozen, Pixar, Pirates of the Caribbean, Spider-man, Thor, Star Wars, and many others.\n\nIn licensing, one is required to work within certain parameters, while creating a compelling product. This will serve me well when creating Nouns product, being able to listen to the community and create something appealing for the community, while also something that can be successful outside of it.\n\nI have extensive knowledge of how to create compelling content and have a publishing and distribution agreement with Titan books (and through them Penguin Random House), so can focus on making this product physical in nature, and not just a digital offering, as well as something that will see Nouns splashed all over thousands of stores.\n\nUtilize comics to generate constant content, keep the community engaged.\nDevelop stories, worlds, and characters that give more sandboxes for the community and other creatives within the community to play with.\nBring Nouns to the “Mass Market” (Comic book stores, book stores, big box stores, book clubs, libraries). Gives legitimacy to the IP, and expands the potential community.\nCommunity Driven Support\n\nNouns is famously known for its treasury, often used to create interesting projects that further the Nouns ecosystem. What we are proposing is to engage and encourage the community to support the project, creating a financial model that isn’t solely dependent upon a treasury, and using that to expand the area and influence of NounsComics.\n\nMuch like Kickstarter, IndieGogo and Substack have used a model that allows early supporters to get exclusive items, while also funding projects that they have an interest in, and so too will NounsComics. The first engagement is to the Web3 community, as well as the Nouns community, offering access to exclusive comics, covers, and finally the ability to vote as a community on artists and authors, story beats, and covers.\n\nThe initial project will be a six issue comic book, along with a graphic novel release. NounsComics will pre-sell this series, in individual segments. The initial offerings will be:\n\nIndividual issues for sale, as well as the graphic novel (as a package)\nA minimum order of 7,000 copies for sale, which will give an individual or community the chance to commission a special cover of the comic book, which will then be only available to them, to be distributed as they see fit (sold, given away, stored, etc.)\nSales of graded copies of the individual comics, to be graded and placed on the blockchain for them via an NFT once the book has been printed. The specific grade is out of 10, with 10 being absolutely perfect in every way (and is almost impossible to attain), so the grades will be at LEAST 9.6, with the final grade being between 9.6 – 10, randomized.\n\nIndividual comics are priced at $5.00 USD dynamic value\nThe Graphic novel is offered at $30.00 USD dynamic value\nThe graded comics will be offered for $250.00 USD dynamic value\nEvery purchase not only helps fund the project, but will also give the purchaser the right to vote on certain aspects of the comic book series. The individual things that can be voted on are :\n\nThe story concept and writer of the project. We will offer a minimum of 3 choices at the outset, prior to the project going on pre-sale. Each of these concepts and writers will be vetted, to ensure to plagiarism, as well as the ability to deliver a commercially viable product.\n\nThe art style and artist of the project. A minimum of 3 art styles and artists are made available for a range of options. Each of the artists will be vetted to make certain they are capable of delivering a product that will be entertaining, engaging and finally released on a timely basis! Two different styles for publishing are included below.\n\n![Nouns Comic](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/nouns/original/2X/3/3140a561969c3d990dd63159d9063bdddac92511.jpeg)\n\n![Nouns Comic](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/nouns/original/2X/9/9c232c4b6d6af9aca8bf953c610d39eb525c65f2.jpeg)\n\n![Nouns Comic](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/nouns/optimized/2X/a/a312ffa11cea1e8c36d9f725b72bdc1b25d85d57_2_1380x664.jpeg)\n\nWhich Nouns will be in the comic series. We will want to make sure that those that pre-purchase the series get to suggest and vote for various Nouns, with the top voted not only appearing in the comic series, but also having the Nouns owner engaged to create the voice and personality of the Noun appearing in the comic series.\nFor every single comics cover there will be at minimum 3 concept sketches provided, with votes choosing which one becomes the final cover. The same process will be used for the graphic novel.\n\nAll funds raised in this manner will be kept in a multi-sig wallet, with funds being released to move the project along, specific amounts for each portion of comic creation and issue.\n\nSo, a specific number will be released for the script to be completed for issue #1. After that is approved, a specific amount will be released for the layout of issue #1. After this, an amount will be released for the pencils to be finished for issue #1. Finally, the remaining sum allotted for issue #1 will be released for Colours and Letters of Issue #1. The same process will be repeated for Issues #2-6. In this manner we can keep progress moving in a timely manner, making sure that there are incentives to create the content quickly, but also doing as good a job as possible.\n\nAs the issues are completed, profits (if there are any) will be split in this manner : Payment of 25% of the profits to the publisher of the series. 25% of the profits to the NounsDAO Treasury itself. 40% will be held by NounsComics to keep the series running, and potentially fund new series down the road, and finally 10% to ComicsDAO, who will be onboarding the writers, artists and community members for votes and sales.\n\nWe use the community to fund and engage with the project\nWe pay back to the community with the success of the project\nThere are various onboarding points to the project that can make the community feel invested, choosing which Nouns appear, the feel and style of the project\nAs this project is printed, it will also be sold into comic book stores (and book stores in the case of the graphic novel). This can allow those not familiar with the Nouns community to see what it is capable of, and gives them a simple yet effective point to become engaged themselves. We have a publishing deal for both markets with major publishers, which is how we will accomplish this, NOT through independent publication.\nProfit and Loss\n\nJust some general calculations for the project :\n\nIf we assume a creative cost for the project of $210,000 USD for the six issue series (broken down as $35,000 USD per issue), we would need roughly 7,500 copies of each book sold to pay for printing and creative.\n\nIf we achieve 10,000 copies sold per issue, along with 200 copies sold of the physically graded comics, the financials would look like this :\n\nRevenues : $675,000 USD\nExpenses: $330,000 USD (this includes creative, printing and grading)\n25% to NounsDAO : $86,250 USD\n25% to Publisher : $86,250 USD\n40% to NounsComics : $138,000 USD\n10% to ComicsDAO : $34,500 USD\nFinancial Breakdown\n\nPer issue Cost:\nPencils : $8,000 USD\nScript : $3,000 USD\nInks : $3,000 USD\nColours : $5,000 USD\nLetters : $1,000 USD\nEditing/Scheduling/Management : $10,000 USD\nBonus for completing book on schedule : $5,000 USD\n\nTotal cost per Issue : $35,000 USD\n\nSchedule:\n\nUpon execution of proposal : $40,000 USD to publisher.\n\nAugust, 2022 : Post images for covers to issue #1, open up comics for sale, provide detailed artwork for voting, as well as detailed story outlines for voting.\n\nSeptember, 2022 : Artist, writers and other voting elements will be finished, and work will begin on issue #1.\n\n$40,000 USD released to publisher.\n\nNovember, 2022 : Issue #1 complete, Issue #2 & #3 written.\n\nSolicitation submitted for sale into comic book stores (for February, 2023 release in stores). Sneak preview available to all who pre-purchased the book.\n\nUpon completion of Issue #1, $40,000 USD released to publisher.\n\nDecember, 2022 : Issue #2 complete, Issue #3 penciled, Issue #4 & #5 written.\n\nUpon completion of Issue #2, $40,000 USD released to publisher.\n\nJanuary, 2023 : Issue #3 complete, Issue #4 penciled, Issue #6 written.\n\nUpon completion of Issue #3, $50,000 USD released to publisher.\n\nFebruary, 2023 : Issue #4 complete, Issue #1 is available for sale in comic book stores across North America and Europe. Pre-ordered books will also be shipped to individuals that placed an order for them. Books that were ordered as graded will be sent off to CGC in order to be graded.\n\nMarch, 2023 : Issue #5 completed. Issue #2 is available for sale in comic book stores across North America and Europe. Same process with pre-ordered books, as well as books ordered as graded. Graded copies of Issue #1 will be shipped to individuals that ordered the book.\n\nApril, 2023 : Issue #6 completed. Issue #3 is available for sale in all relevant places, same with pre-ordered books, etc.\n\nSeptember, 2023 : Graphic novel for the series will be available in book stores throughout North America and Europe.\n\nMulti-Signature Wallet\n\nA wallet with signatures from DefaultedUser, JoshuaFisher and SharkDAO will be used to hold the funds that are released from NounsDAO, as well as sales from all books to individuals and communities. Sales from physical copies and stores will see the money placed in this wallet as well, after the expenses are removed by the Publisher (sales, printing, distribution, etc.)\n\nAll expenses will be itemized and available upon request online, to ensure that the wallet will contain the appropriate amount of money at all times.\n\n25% profits to NounsDAO\n\nThe goal will be to make this a profitable endeavour in order to not just perpetuate published projects for the Nouns community, but to also generate revenues for the Nouns, in return for the initial support, concept generation, and paying back to the community. This will be achieved by placing 25% of the profits in a separate wallet, to be used to purchase Nouns. This will place the money back into the Treasury, and allow us to place additional publishing and content creation proposals ourselves, along with giving us a voice in our ability to vote on initiatives that we are supportive of.\n\nConclusion\nWith this approach, we can engage with the community, incentivize them to participate, and also grow the ecosystem beyond Web3. Until there is an easy onboarding process for the non-Web3 natives, Nouns cannot grow beyond this space. This might seem like an obstacle to overcome, but in fact, it is an asset. Most projects start from zero, with no supportive community to support it, and encourage others to participate.\n\nWe will leave with one story, that illustrates how dangerous no community is, and how it can make or break a project. A comics creator named Jeff Smith published a book series called Bone way back in 1991. At the time, it was one of the few black and white comics, didn’t have the monthly schedule that buyers liked, and was completely different from what was being published at the time. Jeff has commented repeatedly in later years that he nearly canceled the series numerous times within the first 10 issues. It was a very small community that supported his early works and allowed him to keep publishing (55 issues between 1991 and 2004). As the series continued on, it grew in fame and prestige, until in 2005 it was picked up by Scholastic books, and released through their new imprint.

I will be tapping into WEB3SG presence; one of the largest NFT twitter community in Singapore for this activation/promotion of Nouns Booth @ COMEX Singapore\n\n**FUNDS BREAKDOWN**\n|Description|Cost in USD*|Cost in ETH**|Cost in ETH***|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|COMEX booth (4x Days activation)<br><br> Includes:<br> - Designing of booth, having a feature wall<br> for photo opportunity<br> - Setting up / Tearing down / Dispoal <br> - 1x Information counter<br> - 1x TV screen to display live auction<br> - 2x display of Nouns @ COMEX virtual gallery<br> - 2x display of Nouns @ Artnow gallery<br>- 1x Tweet by WEB3SG to promote Nouns Booth<br>- 1x Twitter space to promote Nouns Booth|12,000|10.00|7.50|\n|Noggle Stickers (5,000pcs)|500|0.42|0.31|\n|Pins (1,000pcs)|1,500|1.25|0.94|\n|Tote Bags (500pcs)|900|0.75|0.56|\n|Brochure (2500pcs)|200|0.17|0.13|\n|Socks (500pcs)|800|0.67|0.50|\n|Shirt (500 pcs)|1,900|1.58|1.19|\n|Operations:<br> - 2x manpower for 4 days|4,000|3.33|2.50|\n|Transportation|300|0.25|0.19|\n|Total|22,100|18.42|13.81|\n<!--td {border: 1px solid #ccc;}br {mso-data-placement:same-cell;}-->\n\n*Base on local vendor price converted to USD\n**Considering an ETH avg. price of 1,200 USD due to possible fluctuations\n***Considering current ETH avg. price of 1,600 USD\n\n**SUMMARY**\nThis will be a great opportunity to create a Nounish IRL experience which is spread across 4 days of activation at one of the largest most anticipated annual event in Singapore; an opportunity to have Nouns branding reach out to a wider audience. \n\nAs COMEX is held on 1-4th Sep, this gives me a timeline of around 1 month. If proposal is able to pass and fund received within this week, majority of the funds will be converted to fiat as outlay for manufacturing Nounish goodies, remaining funds will be transfer to WEB3SG (ETH) as payment for the booth space at COMEX. I have already designed and created the files for the booth, thus I can pass them to WEB3SG who will manufacture and erect the booth. I will focus on overseeing the process as well as focusing on execution and administrative work prior to COMEX. \n\n\n**LONG TERM GOAL**\nI will continue to grow Nouns Singapore community under @nounsinsg, with Nouns Booth as the initiate activation. Nounsinsg will serve as a proliferation pod, guidance and point of contact for new contributor as well as creating more IRL Nounish experience in the future. Similar to Aubtoshi, a personal long-term goal is to officially be a Nouner. Until then, I will continue to proliferate Nouns in ways that are fun and effective that I can make possible. A IRL activation that I've been working on would be \"NOUNISH BEACH CLEAN UP' which was passed and supported by SMALL GRANT. (Thank you @noun22) It is scheduled on 13th Aug 2022, you may find more info and update on the event below. \n\nI want to thank all Nouners in advance for giving me the chance to contribute and proliferate Nouns together! \n\n**Transactions**\nGiven the time sensitivity of this proposal, the transaction embedded will send 15 ETH to the Small Grants multi-sig.  If this proposal seems likely to pass in early voting, Small Grants will release the funds to the proposer a few days in advance of the proposal being queued and executed.","proposer":"0x75Ee6eb3d8DAcf41eE2e5307090B197D3E1Cca6E","startBlock":15231913,"endBlock":15251623,"executed":false},"votes":[{"support":1,"voter":"0xa903C06BF35286f6d1cDAD25396748353979a44C","numberOfVotes":2,"reason":"⌐◨-◨\nSeems like a good way to get a lot of eyes on the nouns branding.

Fuel the growth of a sub-community within the Nouns ecosystem.\n\n### **Description**\n\nContinuing the work of Prop #68, #91, and #112, this Esports Pod (comprised of esports-native Nouners and Nounsfolk) will function in a manner similar to the thriving small grants initiative within Nouns. It will use a delegated treasury to look for outsized opportunities within esports to continue proliferating Nouns with the best ROI possible. \n\n#### **Didn't we just pass an esports proposal?**\n- All of our esports proposals so far have been game-specific.\n- We have a very deep talent pool of esports native Nouners and Nounsfolk who can capably proliferate across a variety of titles.\n- Having quick access to funds will allow for better proliferation, as the competitive landscape has an ever-evolving calendar that makes the formal proposal process slow. \n- The pod has already been pitched multiple proposal ideas from high-level esports operators.\n    - Sending international players to the largest fighting game event.\n    - Sponsoring a high-level Dota LAN.\n    - Signing a League of Legends team.\n\n### **Esports Pod**\n- Consisting of Nouners and Nounsfok who are familiar with esports and aligned towards the mission of proliferation across the DAO. \n    - **Sasquatch** (Nouncil, Esports background)\n    - **Brennen** (Nouner, Esports background)\n    - **Maty** (Nouncil)\n    - **Oni** (Nouner, Esports background)\n    - **Brian Cho** (Nouner, Esports background)\n    - **Jason Oliver** (Nouner, Esports background)\n    - **Deeze** (Nouner, Esports background)\n    - **thebeautyandthepunk** (Nouner) \n    - **Brax** (Esports background)\n    - **PPD** (Esports background)\n    - **Griff** (Esports background)\n\n#### **Pod Structure** \n- The structure of the pod will be flexible, this means members can be added/removed based on a supermajority vote.\n- Upon initial deployment, the pod will functionally operate inside of the Nouns Esports Discord server.\n- Members of the Pod will vote over each proposed use of funds.\n    - Any member can sponsor a proposal.\n- A multi-sig consisting of Sasquatch, Brennen, Maty, Brian Cho, and Oni will operate funds.\n- All use of funds will be documented in a manner transparent to the Nouns community.\n\n### **Budget: 369 ETH**\n- This budget will be governed by the members of the Esports Pod and controlled by a 3/5 multi-sig. \n    - Address: [0x8b45D1CACcb3593E9F1015BA8e97AFB68DE3a0d1](https://etherscan.io/address/0x8b45D1CACcb3593E9F1015BA8e97AFB68DE3a0d1)\n- For operational purposes, we will keep a portion of the standing budget as the stablecoin DAI.\n- Distribution:\n    - Proposals (~90%)\n    - Operations (max 10%) -  We've already had a broad range of contributions, any compensation related to those efforts (outside of individual proposals) will have to be voted on internally and awarded retroactively.\n        - Running weekly meetings, onboarding esports operators into Nouns, Discord & Twitter management, building the prop, multiple people taking calls and evaluating pitches, etc. \n        - May explore using Coordinape.\n#### **Potential Use of Funds**\n- Flexible funding towards infrastructure costs for each team we sign to Nouns Esports.\n    - Bootcamps, logistics, special events. \n- Sponsoring additional players, streamers, or teams.\n    - Each game is its own vertical to build within.\n- Funding Projects:\n    - Nouns Network\n        - We see the talent network at Nouns to be one of the best features to leverage as we grow.  These projects may already be independently funded, we would have standing budget available to work with them in an esports capacity.\n            - Examples:\n                - Nouns Esports x [Nounish](https://twitter.com/nounish) (Prop 64) - Filming our players at events, advising on marketing strategy.\n                - Nouns Esports x [Nouns Brand](https://twitter.com/nounsbrand) (Prop 109) - Designed outfits for the players at events, merch for fans.\n                - Nouns Esports x [NOUNS ON THE GROUND](https://twitter.com/nounsotg) (Prop 110) - Sending the Proliferation Pod to events our teams compete in.\n                - Supporting an Esports [Prop House](https://twitter.com/nounsprophouse).\n    - Event Sponsorships\n        - Outsized opportunities to have high brand exposure through streaming or physical events.\n    - Streamers, Pros, or Casters with AR or Physical Noggles.\n    - Creating gamer Noggles with blue light filter.\n    - Creating team jerseys for players and fans.\n- Forking Nouns to create an esports-specific subDAO\n    - Designs created to represent games we participate in.\n### **Future**\n- Sustainability\n    - We believe Nouns Esports inherently works to proliferate the Nouns brand, but we are still interested in exploring a path towards creating a self-sustaining sub-community. \n    - Pillars this could be built on:\n        - Forking Nouns\n            - Exploring a subDAO mechanic which allows for fans to engage with the team at a greater level than existing esports organizations.\n        - Sponsors\n            - Traditional web2 sponsors.\n            - Web3 sponsors that the DAO chooses to affiliate with.\n        - Nouns Esports in-game items\n\n### **Testimonials**\n\n> e-sports has been one of the highest ROI proposals (in terms of attention generated) thus far...the success of nouns e-sports clearly demonstrates the power of handing the reigns to the community\n -[Nounder 4156](https://twitter.com/punk4156/status/1544800982399438849)\n\n>  I was a bit skeptical at first I'll admit but it was our Dota team that got my brother (a perennial crypto skeptic) to go from \"all NFTs are a scam\" to \"all NFTs except for Nouns are a scam\" ... which to me felt big\n -[Nouncillor brianj](https://discord.com/channels/849745721544146955/943943469821476944/996129684200894526)\n \n > One of the reasons why I bought a noun was because I saw the positive impact that the nounsesports was creating to the greater gaming community...watching the dota 2 esports community (hardcore pc gamers) embrace the nouns ⌐◨-◨ meme has been incredible\n-[Nouner Brian Cho](https://twitter.com/brianjcho/status/1543411851907645440)\n\n> Nounsesports was how I first learned about nouns and was really impressed with how the group was able to resonate with a hardcore gaming audience such as pro Dota 2 fans. Given my background helping to build esports at Riot and then as a board director at Astralis, I’m a big believer that esports helps gamers turn their love for games into part of their broader identity. I’m excited to work with the Nouns esports team to proliferate the nouns brand to gamers through esports.\n-Nouner Jason Oliver [via DM]","proposer":"0xDEAD753f9B1eb8F2f7372E8587e7C6e342daac89","startBlock":15239820,"endBlock":15259530,"executed":true},"votes":[{"support":1,"voter":"0x501FeA3B37837CDE179D1C38595eA6d590beCf2E","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0xcEb78aBFad166C11e350156fd671b385265a6C87","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":"It's important for the NFT space to have positive representation in the gaming world.

An initiative that is comprehensive in nature, flexible in delivery, and aligned with specific wellbeing objectives that are drawn from global social and emotional wellness research. Combining our depth of experience in app development, education and content creation to deliver a remarkable outcome.\n\nWe have already created over 100 apps and wellness programs to great success, this will be our best of the best - an innovative, Noun branded mobile app for iOS and Android that will be an important support for kids when they need it most.\n\n## [](https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/proposal-nouns-wellness-app-ios-android/1817#what-are-you-proposing-3)What Are You Proposing?\n\nNOUNS Wellness (name to be confirmed) is a mobile mental health app for the next generation. Using play and community spirit, kids are inspired and engaged with games and activities to actually practice mental health daily.\n\nThis proposal will cover details on how we can do this and why we are the team who can make this happen.\n\nAnd also how this initiative is more than a good idea…\n\nIt’s potentially the very essence that makes NOUNS nounish. And what we see is a perfect match to the mission to not only proliferate the NOUNS brand, but also the NOUNS’ mission of goodwill.\n\nLET’S GO!\n\n## [](https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/proposal-nouns-wellness-app-ios-android/1817#why-are-you-doing-it-4)Why Are You Doing It?\n\nMental health has never been more important post pandemic…\n\n-   …And this time it’s the kids who are feeling the pressure, not just stressed out adults or Web3 degens. There are global stats that show some very alarming numbers with teen depression, anxiety and sadly suicides. There’s a lot to find wrong with the world, so activaley reminding, educating and inspiring young people has become integral to their wellbeing and their future.\n    \n-   Nouns Wellness will also have a natural ripple effect through our Web3 community. As part of the crypto culture, mental health is on everyone’s lips in Twitter Spaces and in Discord, but there has yet to be the wellness project to emerge and really connect with and serve the wider Web3 community.\n    \n-   Nouns is a project close to our hearts and we are aligned with what it represents. It excites us to see the diverse range of future collaborations and partnerships where we can proliferate the brand and its mission.\n    \n\n## [](https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/proposal-nouns-wellness-app-ios-android/1817#why-nouns-5)Why Nouns?\n\nSomething that makes habits stick and fitness routines engaging is play and fun.\n\n-   As pioneers in transforming fitness education with play at its center, we saw immediately how a playful and fun brand like Nouns can boost the wellness conversation with young people.\n-   And at the same time boost the Nouns brand and positioning further, by activating real world engagement with Nouns and the super healthy benefits of a wellness practice.\n\nIn a word… Nouns will make wellness FUN. And Nouns are what wellness will look like for young kids. No-one is owning this wellness space for kids the way Nouns can.\n\n(Plus as a Web3 native brand Nouns open the door to the conversation with young people about NFTs and what the blockchain means to our future.)\n\n## [](https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/proposal-nouns-wellness-app-ios-android/1817#how-is-this-different-to-whats-already-out-there-6)How Is This Different to What’s Already out There?\n\nThe go-to apps out there: Headspace, Calm and similar, are designed for adults.\n\nThey also only offer one type of mindfulness, (including ones for children) - guided experiences that are consumed in one direction. In our decades of experience with kids (and adults too) we have proven that interactive activities and playful tasks are game changers. Like moving your body with active play instead of reps on a gym mat.\n\nThis interactive approach is a major point of difference in the overall physical and mental wellbeing space. There are so many ways of doing wellbeing, but they’re not fun… Until NOUNS Wellness.\n\nAdditionally: The app source code we create will be open source and available for use by the Noun community.\n\n## [](https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/proposal-nouns-wellness-app-ios-android/1817#who-is-the-audience-how-are-you-going-to-market-this-app-7)Who Is the Audience? How Are You Going to Market This App?\n\nAs established business owners and leaders in the fitness, education and wellness space, we have an active database of 45,000+ teachers, schools, fitness professionals and educators who are actively trusting and consuming everything we create. A recommendation from us to this audience will activate thousands of teachers and schools as users.\n\nAmong these people we also have strong and reliable partnerships to further amplify reach and engagement beyond the Web3 universe. Offering free, engaging and ‘cool’ resources for kids’ wellbeing is something these communities are hungry for.\n\nAdditionally our wellness podcast features interviews with olympians, human potential leaders, international sports personalities and even actors: Energetic Radio by Dale Sidebottom with 260 episodes, weekly releases and thousands of monthly listeners. We are also both regular speakers and have been on stages in 40+ countries. We will promote the app to our engaged social media channels and activate webinar style campaigns, so NOUNS can leverage our existing network and following.\n\nIn short it’s not our first rodeo, we are not a startup like many projects in the Web3 space. We are seeing a synergy between our experience, our existing client base and the Noun brand to elevate both for greater impact – creating the foundations of the future world that Web3 stands for and ideas this project believes in.\n\nWe also aim to place Nouns at the forefront of supporting the Web3 community who are battling with extreme emotions of the daily game of NFT’s and Crypto.\n\nBeyond this scope we believe Nouns could have wider appeal to the global issue of declining health and wellness. We see Nouns Wellness as contributing toward the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal Number 3: Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages.\n\n## [](https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/proposal-nouns-wellness-app-ios-android/1817#whos-creating-it-8)Who’s Creating It?\n\nWe’re two dads from Australia, and we are also two highly successful Web2 startup founders who have been in crypto since 2017.

This show would be CC0.**\n\n# **DESCRIPTION**\n**We propose to create a pilot for *Nouns! An Animated Series*.** \n*Nouns! An Animated Pilot* is a 2D tradigital animated 11-minute episode as seen in the [Prop 70 (CC0 Pitchbook)](https://nouns.wtf/vote/70). The show is an animated comedy following the surreal adventures of best friends balancing the desire for mature adulthood and their reluctance to grow up.\n\n# **We propose doing a pilot in 3 phases.**\n**1) Script and Casting (weeks 1-6)** **$150K** \n*-1st milestone Deliver Script Tk01 Draft (End of Week 3)*\n**2) Animatic (weeks 4-11) $200K** \n*-2nd milestone Deliver Storyboards (End of Week 9)*\n**3) Final Animation (weeks 10-16) $150K** \n\nWe are targeting the schedule for ~16 weeks. However, we may need some flexiblity and increase the time it takes to deliver the pilot to ensure we can put out the best product possible.\nIf we start at the beginning of August, we can deliver before the year end.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/mKXuW47.jpg)\n\n## **Phase 1: Scripting and Casting** \nThis phase would last for four-six weeks.\nDuring this phase we would work on the outline, script, script revisions and cast the episode.\nStart Date: **08/01/22** \n\n## **Phase 2: Preproduction**\nStarting week 4, we would begin Phase 2.\nThis phase would last seven weeks.\nDuring this phase, we will thumbnail, and storyboard, refine character designs, and backgrounds, create digital puppets and record scratch tracks and audio.\nStart Date: **08/22/22**\n\n## **Phase 3: Production/ Post**\nStarting week 10, we would begin Phase 3.\nThis phase is where the actual animation begins, with compositing, editing, and putting the final touches on everything.\nStart Date: **10/03/22**\n\n# **TOTAL ASK:**\n**~Ξ320 or ($500K USD)** to fund the creation of Nouns! An Animated Pilot. \n*The ETH will be immediately converted to USDC to ensure we have funding to cover production costs.*\n\n**MULTISIG**\nThe proposed budget + Ξ1 to cover gas fees will be released in ETH to a 3 of 4 multisig with signers **JoelCares**, **ToadyHawk**, **Benbodhi** and **thepencil.eth**. The ETH will be immediately converted to USDC, and everything in excess of the original budget, minus 1 ETH to cover gas for the life of the multisig, will be returned to the DAO. If, due to high volatility, insufficient ETH is available to cover the proposed budget, a second proposal will top up the multisig at a later date.\n\n**Multisig address:**\n0x3D2268fa80B76448A8b33d554A3E972f5d8d5534\n\n**Phases to be funded at the commencement of each phase.

Artists' short-term freelance rates are higher than longer-term employment rates. There are also discounts on software subscriptions for longer-term commitments.\n\n# **WHY IS THIS UNIQUE?**\nIn developing *Nouns! An Animated Series*, the mission of *Person Place Thing Studios* is to share, inspire, and empower people around the globe through CC0 storytelling.\n\nAs paid professionals in the animation space, we aim to modernize the animation studio and pipeline by no longer requiring industry talent to be tethered to an antiquated studio system, a specific geographic location, or a traditional network distribution model.\n\nWe plan to hire best-in-class artists and designers, make broadcast-quality Nounish content at an accelerated pace, and proliferate Nouns to a worldwide audience via the internet.\n\n# **WHAT IS THE TONE OF THE SHOW?**\n*Nouns! An Animated Series* draws from similar humor and animation quality as *The Regular Show* and *Adventure Time*.  We want to create shows that make us laugh!  Our cast of characters are goofballs!  They escalate simple situations into ridiculous adventures that are filled with unpredictable twists and turns. They rarely solve their problems but always end with a laugh!\n\n# **WHY SHOULD WE BACK THIS?**\n- Bringing Nouns to life through animation is the next leap in introducing these characters to the mainstream culture of all ages.\n- Distributing on Youtube, Twitter, Tiktok, etc, allows Nouns to reach an enormous audience.\n- Casting top talent as the voices of our characters will bring known celebrities to the world of Nouns and generate larger social media awareness and traditional media buzz.\n- Developing episodes in the 11-minute format also opens the door to legacy media distribution.\n\n# **BENEFITS TO THE DAO**\n- We love the Nouns characters and are dying to see them come to life!\n- Pilot episode will be CC0!\n- Cartoons are a great source of memeonic content; our show will create many shareable clips that can help with the mission of proliferation.\n- Cartoons are also a great invitation to a much wider and younger audience. \n- There will be new nounish content made and shared every day!\n- Having an animated show will add value to other extensions in the Nouns ecosystem.\n- Through Discord, the DAO will be an active participant in the creative process.\n- Any profits obtained will be reinvested in the studio to make additional Nouns animated content.\n- *Person Place Thing Studios* can be utilized in the creation of content for future DAO Proposals (episodic cartoons, commercial endeavors, music videos, shorts, etc)(i.e. The Greidiens pitch gets sold to a network, rather than having to shop around looking for a studio to work with we would already be set up to handle their needs.)\n- As educators, we will be inviting and sending the CC0 assets to schools for their students to use as they learn animation while creating nounish content.\n\n# **WHO ARE THE CREATIVES?**\n\n**Sam Ellis:**\nSam Ellis (Person) makes comics, cartoons, and games (Things) although he has also helped create a few people as well. He has worked for a myriad of comic publishers, animation, and game studios in a variety of positions from LA to Atlanta (Places). Some of his past projects have been: *Archer, Adventure Time, Bravest Warriors, The Awesomes, Frisky Dingo, Catbug*, and more.\n\n**Jason Shwartz:**\nJason Shwartz is an Emmy-nominated Director with extensive experience in broadcast television production and direction. He has directed broadcast shows for *Netflix, [adultswim], Comedy Central, Hulu, 20th Century Fox, SyFy, AppleTV, IFC, FX, and Disney*.  He has produced original animated content for social games with companies including *Disney Interactive, Marvel, ESPN, and Garfield*.\n\nJason has worked on popular television shows including *Aqua Teen Hunger Force, Wolfboy and the Everything Factory, Squidbillies, The Masked Singer, Paradise Police Department, Lazor Wulf, The Awesomes*, and more!\n\n**Previous accomplishments in the proliferation of Nouns:**\n- [Co-developed NounsTown, an extension project of Nouns introducing PFD (profile deeds) A profile picture that proves ownership of land in the metaverse](https://nounstown.wtf/), and a [Nouns Auction Tracker](https://nounstown.wtf/tracker).\n- Brought and showcased Nounish extensions into the metaverse via BLOCKS giving the ability to make user-generated content easy to share, such as 3D Nouns and other projects.\n- [Active Nouncil member that regularly participates in voting](https://nouncil.wtf/)\n- [Active participant and on the organizing committee for The Noun Square (A group of nounish builders hosting daily celebrations around Noun O’Clock)](https://twitter.com/noun_o_clock)\n- Introduced Samsung to Nouns (through Joey at Buoy Studio) which lead to their video in Times Square and 837X DCL experience.\n- [Prop 70 (CC0 Pitchbook)](https://nouns.wtf/vote/70)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Kamhh0c.jpg)\n\n# **PITCHBOOK:**\n*Below are attached parts of the pitchbook from Prop 70, we thought rather than attaching all the pages we would just attach a few.* \n**The outlines, character bios, and their designs will be further developed if funded.*\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/nPySACM.jpg)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/OOerzzy.jpg)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/n8f0qi3.jpg)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/UDAn6Zw.jpg)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/FtnmcAD.jpg)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/pW3qMnG.jpg)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/iSAAAiX.jpg)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/0lvXKtH.jpg)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/KFIPUSz.jpg)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/S4Y0uQl.jpg)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/v3tPsar.jpg)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/pKfvpDI.jpg)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/xvRZ4b4.jpg)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/9TGaTG9.jpg)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/0VVEX0M.jpg)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/wd2ngDd.jpg)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/HpaAM1z.jpg)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/CuMar4K.jpg)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/m8NXn8N.jpg)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/2U1AyiE.jpg)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/gsEEIlO.jpg)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/eqrbhiM.jpg)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Ua8N87m.png)","proposer":"0xcC2688350d29623E2A0844Cc8885F9050F0f6Ed5","startBlock":15247454,"endBlock":15267164,"executed":false},"votes":[{"support":0,"voter":"0x4754b7e3DEde42D71d6c92978f25F306176EC7e9","numberOfVotes":24,"reason":""},{"support":0,"voter":"0x75Ee6eb3d8DAcf41eE2e5307090B197D3E1Cca6E","numberOfVotes":18,"reason":""},{"support":0,"voter":"0x2e32935bfD5B2718f99BC8FDf8B37c16811f7D97","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":0,"voter":"0x2573C60a6D127755aA2DC85e342F7da2378a0Cc5","numberOfVotes":45,"reason":""},{"support":0,"voter":"0xe085327c5AD2F77147F10973Fed45Fb19d734F7e","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":0,"voter":"0x5ca6a2e5f53a48616d4ead87fF6034fc032D4722","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":"Remember when Ronnie died and you said you wished it was me?

For example, a community could vote on who to receive funds or what NFT to buy or even mint, and depending on the result of the vote, the transaction would be executed.\n\nMore excitingly, it also enables composable governance that could combine different transactions. For example, a community could vote on different features for an NFT, and the top three options could be combined to mint a unique image reflecting the different votes.\n\nExtensible contracts would enable a whole new generation of projects in the Nouns ecosystem.\n\nSome examples, please: how will this proliferate Nouns?\n\nWe imagine Nouns forks in the future won’t simply replicate Nouns but develop unique minting and auction mechanisms of their own to innovate on the Nouns playbook—not simply its art, but its model.\n\nHere are a few examples of Nouns forks that jokedao could enable through extensible contracts:\n\nCreate-a-Noun. Communities could submit and vote on the different properties of a Nouns that could then be automatically generated to incorporate each of the individual qualities.\n\nUser-generated Nouns. Enable NFT-derived voting power so that communities could create interactive Nouns projects in which the holders of NFTs could collectively submit and vote on the design of each subsequent NFT.\n\nNouns governance giveaways. Every 10th Noun (derivative) could be given away to a member of the community who had voted on the most winning options in the previous 9 contests, in order to incentivize voting and reward those who build social consensus with a community to vote on winning options.\n\nNouns governance rewards. Rewards (NFTs, Poaps, tokens, portions of the treasury, etc.) could be given away to those who have voted consistently in Nouns proposals in order to incentivize active participation.\n\nOn-chain Nouns Grants. jokedao could collaborate with Prop House to enable fully on-chain and open-source grants for communities to use to incentivize builders to develop their NFT universe.\n\n## Context\n\njokedao started as a Nouns fork through its proof-of-concept, the jokerace—a weekly contest in which the community of $JOKE holders votes on the 2nd best joke of the week, which is minted as an NFT that’s sold on a recurring basis. It is likely the first case in which an NFT collection was fully community-created. Since launching in the spring, the jokerace has regularly drawn around 100 weekly players who return each week, consistently sold NFTs, and incentivized the creation of teams that compete. In other words, as a DAO, it’s organically incentivized the creation of subDAOs without input or management from the core team.\n\nSince then, jokedao has built a platform with scaffold eth for creating and running contests by minting voting tokens and sharing them with communities. Currently 8 EVM-compatible chains are supported so communities can deploy contests and voting tokens on Ethereum, Polygon, Optimism, Arbitrum, etc. We are relaunching with clean, beautiful UI in a few weeks.\n\nProjects like MetricsDAO and Backdrop already use jokedao for contests with their community, and jokedao has soft commits from about another dozen projects in the space to use it for governance after the site relaunch—many of these are NFT projects looking to give their communities more ways to collectively create NFTs themselves. Other popular use cases include grants, giveaways, and content creators letting their communities tell them what kind of content to create.\n\nFinally, let’s emphasize that neither bottom-up nor on-chain governance have been unlocked in NFTs or DAOs to date. Projects typically give few avenues for their communities to express their ideas or cocreate beyond approving proposals of a core team. And on-chain governance has been prohibitive due to gas fees until the past few months.\n\nBoth of these unlock exciting opportunities for DAOs and NFT projects to create far more inclusive and incentivized communities—as we’ve seen with both Nouns and the jokerace.\n\n## Why?\n\nNouns is unique among NFT projects for a number of reasons—but perhaps most of all that it’s the only NFT project with the means and model to incentivize builders to develop its ecosystem’s value through forks, homages, expansion packs, and next-generation projects. No other NFT project has this.\n\nJokedao’s thesis is that the next wave of NFTs and DAOs will be far more interactive and community-governed than this last wave—which has primarily seen centralized figures appealing to consumers to support them, rather than to actively cocreate. Nouns has shown the strongest evidence of this trend, and it seems clear that the next generation of NFT DAOs will go further in letting their communities compete, team up, and create as fun forms of gamified governance. Nouns is in the best position to support these projects within its own ecosystem to grow its value, and jokedao would love to team up to make it happen.\n\n## Deliverables\n\nExtensible contract module: enabling contests to automatically execute transactions depending on the result of a vote\nCreator submission control: enabling only contest creators to submit options for a community to choose from (avoiding user-generated code that may have issues)\nComposable contracts: enabling different winning votes to be combined, for example to combine different properties of a Nouns into a new NFT\nCore Team\n\nDavid Phelps is a 2x SaaS founder who cofounded ecodao, created a web3 angels collective (cowfund), advises TCG Crypto, is a Gitcoin Steward, and writes on web3 on his substack and twitter 1. He was named one of the top 20 leaders in the DAO space by Seed Club.\n\nSean McCaffery is a Software and Data Engineer with a background in building systems for finance and data analytics firms, is building DAOs including Juicebox and the towers three, and has been the engineer of jokedao’s entire current site. Here is their GitHub 1 and Twitter.\n\nNaomi Hauret has been a front-end developer for the past 6 years. She’s designed and developed Tombheadzzz, developed the UI and frontend for ftm.bet, and has designed and developed holodevdao, a derivate NFT viewer for the Dev NFTs of Developer DAO. You can see her github here 1.\n\n## Budget\n\nWe anticipate extensible contracts to be a 10-week project, and we pay each member $2,000 USD per week. At current prices, total projected costs run around 50 eth.","proposer":"0x8C2Fc764A4AD45984792Ad7680Ed5E62F772A31F","startBlock":15247687,"endBlock":15267397,"executed":false},"votes":[{"support":0,"voter":"0x2573C60a6D127755aA2DC85e342F7da2378a0Cc5","numberOfVotes":45,"reason":""},{"support":0,"voter":"0xe085327c5AD2F77147F10973Fed45Fb19d734F7e","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":0,"voter":"0x5ca6a2e5f53a48616d4ead87fF6034fc032D4722","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":"I used to cut up they buddies, now they sayin' they love me\nUsed to tell they friends I was ugly and wouldn't touch me\nThen I showed up in that dubbed-out buggy\nAnd then they got fuzzy and they don't remember that\nAnd I don't remember you"},{"support":1,"voter":"0xB47A70dF538b9a3B591bC5D75Da66A04c879b291","numberOfVotes":2,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0xDCb4117e3A00632efCaC3C169E0B23959f555E5e","numberOfVotes":6,"reason":""},{"support":0,"voter":"0xF627E5F4BAd95a956468d8BB6Ee20b119F992E96","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0xF0AE4f60a4dc379Ae25371a34b4B699dEE8D530f","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":"Jokedao is seriously badass"},{"support":0,"voter":"0x7D81478Ad18ad375e53De6F74F3122F6be3499ca","numberOfVotes":2,"reason":""},{"support":2,"voter":"0xE3064d830c35119a83402636816444446Ac72d36","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":2,"voter":"0xa555d1Ee16780B2d414eD97f4f169c0740099615","numberOfVotes":2,"reason":""},{"support":0,"voter":"0x203cC9B81C53Fd649BD575E0E19925DD1a2A54da","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x36A5Bc205DF1ED65C86301022cfc343a6ce546ff","numberOfVotes":2,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0xE8D24bE3ABF6EB27B800F752A969D3C1E84fD401","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":0,"voter":"0xBd7Dbab9AEb52D6c8d0E80fCeBdE3af4CC86204A","numberOfVotes":6,"reason":""},{"support":0,"voter":"0xA86882277E69FbF0a51805cdc8b0a3a113079E63","numberOfVotes":4,"reason":"https://i.imgur.com/8TGqk2P.jpg"},{"support":0,"voter":"0xcC2688350d29623E2A0844Cc8885F9050F0f6Ed5","numberOfVotes":10,"reason":"⌐◨-◨"},{"support":0,"voter":"0x6937db08Db977C734Fc1cE884D2915b05147F845","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":"The Noun Square votes on Proposals according to what is decided via a Live Audience Vote on our daily Noun O’ Clock Twitter Spaces. \n\nWe summarized Proposal 122 for the audience, who were then invited to vote LIVE on our discord.

His face appears on posters all over Paris and has been since 2001. Often found next to Invader or M. CHAT, John is a mystery and a joke in the art world. His motto is 'It is the promotion that makes the artist or the zero degree of art.' Recently, John has shown a lot of interest developing ideas around AR and Metaverse/NFTs. He has reached out to Coralorca after a Twitter follow, and they talked about doing some nounish things together, starting with a noggles campaign.   \n## VALUE PROPOSITION\nIt is interesting for NounsDAO to position themselves along something mysterious that comes from the streets, from the art world, and support artists while doing so. People will notice the glasses and wonder what it all means, it will trigger their imagination and curiosity. On top of that, France has a strong Web3 community that will surely notice. \n## SCOPE OF THE PROJECT\nA total of 1000 wheat posters and John will change his PFP on twitter and instagram during the campaign. \n500 posters 70*100cm in Paris, with 10 of them in a circular “profile picture” 100cm*100cm format.\n250 posters 70*100cm in Marseille, with 10 of them in a circular “profile picture” 100cm*100cm format.\n250 70*100cm in Lyon, with 10 of them in a circular “profile picture” 100cm*100cm format.\n+ a bonus projection on the BNF (National French Library) similar to picture below\n![Artist Projection Mockup](https://www.jiji-studio.com/assets/JohnHamonBNF.png)\nJohn will make sure this is well documented with short movies and pictures. I also have contacts in Paris if we need additional videos.\nSome quick mockups by the artist:\n![Artist Mockups](https://www.jiji-studio.com/assets/JohnHamonMockups.png)\nRegarding legality: the posters will be placed on tolerated areas like construction sites, public poster boards etc And the circular ones will be placed where there are already a few invaders and other street artists, where it is tolerated.\nCoral Orca will organize a street marketing campaign next to the posters with chalk stencils. We decided to have the noggles in different colors as well and not show any website url - keep it mysterious for now. \nJohn will also post on his instagram account about the campaign and modify his profile picture to add the nouns glasses.\n## LINKS\nhttps://www.instagram.com/john_hamon/ (250K followers)\nhttps://www.compulsivecontents.com/detail-event/the-mysterious-face-of-paris/\n## PROJECT TIMELINE\nEnd of August 2022 for Marseille.\nSeptember-October 2022  for Paris and Lyon (When everyone in France is back to the city to work)\n## TEAM\nJohn Hamon https://twitter.com/johnhamon_ \nCoral Orca https://twitter.com/coralorca \n## COMPENSATION\nWe are asking for a total of 22 ETH - 15 for John and his team, 5.5 for the stencil campaign, and 1.5 for Coral Orca for organizing it. \n## TRANSACTIONS\n15 ETH to 0xbb3844536bcb17c20b36da2ec20f90a03865c945\n7 ETH to 0x8833Db8110D54c5632B67b83441AccbdA5B23bF4\n\n","proposer":"0x7Dd5B92716542AB2442030Df6d87cEc437A51Ded","startBlock":15295213,"endBlock":15314923,"executed":true},"votes":[{"support":1,"voter":"0x7Dd5B92716542AB2442030Df6d87cEc437A51Ded","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":"love everything about it, very nounish collab with a respected artist done in an elegant way \n"},{"support":1,"voter":"0xF627E5F4BAd95a956468d8BB6Ee20b119F992E96","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x9f4838f18104f4973Aa0972A73A3F50bDeBf86Ba","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0xE8D24bE3ABF6EB27B800F752A969D3C1E84fD401","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x008c84421dA5527F462886cEc43D2717B686A7e4","numberOfVotes":5,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x91dCCAA260CC4616E1a6e6b693DB7207C5E42937","numberOfVotes":2,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0xcEb78aBFad166C11e350156fd671b385265a6C87","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0xDCb4117e3A00632efCaC3C169E0B23959f555E5e","numberOfVotes":6,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x2573C60a6D127755aA2DC85e342F7da2378a0Cc5","numberOfVotes":45,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x75Ee6eb3d8DAcf41eE2e5307090B197D3E1Cca6E","numberOfVotes":18,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x4754b7e3DEde42D71d6c92978f25F306176EC7e9","numberOfVotes":27,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0xC46Db2d89327D4C41Eb81c43ED5e3dfF111f9A8f","numberOfVotes":2,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0xDEAD753f9B1eb8F2f7372E8587e7C6e342daac89","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x2f5Bfd77dDf8d810fae1CFDaA2af19871f3F96C2","numberOfVotes":2,"reason":"John Hamonouns ⌐◨-◨ started following me on Twitter so I must vote for this proposal."},{"support":1,"voter":"0x5ca6a2e5f53a48616d4ead87fF6034fc032D4722","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWXWivwhi14&ab_channel=ReginaSpektor"},{"support":1,"voter":"0x5D802e2Fe48392c104Ce0401C7ECa8a4456f1F16","numberOfVotes":11,"reason":"Street art is nounish"},{"support":1,"voter":"0x7D81478Ad18ad375e53De6F74F3122F6be3499ca","numberOfVotes":2,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x9a2F6117D1FFa82ad0A2B36f133d476DB5bD55F5","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x4e2e67836d10B02B1DCe78591af6DFd1e2d7BCBA","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x3496f3600070CC01d9665d1057F6F39afC0fe149","numberOfVotes":2,"reason":"gm"},{"support":1,"voter":"0xA1c0b11B86A46885B87c7ed68b91FAa0C349e1cD","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0xcC2688350d29623E2A0844Cc8885F9050F0f6Ed5","numberOfVotes":13,"reason":"⌐◨-◨"},{"support":1,"voter":"0x021edd67d43B365a6401a5Ee704Aa6f264F3F4e4","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0xa903C06BF35286f6d1cDAD25396748353979a44C","numberOfVotes":3,"reason":"Nounish af ⌐◨-◨ "},{"support":1,"voter":"0xBd7Dbab9AEb52D6c8d0E80fCeBdE3af4CC86204A","numberOfVotes":6,"reason":"⌐◨-◨"},{"support":1,"voter":"0x7DECf7a31168778f311c57B9a948aBaa7321001E","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x6937db08Db977C734Fc1cE884D2915b05147F845","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":"The Noun Square votes on Proposals according to what is decided via a Live Audience Vote on our daily Noun O’ Clock Twitter Spaces. \n\nCoral Orca summarized Proposal 126 for the audience, who were then invited to vote LIVE on our discord.

We are homegrown web3 natives aiming to bridge the gap between streetwear & crypto culture.\n\nInspired by Nouns DAO, our membership structure has a Nounish distribution, and we’ll be kicking off our auctions later this year. Holders of Dopamine Membership NFTs determine the creative direction of Dopamine, in addition to revenue sharing and perks at our IRL events.\n\nAs a streetwear-focused web3 project our goal is to bridge the divide between the physical and digital worlds. Though we recognise the growing market for digital-only fashion, as Hypebeasts who tend to spend [an insane amount of money](https://www.highsnobiety.com/p/streetwear-supreme-fans-spending-habits/) on streetwear and [sneakers](https://stockx.com/news/sneakerheads-spend-10-of-income-on-kicks/#), we love our physical pieces and really couldn’t live without them.\n\nIn contrast to a project like RTFKT for example we are physical-first, meaning that upon physical delivery of our garments, customers must scan a microchip to authenticate ownership, after which they will receive the bundled NFTs.\n\nIt’s undeniable that NFTs have unleashed a new cultural revolution, putting the creative power in the hands of digital artists, musicians, and photographers, and creating an exploding market for digital collectibles. This is the energy we want to bring to streetwear.\n\nSo we’re taking the best of both worlds as physicals take us off our screens and bring us together through something tactile, while NFTs unlock a new world with limitless creative possibilities.\n\nThe Dopamine Team is thrilled to collaborate with Apenoun to design a limited-supply Nouns-inspired non-fungible streetwear bundle for the Dopamine Marketplace launch at Art Basel Miami. With this collab we hope to push the Nounish culture forward and proliferate the Nouns meme and brand across the Metaverse and into mainstream pop culture.\n\n\n## **Non-Fungible Streetwear Bundles**\n\nThe main product Dopamine offers partners are limited-edition “non-fungible streetwear bundles” consisting of these parts:\n\n- The physical streetwear piece embedded with the Dopamine microchip.\n- The “physical-bound NFT” (PNFT), a digital 3D model of the piece, forever cryptographically bound to the microchip.\n- “Accessory NFTs”, which could include digital art, represent brand loyalty or event perks, or any other creative expression partners wish to include in the bundle.\n\n![dopamine2|690x388](https://www.notion.so/image/https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fsecure.notion-static.com%2F75a968c0-03ba-467c-8271-032bd8679892%2FScreenshot_2022-08-01_at_12.07.54.png?table=block&id=0876c198-98e2-4ea3-bd2a-816177363ff5&spaceId=ba19d8ff-64a6-48a3-b1b8-4d690f10f95f&width=2000&userId=f55ed8db-e5a2-4f22-a7b5-744d0899742f&cache=v2)\n\n\n## **Dopamine Studio Curation**\n\nDopamine Studio is the one-stop shop for brands and creators to create Non-Fungible Streetwear either from scratch or by bundling their already existing merchandise. \n\nThis product is intended to be released nearing Q1, providing a Manifold-like experience to end-to-end collection curation made specially for streetwear. Before that, Dopamine will offer this service to partners on a case-by-case consultancy basis, with Nouns as one of the first partners.\n\n![dopamine3|690x388](https://www.notion.so/image/https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fsecure.notion-static.com%2F0d708d0b-ab63-4ec1-a265-78ae6af0aab3%2F4_4.png?table=block&id=9d06c861-10a8-45a4-8f5b-2dc45e2e8a98&spaceId=ba19d8ff-64a6-48a3-b1b8-4d690f10f95f&width=2000&userId=f55ed8db-e5a2-4f22-a7b5-744d0899742f&cache=v2)\n\n## **Supported Customizations**\n\n- 3D PNFT Design\n    - The media file for the PNFT (that which is directly bound to the garment through our Microchip) will feature a 3D rendition of the physical garment.\n- Accessory NFT Designs / Media Uploads\n    - Each Non-Fungible Streetwear Piece may be bundled with additional accessory media files bundled as NFTs. These can be alternative skins, complementary music files, avatars, etc.\n- Collection-specific Specs\n    - These will include royalties, distribution strategies (e.g. fixed-price sale vs. DAs), NFT types, etc.\n\nDopamine will work closely with Apenoun to create a fully on-brand Nouns Streetwear Bundle, with specifications that fit with the Nouns ethos.\n\n## **Creator Flow**\n\n![dopamine4|690x233](https://www.notion.so/image/https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fsecure.notion-static.com%2Fa39b45a6-b503-466c-83a6-ce00964ec3dd%2FScreen_Shot_2022-07-29_at_1.29.11_AM.png?table=block&id=aa58afb1-2776-42cf-9697-b2d8a7c09e83&spaceId=ba19d8ff-64a6-48a3-b1b8-4d690f10f95f&width=2000&userId=f55ed8db-e5a2-4f22-a7b5-744d0899742f&cache=v2)\n\n## **Dopamine Microchips**\n\nDopamine microchips are two-sided, 27mm round, 1mm thick NFC chips with silver foliage.

I'm a no for now,\" was one comment from our Nouncil Discussion Thread. \"It seems like a duplicative effort,\" was another. \"The generous 15:85 rev split isn’t enough to make up for the lack of Nounish brand experience.\"  \n\nProponents of the project liked the novel NFT ownership verification, and the Nounish apparel mockups that were released maybe just a little too late to sway the vote (after the team spoke on The Noun Square last night and dropped into Nouncil to show Nounish mockups and clarify some things, a flood of YES votes did come in, but ultimately not enough to win the vote.) \n\nExample comments on the Discussion thread after the TNS appearance and new mockups: \"Having been sceptical, I've been really impressed by Dopamine on NoC. I think it's taken a while to articulate the scope of the vision, and why it's nounish: Community, web3 native, proof of work, tech innovation (and it will be fully noggle branded).

Spearheaded by [Toady Hawk](https://twitter.com/toady_hawk), [Ser Noadz](https://twitter.com/thenoadz) and [Noun 142](https://twitter.com/1fortytwo), administered by a talented committee of Nounish builders, and supported by a growing international community.\n\nAfter a two week unpaid experiment, plus a one month funded trial ([Prop 101](https://nouns.wtf/vote/101)), we believe we have proven our worth to the Nouns ecosystem, both as a daily touchpoint for the community, and as a powerful onboarding tool for Nouns-curious passers-by the world over. We are requesting funding to continue running and growing the show for the remainder of the 2022 calendar year.\n\n## Accomplishments\n* **58 Consecutive Daily Spaces**, none missed. \n* **A 24-hour Twitter Space** for the nouniverse with over 60 Nounish guests and 1,400+ attendees from all over the world (attendance never dropped below 100 unique listeners all night and day.)\n* **3 successful Coordinape Rounds** completed, awarding USDC to a total of 12 unique contributing members.

Contests have resulted in over 1,650 unique pieces of user-created Nounish art/content so far, and has spawned at least 3 individual Nounish art collections.\n\n[![nounish-cloud.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/N0Zrqbzh/nounish-cloud.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/R3Q0w1mG)\n\n* Among the winning entries of these contests have been some truly incredible pieces of art, including this Watercolor Cloud Noun by [Jheeart_NFT](https://twitter.com/jheeart_nft). \n    * We helped this artist to create a collection \"With Noun\" using Manifold, and release the piece as an NFT (which sold for 0.69!) and she is releasing more pieces in the same style, [you can see the collection here.](https://opensea.io/collection/withnoun)  \n* **Our show has become an efficient marketing tool** to discover and recruit new artists & builders for Nouns DAO.

This is a very effective way for builders to get attention to their work.\n\n### FOMO Engagement: Just Look At Those Nouns\nThrough increased FOMO engagement, we have helped mint some truly beautiful Nouns (including an incredible triple Void run!)\n\n[![sexy-nouns.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/TPyq8KQs/sexy-nouns.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/CZgfkL3C)\n\n### Using POAPs to Gamify Participation and Give a Platform to Artists\n\nWe have given a daily POAP to attendees of The Noun Square every day since our inception. This is the purest use case for the protocol, and works well for us to incentivize people to attend our Twitter spaces, play FOMO live and participate in our contests. \n\nAdditionally, this has allowed us to feature the art of talented established artists like Ser Noadz, Sam Ellis, SuperTightWoody and Greta Grempllin, as well as giving exposure to talented new creators like [0xAprilia](https://twitter.com/noun_o_clock/status/1555013482222870528?s=20&t=l1iqwV_VBZS7cDVu0b6HNw), [Illustradora.eth](https://twitter.com/ilustradoraeth/status/1556418817244422144?s=20&t=l1iqwV_VBZS7cDVu0b6HNw) and [Leetlestar](https://twitter.com/hapsigmi/status/1556802875111550976?s=20&t=l1iqwV_VBZS7cDVu0b6HNw). \n\nWe also plan to continue to use the data from these POAP distributions in the future to do token-gated raffles and contests that reward past participants and strengthen our community.\n\n## Bonus Things We've Done That We Didn't Even Say We'd Do\n\n* **24-hour Nouniversary Celebration**: an audacious [Twitter Space](https://twitter.com/noun_o_clock/status/1556348069662412802) on the Nouniversary with dozens of guests booked, contests, games and more. \n    * Over 1,400+ unique attendees, attendance never dropped below 100 at any time.\n    * 50+ Nounish guests\n    * Amazing community shared moments.\n* **Nounish NFT collections:** We have helped community members to set up Nounish NFT collections based on their Noun Square contest entries using Manifold. \n* **International outreach:** We have done outreach to international audiences by hosting non-English Spaces on some Saturdays, and making foreign-language channels in Discord with moderation.\n* **Community involvement in DAO governance:** Noun 142 Delegated his Noun to The Noun Square multisig so that we could initiate an Audience Voting initiative. \n    * We invite proposers to pitch their proposals to the audience.\n    * The audience then votes live in our discord.\n    * We then execute the voted on-chain accordingly. \n    * This has been a popular segment, and we look forward to expanding on the experiment in future.\n\n\n## The Future of the Noun Square\nWe hope the above sections paint a clear picture of all the accomplishments our team has achieved over the past 6 weeks, meeting or exceeding all the engagement goals we set for ourselves in Prop 101. \n\nThe Purpose of this Proposal is to ask the DAO to fund our proven team for an additional 5 months, until the end of the calendar year, to do the following:\n\n* **Continue to plan and execute daily Twitter Spaces**: Engage newcomers, Nouners and Nouns community members alike, with informative guests and fun contests that produce a plethora of Nouns-based art and authentic social media engagement.\n* **Continue to organize Contests for our community**: Using data from our trial, we have found that 1-2 weekly contests with larger prizes are both more effective and less administratively onerous compared to daily contests. We would plan to move forward with 1-2 contests per week with prizes ranging from 0.05-1ETH, which will no doubt encourage more thoughtful and skillful entries (while also peppering in smaller contests live on the show for variety.)  \n* **Innovate on contest voting and prize administration:** We have spoken with Nounder Seneca and, if funded, plan to move forward with an implementation of **Prop House** for our contest entries to be voted on weekly, as an alternative to the current system of emoji voting in Discord. \n* **Work with the [Noun O'Clock Web App](https://prop.house/proposal/777) team:** Iterate with the team to ship a product with product-market fit and integrate these clients with our own site and daily Spaces as much as possible. \n\n### Areas of Focus\n\nOur vision for TNS in the next 5 months:\n\n* **International growth:** As we enter a European/APAC friendly Noun O Clock, we want to seize the opportunity to introduce Nouns to these regions of the world even more than we already have been.\n* **Be a leading onboarding funnel to Nouns:** We have seen initial signs that our show is a great vehicle to onboard artists, builders, and future Nouners to the DAO. We want to lean into this and make sure our show becomes a strong funnel into nouns.\n* **Expand to new channels:** We want to explore growth opportunities via new channels like podcast platforms, Youtube, TikTok and Twitch.\n* **The Noun Square as a platform for builders:** We want to keep attracting talent to build on top of our show. Two teams ([NOC nouns client](https://prop.house/proposal/777) & [NOC Onboarding Materials](https://prop.house/proposal/864)) have already won prop house funding to build specifically on top of the Noun Square show, in addition to the previously mentioned artists whose collections have been prompted by our contests, and we hope to see more in the coming months.\n\n### So what does success look like at the end of 2022?\n* Grow our twitter followers from 1,600 to 5,000+\n* Average daily attendance by end of year 200+\n* 5,000+ contest entries\n* International growth: Our goal is to contribute to growing a much larger international noun ecosystem by end of year. We have already started this outreach and plan to continue with more foreign language \"takeover\" spaces on the weekends, and focus on non-English accessibility in Discord and Twitter.  \n\n\n### Budget\n\nMonthly Operations Costs: \n* **Contest Prizes:** 10 ETH\n* **Team Compensation and Administration:** 50 ETH per month, allocated by Committee Coordinape on a Biweekly basis.\n* **Time Period:** 5 months until end of 2022. \n* 5 x 60 ETH = 300 ETH\n**Total Proposal Ask: 300 ETH**\n(Cost of 3 Daily Nouns Auctions for 5 months of daily Nounish multimedia content and organic social media engagement.) \n\n\n### Team\n\nWe will continue with our \"3C Model\" of governance and accountability:\n\n**Core (Founding) Team (Responsible for Execution):**\n\nToady Hawk\nNoun 142\nSer Noadz\n\n**Council (Responsible for Decisions and Daily Direction)**\n\nAubtoshi\nBenbodhi\nSuperTightWoody\nRyanMac21\n!Xargs\nSam Ellis\nMaty.eth\nJoshua Fisher\n\n\n*Members of this committee may rotate depending on timezones, availability, etc. New incoming Committee members from APAC timezones will most probably include 0xigami, Goldy, Mr. Boney, Mintfaced, and more.*\n\n### Community (Talent Funnel for Council)\n\nAnyone in our [Discord](https://discord.gg/VQxv2BFw39) and Twitter communities can join and participate in all our public channels to help with contest ideas, guest ideas, and more, and can apply to join the Organizing Committee at any time. We have forked Nouncil governance with procedures for adding/removing contributing committee members at any time. \n\nThe above organizational strategy (modeled loosely on Nouncil) allows us enough structure to execute on a daily basis, as well as enough flexibility to adapt to new timezones and other challenges as they may arise.\n\n\n## Strategy for North American \"Nouns Winter\"\n\nNOC happening during North American late night/early morning may have some impact on our attendance rate, although we have been attracting a sizable audience from Europe and Asia already (for example, during our recent 24H long Nouniversary Spaces, attendance never dropped below 100 even during NA non-peak hours.) Nonetheless, we think of this as an opportunity rather than a challenge: \n\n### Proliferation opportunity\n* Auction times drifting enable fairer distribution of nouns across the globe. **We think of our show drifting with NOC as giving a fairer opportunity for Noun proliferation outside of the Americas timezones**\n*  We will have the opportunity to **engage with international guests**, and introduce our nounish energy to a new audience. \n\n### Host Recruiting & Scaling Ops\n\n* **We have begun recruiting additional hosts** and administrative helpers from Europe and APAC timezones so that we can smoothly transition into North American night.\n* Several of our Committee members are also excited to continue hosting/attending the show well into the North American night. \n* We are **already pulling in an impressive daily audience from Europe, Australia and Asia** (especially Japan and Korea.) \n* We plan to work with members of NounsDAOJapan, NounsDAO Brazil and GnarsDAO (Australia based) to continue to pull in new viewers and new Nounsfolk even through the North American early morning hours.\n\n\n\n### New distribution channels\n\n* We will begin posting recordings of our daily spaces both on a **podcast server and on Youtube**, so that North American audiences will still be able to listen and interact with our content daily. \n* We will also experiment with doing trial versions of The Noun Square on **Youtube, Twitch, and TikTok Live** to test engagement on those mediums. \n\n### Scaling with systems\n* Our team has created a robust Notion for knowledge management with **Planning Documents, Tracking Databases and Daily Run-of-Show Templates** to enable onboarding of new hosts and contributors as easy and decentralized as possible.\n\n\n## LFG!\n\nWe were funded for a trial and have surpassed all goals and metrics by a large margin, going above and beyond with initiatives such as the 24 hour Nouniversary Spaces. \n\nWe represent a group of committed Nounish builders with a good track record of success, and we are asking for the DAO's trust, as we lean into a very successful concept and continue to improve, grow and scale this new platform centred around the daily Noun O' Clock. \n\nWe believe that in a short time, The Noun Square has become the defacto watercooler of the Nounish ecosystem, as well as an impressive funnel for new Noun owners, artists and builders. \n\nWe are excited by how much more we can do if given a mandate to keep on building throughout the remainder of 2022. \n\n**Thank you for your support, and we look forward to having you as a guest on the show one day soon!**","proposer":"0x5D802e2Fe48392c104Ce0401C7ECa8a4456f1F16","startBlock":15324163,"endBlock":15343873,"executed":true},"votes":[{"support":1,"voter":"0xa903C06BF35286f6d1cDAD25396748353979a44C","numberOfVotes":3,"reason":"⌐ⓝ°ⓒ\nWe vibe at The Noun Square ⌐◨-◨\n\n💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛\n💛💛💛❤️❤️❤️❤️💛❤️❤️❤️❤️💛\n💛❤️❤️❤️🤍🖤❤️❤️❤️🤍🖤❤️💛\n💛❤️💛❤️🤍🖤❤️💛❤️🤍🖤❤️💛\n💛💛💛❤️❤️❤️❤️💛❤️❤️❤️❤️💛\n💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛"},{"support":1,"voter":"0x9a2F6117D1FFa82ad0A2B36f133d476DB5bD55F5","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":2,"voter":"0xb054E7683f26273b4BA7454Df9a71C578506aa01","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":"Love the concept.

By branding and collaborating on Advisry’s official calendar runway show in September, we will introduce nouns to fashion in an illustrious way.\n\n**Why?**\n\nNouns has effortlessly aligned itself with all realms of high art. As a young fashion label, we are aware of the shift in culture and believe the Nouns Glasses logo is the Nike swoosh of web3. We feel it is necessary for Nouns to be represented in the most iconic facet of fashion culture, the fashion runway show.\n\n**Nouns x Advisry Experience**\n\nWhat Nouns is working towards in the future of web3 aligns closely with the overall goals of Advisry. Advisry and Nouns both strive to build communities to give individuals a voice and platform to express themselves and their ideas on a bigger scale. \n\nThe Advisry X Nouns experience involves “In Real Life” events that bring our conglomerates together to communicate the importance of unity and change. Advisry wants to involve web3 in fashion and continue aligning with Nouns on potential future projects. \n\n**How**\n\nTo Nounify the show and after party, we will:\n\n- Provide Advisry X Nouns POAPs to onboard show guests.\n- Provide Nouns gifts for every show guest.\n- Brand Nouns EVERYWHERE at the venue for the show and after party.\n- Include Nouns pieces & looks designed by Keith Herron on the runway.\n- Film a documentary of the process of Nounifying NYFW.\n\n**The Show**\n\nIn September Advisry will be showing their first womenswear collection at New York Fashion Week. The collection titled, “Masculin Feminin” aims to capture gender inclusivity through 32 looks of traditional and nontraditional womenswear. \n\n**Nouns On The Runway**\n\nAdvisry will include Nouns Sunglasses that will be featured in one of the looks in the runway show. Along with this, one of the models will graze the runway with the Nouns Soft Trunk. There will be two Nouns-themed looks in the show.\n\n![nouns soft trunk.png](https://polished-walrus-b42.notion.site/image/https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fsecure.notion-static.com%2F3f9c2296-0f88-4cad-9653-e37319381ee3%2Fnouns_soft_trunk.png?table=block&id=30217e74-922a-4901-9f78-9c2fe4257837&spaceId=aaa84961-448d-41f3-9787-b37867da72d8&width=2000&userId=&cache=v2)\n\n**THE NOUNS SOFT TRUNK**\n\nThe soft trunk design is a reference and ode to custom Goyard and Gucci trunks made for their premier clients. They Screenprint their client’s names and or logos on the baggage to make them custom. The more thoughtful side of the design is the altering of the trunk itself - changing it from wooden frame structure to a more soft leather structure, similar to a luxury duffle. This trunk design is intended to be immediately iconic due to the pure crossover of a nouns logo with Advisry’s monogram print.\n\n- A classical trunk shape & hardware, but no wooden frame - it will be made of vegan leather with gold plated .925 silver hardware - structured so it will maintain shape\n- The classic Advisry checkerboard monogram will be embossed into the leather - the nouns glasses will be screenprinted on the bag\n- Made in Italy\n\n**Venue**\n\nThe show will take place in the *Oculus NYC*, an artistic landmark located at The World Trade Center. We will be the first of many fashion brands to utilize this as a show space, which is on its way to becoming one of the new homes of New York Fashion Week.\n\nThe Oculus NYC is located in one of the most heavily foot trafficked areas in all of New York. The building is packed with many storefronts, an NJTransit & major MTA station hub, and was once even home to a Kanye West music video in 2019.  \n\n![Untitled](https://polished-walrus-b42.notion.site/image/https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fsecure.notion-static.com%2Fce2080fd-6ae6-4d01-b027-ba4995832001%2FUntitled.png?table=block&id=d57f7ed1-c590-4088-8e11-a62f04b37034&spaceId=aaa84961-448d-41f3-9787-b37867da72d8&width=1460&userId=&cache=v2)\n\n![Untitled](https://polished-walrus-b42.notion.site/image/https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fsecure.notion-static.com%2Fd498554e-5c90-4cc2-a6cd-142be2f2c8ae%2FUntitled.png?table=block&id=6aa96ec1-ce6d-4561-ae46-a754bac567bb&spaceId=aaa84961-448d-41f3-9787-b37867da72d8&width=2000&userId=&cache=v2)\n\n**Set Production**\n\n- Dress the runway with Parisian style cafe chairs and tables where guests will be seated\n- Light the show with Parisian style street lamps that are manually operated to highlight models by turning on and off as they walk the runway\n\n**Proposal**\n\n**Fund Advisry to:**\n\n- Occupy the Oculus NYC space for the show and after party\n- Produce all garments and accessories for the show\n- Execute the set design of the show\n- Create collaborative pieces to seed and sell to Nouns new and growing audience of luxury consumers\n- Build out a team to produce, fabricate, style, cast, and model the *Masculin Feminin* Show\n- Brand Nouns throughout the venue using Vinyl, Signage, Video, and more\n\n**Branding**.\n\n- Nouns X Advisry T-shirt collaboration to be gifted and/or sold at the after party\n- Nouns branded drinks at the after party\n- Nouns signage and video being played throughout the venue\n- Nouns branding on all invites and Ads posted by Advisry\n\n**Billboard: a 60’ x 12’ Nouns billboard placed outside of the Oculus, designed by Advisry’s creative director, Keith Herron. This billboard will reach beyond our fashion week audience and be seen by the heavy traffic of tourists and locals walking through the historic Oculus Space.**  \n\nAccording to the City of New York data last updated on June 30 2022, the Oculus has an average foot traffic of 16,000 people per day\n\n**Documentation**\n\nWe want to create a documentary that captures behind the scenes footage of the Nounification of New York Fashion Week! \n\nTelling the story of how an IRL fashion show can be realized with a Nouns collaboration speaks to how valuable, versatile, and functional the DAO is. The documentary would be the first of its kind and a timeless piece in a world where web3 and the high arts will one day seamlessly grow and work together. \n\nWe would work to publish this documentary on a fashion youtube channel like Vogue, GQ, Etc. \n\n*We are interested in working with the creators of **Prop 73, Stoopid Buddy Doc** to film and produce the documentary but have not yet been in contact with them.* \n\n**How does this benefit Nouns**\n\nNew York Fashion Week is one of the most iconic and respected events in the global fashion industry. By working side by side we will transform the view of Nouns as not only having a “luxury” side of the brand with sunglasses and high quality garments, but also having a leg in the always changing industry of fashion.\n\nNouns holders in NYC will have the opportunity to place their name on our guest list for the runway show and all after parties using an alias to keep identities private.\n\nA multi-faceted branding opportunity that not only reaches the show audience but also the city of New York\n\n**Visibility**\n\nWith past coverage from Vogue, GQ, Forbes, WWD, CFDA, and more we believe we can bring Nouns to the forefront of fashion journalism. \n\nThese platforms will put Nouns on hundreds of thousands of peoples radar if not more. Vogue, GQ, and WWD alone average over 5 to 10 million monthly website viewers and have a combined following of over 100 million people on all of their social media platforms.\n\n**Why work with Advisry?**\n\nAdvisry is a fashion, film, and music label based in NYC. Keith Herron, 22 year old founder and designer, began Advisry when he was in 8th grade and has been growing the brand ever since. Keith has sold Advisry to 35 different countries, was awarded the Gucci Changemakers scholarship and was most recently added to the Designer’s Hub of CFDA: a members-only incubator of American Designers joining the likes of Marc Jacobs, Rick Owens, Virgil Abloh, and many more.\n\nLast spring Advisry debuted on the runway at NYFW. In his first live show, Keith designed 37 looks and packed out the venue with over 150 people in attendance. \n\nThe fashion industry is very gate kept. There is no actual way to break through the industry in an official way without working with a brand that has already broken through. Historically, the way brands get the opportunity to be on the official fashion calendar is by spending many seasons producing their own runway shows independent of the fashion calendar, hoping to gain the attention of the CFDA. \n\nThe benefit of collaborating with Advisry is it gives Nouns an authentic introduction and inclusion into the fashion industry. Not only is Advisry an up and coming line making a lot of noise for its unique approach, but the brand has also collaborated on web3 drops in the past.

This will be my testimony and my summation.\n\nJudge: Take the oath.\n\nCourt Clerk: Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?\n\nRoark: I do.\n\nThousands of years ago, the first man discovered how to make fire. He was probably burned at the stake he had taught his brothers to light, but he left them a gift they had not conceived, and he lifted darkness off the earth.\n\nThroughout the centuries, there were men who took first steps down new roads, armed with nothing but their own vision. The great creators -- the thinkers, the artists, the scientists, the inventors -- stood alone against the men of their time. Every new thought was opposed; every new invention was denounced. But the men of unborrowed vision went ahead. They fought, they suffered, and they paid. But they won.\n\nNo creator was prompted by a desire to please his brothers. His brothers hated the gift he offered.\n\nHis truth was his only motive.\n\nHis work was his only goal.\n\nHis work -- not those who used it.\n\nHis creation -- not the benefits others derived from it -- the creation which gave form to his truth.\n\nHe held his truth above all things and against all men. He went ahead whether others agreed with him or not, with his integrity as his only banner. He served nothing and no one. He lived for himself. And only by living for himself was he able to achieve the things which are the glory of mankind. Such is the nature of achievement. Man cannot survive except through his mind. He comes on earth unarmed. His brain is his only weapon. But the mind is an attribute of the individual. There is no such thing as a collective brain. The man who thinks must think and act on his own. The reasoning mind cannot work under any form of compulsion. It cannot be subordinated to the needs, opinions, or wishes of others. It is not an object of sacrifice.\n\nThe creator stands on his own judgment; the parasite follows the opinions of others.\n\nThe creator thinks; the parasite copies.\n\nThe creator produces; the parasite loots.\n\nThe creator's concern is the conquest of nature; the parasite's concern is the conquest of men.\n\nThe creator requires independence. He neither serves nor rules. He deals with men by free exchange and voluntary choice.\n\nThe parasite seeks power. He wants to bind all men together in common action and common slavery. He claims that man is only a tool for the use of others -- that he must think as they think, act as they act, and live in selfless, joyless servitude to any need but his own.\n\nLook at history: Everything we have, every great achievement has come from the independent work of some independent mind. Every horror and destruction came from attempts to force men into a herd of brainless, soulless robots -- without personal rights, without person ambition, without will, hope, or dignity.\n\nIt is an ancient conflict. It has another name: \"The individual against the collective.\"\n\nOur country, the noblest country in the history of men, was based on the principle of individualism, the principle of man's \"inalienable rights.\" It was a country where a man was free to seek his own happiness, to gain and produce, not to give up and renounce; to prosper, not to starve; to achieve, not to plunder; to hold as his highest possession a sense of his personal value, and as his highest virtue his self-respect.\n\nLook at the results. That is what the collectivists are now asking you to destroy, as much of the earth has been destroyed.\n\nI am an architect. I know what is to come by the principle on which it is built. We are approaching a world in which I cannot permit myself to live. My ideas are my property. They were taken from me by force, by breach of contract. No appeal was left to me.\n\nIt was believed that my work belonged to others, to do with as they pleased. They had a claim upon me without my consent -- that it was my duty to serve them without choice or reward.\n\nNow you know why a dynamited Courtland. I designed Courtland. I made it possible. I destroyed it. I agreed to design it for the purpose of it seeing built as I wished. That was the price I set for my work. I was not paid. My building was disfigured at the whim of others who took all the benefits of my work and gave me nothing in return.\n\nI came here to say that I do not recognize anyone's right to one minute of my life, nor to any part of my energy, nor to any achievement of mine -- no matter who makes the claim!\n\nIt had to be said: The world is perishing from an orgy of self-sacrificing. I came here to be heard in the name of every man of independence still left in the world. I wanted to state my terms. I do not care to work or live on any others.\n\nMy terms are: A man's RIGHT to exist for his own sake."},{"support":0,"voter":"0x008c84421dA5527F462886cEc43D2717B686A7e4","numberOfVotes":5,"reason":""},{"support":0,"voter":"0x9a2F6117D1FFa82ad0A2B36f133d476DB5bD55F5","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":0,"voter":"0x66D5527411d821cB513f2D214BBBC0ad73586b35","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0xDCb4117e3A00632efCaC3C169E0B23959f555E5e","numberOfVotes":6,"reason":""},{"support":0,"voter":"0xb054E7683f26273b4BA7454Df9a71C578506aa01","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":2,"voter":"0x3496f3600070CC01d9665d1057F6F39afC0fe149","numberOfVotes":2,"reason":""},{"support":0,"voter":"0x7D81478Ad18ad375e53De6F74F3122F6be3499ca","numberOfVotes":2,"reason":"seems a bit much for a book "},{"support":1,"voter":"0x5D802e2Fe48392c104Ce0401C7ECa8a4456f1F16","numberOfVotes":12,"reason":"Love the builder (Mintfaced) but agree with many that the price tag just feels too high.

I was introduced to Nouns by Euwyn (Noun #122 and #341), and fell enamored with the sense of community I’ve observed so far. Nounish-ness is special, and I’d love to bottle up a bit of this and spread the word about Nouns to larger audience.\n\nThis proposal is for a community-driven, studio-quality animated short film starring a Noun, with a red carpet event in Los Angeles to cap off production and bring Nouns and film community members together to inspire more collaborations.\n\nWith an origin story of falling out of their owner’s laptop - think “Finding Nemo” - the protagonist Noun will be animated in stop-motion style, composited on real footage, and film their own journey home. With the Nouns community involvement at each step, the story will be written to be captivating to a broad international audience across different languages, crypto-native and not. \n\n## Why?\n\nAllow us to introduce you to: The Noun. An animated Noun, fallen out of his owner’s laptop and finding himself lost in the real world. Starting with an animated short, audiences worldwide will watch the charming, adorable, and sneakily snarky Noun overcome obstacles, find and lose love, and much more as he films his journey home. Modernizing the mold of fictional personalities like Marcel the Shell with Shoes On, or Annoying Orange, and inspired by early Pixar shorts, we aim to make the Noun into a well-loved, viral, memeable, sharable character. \n\nA big part of our effort will be involving the community in writing a unique, compelling narrative for the noun. As a storyteller, this is where I’ll be focused. The intimacy of telling his story from his POV, with his phone camera, intercut with 3rd-person footage of his adventures, will build a lasting emotional relationship with his audience that will transfer into future projects, from this team and others. Whether it be longer YouTube videos, a TV series, or even his own feature film, people will follow the Noun wherever he goes — in the world or online.\n\nHis story will be designed to be saturated with clipable, memeable, shareable moments that don’t need context to go viral on their own. However, for the curious viewer, the clips bring them in to a larger narrative designed and produced around a genuine story and loveable protagonist.\n\n## Community-Driven Production\n\nUltimately, we want the character, and the project as a whole, to be completely emblematic of all that is Nounish. Yes, this means quirkiness, humor, personality and spontaneity, but it also means myriad factors and traits we can’t even begin to predict. This is why throughout the entire creative process we will hold bi-weekly town halls to discuss the script and invite members to share their thoughts. The character bio, the general plot, the finished screenplay, design, locations, all of it. We promise to be receptive to feedback, and additionally will host community feedback sessions to ensure our protagonist is as Nounish as can be.\n\nAlong the Noun’s journey, he will inevitably interact with other characters and Nouns in the wild, and while the Noun overcomes loneliness, fear, and anxiety, the story will lead towards an ultimate message of the value of community and collective voice. This will open an opportunity for more creatives to build and expand upon what would effectively become the Nouns Cinematic Universe. Other writers, animators, directors, with their own backgrounds, aesthetic styles, and manners of storytelling, can build upon the framework Noun sets and expand with their own real-world Noun characters and stories.\n\nWe’re not only creating a viral character who will bring attention to the Nouns project, but a platform upon which like-minded creatives can find opportunities to build art.\n\n## Development\n\n\n### Pre-Production\n\n6-8 weeks\n\n- Writing\n- Location scouting\n- Establishing workflow for animation\n- Voice actor casting\n- The casting will likely be the longest part of pre-production. In building a project based around the personality of one protagonist, the casting is crucial. We do it once, we do it right.\n\n### Production\n\n6-8 weeks\n\n- Filming\n- Recording voice lines\n- Animation\n\n### Post-Production\n\n1-2 weeks\n\n- Hiring social media marketing specialist to maximize likelihood of going viral\n- Setting up digital marketing strategy (trending hashtags, etc)\n- Deploying the videos\n\n![Budget Breakdown](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/nouns/original/2X/e/e272bac8a1a6e48b90b3caa34452bb40323cbf8e.jpeg)\n\n\nIt is our goal to create a professional, polished, award-worthy product. As such, we’re going to need a professional team. Above is our outlined 25 ETH budget, covering a worst-case scenario which can promise a perfect result. We will strive to remain under that budget, however, and any remaining surplus will go towards the following, which we hope piques your interest.\n\n## Los Angeles Red Carpet Premiere \n\nAs the Noun character falls into the real world, so to do we wish to bring this to life. To cap off production, we will host a screening event in Los Angeles with a Nouns step and repeat banner, red carpet, and more, inviting members of the Nouns and film community. It’ll be an opportunity to meet the team behind the project, celebrate together, and provide another occasion for the Nouns community to gather and grow.\n\n## The Team\n\nWho are we!? We’re (mostly) recent graduates out of LA and Austin, Texas, trying to carve our way creatively. With backgrounds in literature, screenwriting, film production, animation, and design, we’re coming together to build something not only with catchy style, but with weighted substance. We don’t just want to work with Nouns to make *something* — we believe we can make something *great.*\n\n**Fedja Celebic.**\nProducer, Writer, Director\n\n[Fedja](https://www.linkedin.com/in/fedja-celebic-853522199/) is a USC graduate with a degree that spanned all mediums of writing and a Masters in Literary Editing and Publishing, and has found his creative satisfaction in screenwriting and producing.

A white-labeled Nouns browser app will be used for scanning the patch to claim the NFT, as well as for authenticating and verifying the garment owner and manufacturer.* \n\n*Dopamine, as the first Nouns-fork to incorporate with fashion, would like to include Nouns’ drop as one of a select few to incorporate Dopamine’s new web3 streetwear technology (”Non-Fungible Streetwear”). Nouns streetwear will be sold both at the event and online.*\n\n*Funds requested are 62-82Ξ, with 85% of the primary sales revenue going to the Nouns treasury.*\n\n![Noggles](https://i.imgur.com/6dxtUlx.jpg)\n\n# Introduction\n\nDopamine is thrilled to collaborate with Apenoun to design a limited-supply Nouns-branded collection of NFT-bundled streetwear. The collection will feature ~500 Nouns streetwear garments, each of which will be patched with a cryptographic NFC chip connecting on-chain to a Nouns-branded NFT that can be authenticated and claimed through a white-labeled Nouns browser app. The branding and experience for this drop will be Nounish end-to-end, and will fully incorporate Dopamine’s new “Non-Fungible Streetwear” technology.\n\n[Dopamine](http://dopamine.xyz/) is the first Nouns-fork to incorporate fashion, with the mission to empower Web3 projects, NFT artists, and collectors through a community-owned ecosystem for Non-Fungible Streetwear. We are crypto natives with a passion for streetwear culture and web3 technology, aiming to bridge the gap between these two worlds. \n\nOriginally inspired by Nouns’ creative governance and community model, we want to become an incubator for up-and-coming streetwear designers and NFT artists and recreate the “Nouns Virtuous Cycle” for the budding web3 streetwear industry. \n\nWith this collab we’re aiming to push the Nounish culture forward and proliferate the Nouns meme and brand across the Metaverse and into mainstream pop culture using a powerful vehicle for hype: streetwear.\n\n# Designs\n\nDopamine will work closely with Apenoun to design the garments, which will feature the Noggles and the Nouns slogan “One Noun, Every day, Forever.” Around 500 pieces will be made in total, featuring a combination of t-shirts, hoodies, and various other apparel. Quality-wise, this drop will have a premium feel reminiscent of brands such as Fear of God or Acne Studios, leveraging entirely cut and sew assembly. In terms of past experience, Dopamine’s design team has worked with the likes of Billie Eilish, Young Thug’s Spider, and Siberia Hills. \n\nIn addition to the merchandise design, each garment will feature a Nouns clothing patch covering the NFC chip used to connect to its bound Nouns NFT, which itself will include a digital 3D design of the garment along with additional digital accessories (see next section). Finally, the patch itself will also be capable of triggering an AR hologram of the underlying digital design.\n\n![1](https://i.imgur.com/kLfrWi5.jpg)\n\n![2](https://i.imgur.com/kJYBPNF.png)\n\n![3](https://i.imgur.com/63NDcOM.jpg)\n\n![4](https://i.imgur.com/9eqWRdI.jpg)\n\n![5](https://i.imgur.com/FkUXpDq.jpg)\n\n![6](https://i.imgur.com/Axt3asS.png)\n\n![7](https://i.imgur.com/7sRU8u4.jpg)\n\nWe are continuing to iterate with Apenoun on additional designs while ensuring the entire drop remains cohesive.\n\n![8](https://i.imgur.com/31n8Mwe.png)\n\n![9](https://i.imgur.com/p8teGhg.png)\n\n# Non-Fungible Streetwear Technology\n\nDopamine is creating a decentralized fashion technology platform for authenticating and sharing a new form of chip-microchipped streetwear that we call **“Non-Fungible Streetwear”**.\n\nAt the core of each Non-Fungible Streetwear piece is a **physical-bound NFT (PNFT)**, an NFT *forever bound* to the garment through an on-chain registry that uses chip-generated ECDSA signatures for resolution, whose media represents a 3D model of the physical streetwear piece. \n\nBy scanning the garment’s patched chip with Dopamine’s white-labeled browser app, garment owners will be able to claim the PNFT, authenticate collection and manufacturer details, and view digital renditions of their streetwear in a 3D-like wardrobe. On top of this, PNFTs may be composed with arbitrary numbers of other digital assets, such as NFTs representing brand-related digital art, music, or perks. \n\nBelow, we dive into more detail on the customization process, on-chain connectivity layer, and scanning flow as it relates to Nouns’ curated Non-Fungible Streetwear collection. \n\n### Customization Process\n\n![wip10](https://i.imgur.com/gErPzVi.jpg)\n\nThe following assets will be required for the Nouns’ Non-Fungible Streetwear collection:\n\n- **Nouns 3D PNFT Design**\nThe design file for the PNFT, which in this case will be a 3D digital rendition of the Nouns physical garment bundled as a GLTF file.\n- **Nouns Accessory Media Files**\nAdditional digital media files may be provided to build accessory NFTs. These could be anything from Nouns Art Basel POAPs to complementary Nouns digital avatars. Unlike the PNFTs which are forever bound to their garments, these accessory NFTs may be attached and detached on-chain to allow for composability with any Non-Fungible Streetwear pieces.\n- **Nouns PNFT Collection Specs**\nOwnership attribution for the Nouns’ Non-Fungible Streetwear will revolve around a custom ERC721-compatible Nouns PNFT collection with a fixed supply of ~500, reflecting the total number of garments distributed. Besides the aforementioned accessorizing, additional specs may be added here, such as collection-wide metadata or whitelisting support.\n\n### On-Chain Connectivity\n\n![11](https://i.imgur.com/zs3fcSV.png)\n\nConnection between Nouns streetwear garments to Nouns PNFTs will be entirely on-chain, and will involve three major components: \n\n**NFC Chip**\n\nDopamine NFC microchips are machine-washable ~30mm round, 1mm thick chips capable of signing messages. Scanning the patched chip will enable chip-signed attestations (secured at the firmware level) to be passed through the on-chain registry to the Nouns browser app for authentication and claiming.\n\n**Chip Registry**\n\nAn ENS-like on-chain registry mapping chip ids to PNFTs will be used for connecting physical and digital worlds together in a truly decentralized manner. Included in each record will be a pre-registered IPFS cert provided by Nouns (e.g. an attestation signed by Nouns Deployer) and the chip manufacturer. \n\n**Nouns PNFTs**\n\nNouns PNFTs will act as the virtual representation and authentication interface for the Nouns’ streetwear garments. Unlike most NFTs, which are normally only owned by a user EOA, these will include two forms of ownership attribution - one involving the garment owner, and one involving the paired chip itself. \n\n### Browser App\n\nThe three above components allow the white-labeled Nouns browser app to process claims, verifications, and transfers in a way that is truly 100% decentralized. Below, we outline at a high-level how claims and normal scans work:\n\n**Claims:**\n\n![12](https://i.imgur.com/KLykF7M.png)\n\nDopamine's Non-Fungible Streetwear uses a physical-first standard for claiming. This means that recipients of the Nouns’ Non-Fungible Streetwear collection will first get the physical garment, and then scan the patched chip using the Nouns browser app shown above to have the ownership attribution of the PNFT assigned to them. For security reasons, only addresses of those which have purchased the collection pieces (either online or live at Art Basel) will be able to invoke the initial claim.\n\n**Scans:**\n\n![13](https://i.imgur.com/uWHAKW2.png)\n\nAnyone with an NFC-enabled smart device will be able to tap their devices on the Nouns’ chip patches to view details regarding garment owner and authenticity through the Nouns browser app. In addition, these scans will showcase the PNFT media assets in an interactive 3D wardrobe-like environment, along with any bundled accessories.\n\n## Dopamineland @ **Art Basel Miami**\n\nThe Nouns x Dopamine drop will feature at our Art Basel Miami multi-day event “Dopamineland” as part of a select group of 5 partners representing the best and the brightest of web3 culture and meme power. \n\nThe Nouns area will be a fully Nouns-branded immersive experience featuring on-site “activations” giving users direct interaction with the Nouns bundles and their physical-digital features.\n\nNouns Non-Fungible Streetwear will be available for purchase on-site and online via credit card or ETH. For online orders, shipments will be handled through Shopify.\n\n## Nouns x Dopamine Bundle Cost Breakdown\n\nSupply: ~500 (TBD)\n\nCosts: ~82Ξ \n\nSupply: ~500 (TBD)\n\nCosts: ~62Ξ  - 82Ξ \n\n- Curation Fee (incl. Garment Design & Development, Smart Contract Development, 3D Model Design, NFT Design): ~2Ξ\n- Garment Production Costs: ~20-25Ξ\n- Microchip + embedding: ~5-10Ξ\n- Authentication & AR Integration: ~10-15Ξ\n- Packaging: ~10Ξ\n- Shipping: ~10-15Ξ\n- Operational costs: ~5Ξ\n\nFunds will be converted to USDC upon transfer to avoid impact from ETH volatility. On project completion, any remaining ETH will be send back to the Nouns DAO treasury.\n\nPrimary Sales: 85% to Nouns DAO Treasury, 15% to Dopamine\n\nSecondary Sales: 5% to Dopamine, Nouns to set secondary fee\n\n## **Timeline**\n\n- September: Design & Development\n- October - November: Production\n- December: Art Basel Dopamine Marketplace Launch\n\n## **Team**\n\nAs mentioned the Dopamine team will work closely with Apenoun to deliver this drop and ensure Nounish branding and experience from start to finish.\n\n![14](https://i.imgur.com/eBt6zGb.png)\n![15](https://i.imgur.com/Oppo3rb.jpg)\n\n![16](https://i.imgur.com/640yaEu.png)\n\n","proposer":"0x91dCCAA260CC4616E1a6e6b693DB7207C5E42937","startBlock":15375953,"endBlock":15395663,"executed":true},"votes":[{"support":1,"voter":"0x91dCCAA260CC4616E1a6e6b693DB7207C5E42937","numberOfVotes":2,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x75Ee6eb3d8DAcf41eE2e5307090B197D3E1Cca6E","numberOfVotes":17,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x2e32935bfD5B2718f99BC8FDf8B37c16811f7D97","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x9a2F6117D1FFa82ad0A2B36f133d476DB5bD55F5","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x2f5Bfd77dDf8d810fae1CFDaA2af19871f3F96C2","numberOfVotes":2,"reason":"I'm glad the team took feedback and came back with an improved prop with actual examples of possible clothing designs. ⌐◨-◨"},{"support":1,"voter":"0xC8598168d8475133de3150Eff9B0cE27fB9B038d","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0xce6404642bB08f897FCe5317C1349656ca44f2D8","numberOfVotes":13,"reason":""},{"support":0,"voter":"0xDCb4117e3A00632efCaC3C169E0B23959f555E5e","numberOfVotes":6,"reason":"Find the discussion here: https://discord.com/channels/954142017556979752/1009859488146264155"},{"support":1,"voter":"0x0B3CF56E7dF3BB3Fb7201fFcD96d279b05DDd2E3","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0xC46Db2d89327D4C41Eb81c43ED5e3dfF111f9A8f","numberOfVotes":2,"reason":"🏌️‍♂️🏌️‍♂️🏌️‍♂️"},{"support":1,"voter":"0xa903C06BF35286f6d1cDAD25396748353979a44C","numberOfVotes":3,"reason":"⌐◨-◨"},{"support":1,"voter":"0xE8D24bE3ABF6EB27B800F752A969D3C1E84fD401","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":0,"voter":"0x2573C60a6D127755aA2DC85e342F7da2378a0Cc5","numberOfVotes":47,"reason":""},{"support":0,"voter":"0x3496f3600070CC01d9665d1057F6F39afC0fe149","numberOfVotes":2,"reason":""},{"support":2,"voter":"0xb054E7683f26273b4BA7454Df9a71C578506aa01","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":0,"voter":"0x5ca6a2e5f53a48616d4ead87fF6034fc032D4722","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":"I do not see this providing demonstrable value to the DAO insofar as a source of revenue nor a means of proliferation."},{"support":1,"voter":"0xE3064d830c35119a83402636816444446Ac72d36","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0xcC2688350d29623E2A0844Cc8885F9050F0f6Ed5","numberOfVotes":14,"reason":"⌐◨-◨"},{"support":1,"voter":"0x6937db08Db977C734Fc1cE884D2915b05147F845","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":"The Nounsfolk have spoken.  ⌐◨-◨"},{"support":0,"voter":"0xA86882277E69FbF0a51805cdc8b0a3a113079E63","numberOfVotes":2,"reason":""}]},{"prop":{"id":133,"description":"# SharkLabs -- A nounish incubator by SharkDAO\n\n![enter image description here](https://snapshot.mypinata.cloud/ipfs/bafybeigy7tbnqavbqmgyu4k2lfil5s25vtiuuptchaibfhez4s6vdntanq)\n\n_Collectors piece for our charity “Sharkfrens”, by Messhup_\n\n----------\n\n**TLDR**\n\nSharkDAO is requesting 99 ETH to fund Shark Labs, a Nounish incubator program designed to ship Nounish projects.\n\n----------\n\n# Introduction\n\n\nAs holders of 6 Nouns, Shark DAO members have created and pushed several proposals to Nouns over the past year, becoming an important and reliable contributor to the Nouns ecosystem. Additionally, some of the most active Nouns contributors got their start in SharkDAO.\n\nSuccessful proposals:\n\n-   Prop 8 - FOMO Nouns\n-   Prop 12 - Perpetual Glasses to Kids In Need V2\n-   Prop 20 - Nouns Stories\n-   Prop 56 - FUN Noggles Stage 2\n-   Prop 68 - Nouns Esports\n-   Prop 70 - Nouns CC0 Story Foundations & Development\n-   Prop 104 - Free Glasses for Kids v4\n-   Prop 116 - Monthly Nouns Comic\n\nThe time has come to raise our contributor game to the next level by deploying Shark Labs, an open creative laboratory and incubator focused on supporting Nounish creatives in developing and submitting deliverables to Nouns on a regular basis, led by core SharkDAO contributors.\n\n# What is Shark Labs?\n\nShark Labs is a cohort of SharkDAO contributors that are actively working to support, develop, and ship Nounish projects. SharkLabs will operate under 3 main outlets to achieve our goals:\n\n-   **Art**\n-   **Development**\n-   **Media**\n\nSharkDAO has a unique identity as a more accessible avenue for participation in the Nouns ecosystem. We attract many builders, artists, and creatives, with more to come as a result of our upcoming PFP project. The mission of Shark Labs is to implement a structure in which we can more efficiently utilize and support contributors in deploying projects that add value to Nouns with a regular cadence.\n\n----------\n\n![_15.png](https://snapshot.mypinata.cloud/ipfs/bafkreibexnxvx74cecnj2mgfwnl7zqg2x7trkxbpvxv3he3rcu3evcj4za)\n\n_Excerpt from the Shark Street Comic #2, by Maty_\n\n----------\n\n# Outlet Details\n\n-   **Art Reef:**  Art Reef: An art laboratory supporting emerging and established nounish creatives in addding content to Nouns lore and creating cc0 art for both SharkDAO & Nouns DAO.

It’s a wild, novel genre that’s inspiring a new generation of creators, artists, and storytellers. \n\n### Click image to watch Blu present the proposal\n[![Image alt text](https://img.youtube.com/vi/ktZaS52qyYA/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktZaS52qyYA) \n\nWe’re a team of two with a shared passion for bringing avatars and worlds to life. We want to help bring Nouns into the 3D metaverse with our unique storytelling and world-building skills. We propose a XANADU x NOUNS collaboration consisting of two parts:\n\n### Part One - Nouns Episode of Xanadu \nWe would create a mega-episode of Xanadu where Blu, the hero of Xanadu, teams up with Nouns in an action-packed deep dive into the Nouns Universe.\n\nThe episode features Blu questing through Planet Nouns desperate for the Nouns help to save him from a posse of intergalactic gangsters. To satisfy the bounty on his head, Blu must submit a winning proposal to Nouns DAO which kicks off a wild escapade through the Nouns City Center, the historic Nouner Capitol building, and the Nouns Underground. Along the way, Blu meets a master Noun who gives him a crash course on NounsDAO, how it works and why it’s awesome — education disguised as Hollywood quality entertainment. But it doesn’t stop there…\n\n![Alt Text](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/nouns/original/2X/e/e4951cf151fd7bfb2f983a7dbcb7ed901ce5614d.gif)\n\n### Part Two - CC0 Nouns Toolkit\nUnlike a Hollywood feature where all the creativity and work vanish after the movie’s made, all of the Nouns assets created for this episode will be crafted into a Nouns World Toolkit that will live on in an innovative and powerful new way — in the hands of the community, available CC0.\nThis is more than a simple library of assets…\n\nBecause Xanadu is built in a game engine (Unreal Engine 5), it’s a story world that can be cinematic, interactive, gamified, live-streamed, or experienced in VR. So, armed with this massive toolkit of AAA animatable Nouns characters & pre-lit, animated environments — complete with how-to guide books & tutorials created by us — the Nouns community can inhabit a Noun for VTubing, Zoom calls, or create cinematic content, marketing materials, NFTs, or even build a Nouns VR experience, game, or metaverse. It’s our hope for this to become the beginning of a dynamic Nouns repository that grows over time and is contributed to by other builders. (Full list of Toolkit deliverables below in Extra Details)\n\n![Alt Text](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/nouns/original/2X/1/137fa14e33c6b60152c5c4700e5f77bb82b719f1.gif)\n\n### How does this benefit NounsDAO?\n- **The Episode** — Exposure for NounsDAO in a novel, powerful narrative – with analytics & insights (average results per episode: 2.7M impressions, 321K views, 12K watch-time hours)\n- **The Toolkit** — 3D tools that enables Nouns creators, creations, remixes with other IPs, and continued proliferation of Nouns to a new degree.\n- **Our Vision** — Inspire creators with the episode, enable creations with the toolkit, and catalyze a cohort of Nouns as VTubers and next-generation virtual avatars.\n\n### Community \nWorking directly with the Nouns community is key for this project in several ways:\n1. **Help choose what Nouns derivatives to feature** such as LilNouns, SharkDAO, skateboards from GnarsDAO, and art pieces from prop house. We love the extended Nouns community want to infuse this thriving ecosystem into the Toolkit and Episode.\n2. **Help define the 3D style of the Nouns characters and environments**, as well as how Nouns express themselves using motion capture and animation.\n3. **Help choose Nouns characters to be featured in the episode.** Some Nouns will be chosen for story purposes but we’d love the community to vote on what other Nouns get featured. Those Nouns holders will have the option to voice & motion capture their own Noun (assuming there’s dialogue).\n\n### The General Timeline\n* Phase 1: **Concept & Design + Episode Writing.** starts immediately (est 2 months)\n* Phase 2: **Asset creation.** Starts as concepts complete (est 2-3 months) Will overlap with Phase 1\n* Phase 3: **Launch Beta Repository.** Nov 2022 Assets are made available as they are created.\n* Phase 4: **Episode Production Starts** Jan 2023 *When assets are finished (est 3 months)\nEst Episode completion March 2023\n\n### Toolkit Repository Timeline\n* Phase 1: **Launch Beta Repository.** Nov 2022 Post assets as they become available\n* Phase 2: **Create Beta How to Docs & Tutorials.** (these will roll out starting in Dec thru March)\n* Phase 3: **Launch final Toolkit Repository.** March 2023\nWe will be sharing fun BTS & asset creation along the way via YouTube Shorts, TikTok, and Instagram content.\n\n### Our Ask & Budget Breakdown \nWe are asking for a total of $307.2K USD (192E @ $1600)\n* Toolkit Concept Art & Design — $20,480 (12.8ETH)\n* Toolkit 3D Modeling & Texturing — $99,040 (61.9ETH)\n* Nouns Character Modeling & Rigging — $33,440 (20.9ETH)\n* Toolkit Assembly & Episode Production — $141,280 (88.3ETH)\n* Toolkit publishing & maintenance — $12,960 (8.1ETH)\n\nThe proposed budget + 15% to cover volatility will be converted to USDC immediately, and everything in excess will be retrurned to the DAO. If, due to high volatility, there is insufficient ETH to cover the proposed budget (307.2K USD), a second proposal will be made.\n* Total: 192ETH * 1.15 = 220.8ETH\n\n---\n\n## Extra Details\n\n### The Nouns World Toolkit Repository \nThe CCO repository will consist of the cast of Nouns characters and environments made for the episode. Everything will be set up in the Unreal Engine (Free game engine software) and we're going to include all the scenes, cameras, lighting and animation from the episode which means, the Nouns City center will be alive with ambient animation and amazing cinematic lighting.  Additionally, the scenes from the episode will provide a starting point for making new content that looks amazing. All the Nouns characters will be rigged and ready for motion capture style animation (Both face and body similar to how Blu is setup in Xanadu).  For those with the right gear, this means you can instantly puppet any of those Nouns for V-Tubbing or creating your own cinematic content.  We're also exploring 'off the shelf' webcam mocap solutions (Cheap or free but body motion quality not as good as the expensive mocap suites) to include, if possible, to make inhabiting the nouns characters more accessible.  This would also allow using Nouns for Zoom calls, etc. \n\n### Nouns World Toolkit Details\n* 12 Hero Nouns (Face & Body fully rigged for motion capture)\n* 24 Secondary Nouns (Body fully rigged for motion capture. Minimal to no facial animation)\n* Beautifully lit and fully animated environments:\n* Nouns Downtown City Center (exterior, like Time Square)\n        * Buildings reflecting the Nouns extended family\n* Nouner Capitol Building (Exterior & Interior) \n* Nouns underground city / town (Exterior)\n* Noun masters Dojo (Exterior & Interior)\n* General modular city assets *for building new structures\n* General nounish props & furniture \n* Nouns transport vehicles\n* Wide Establishing model of the Nouns Planet\n* Guide Book & Tutorials on using the Toolkit to create Vtuber & Cinematic content \n\n### Technical Details\n* Unreal Engine 5 project - CC0\n* Assets performant in Real-time (Streaming)\n* Assets performant in VR\n* Fully animated Hero scenes from episode included as examples\n        * All hero Nouns characters ready for motion capture (Face and Body)\n\n### Production Team\n* Art Direction, Episode Writing & Directing\n* Producer\n* Lighting\n* Motion Capture\n* Animation\n* Cinematography\n* UE4 Integration & Tooling\n* VFX\n* Actors\n* Editing\n* Music\n* Sound Design\n\n### Episode Details\n* 20-30 minutes\n\n### About Xanadu & beyond\nThe heart of Xanadu is its zany stories and wild characters, but its soul burns to bridge and play in other universes. Thus Blu wants to help bring to life the budding spectrum of web3 Pop-Cultures from Nouns, cloneX and BAYC to small burgeoning Avatar projects backed by talented teams or individuals. All so they can collide on a bigger, more wild stage, with bigger, more wild crossover stories! Think Ready Player One and the Marvel Universe but creator content style!\n\n### FUN BONUS IDEA: Wild Story Twist!\nBlu’s adventure with the Nouns will live on beyond this episode in a ‘first-of-its-kind’ melding of entertainment & reality; After this episode airs, Blu’s fictional proposal (The one he formulates in the episode with help from the Nouns) is actually a real proposal that he submits to the Nouns DAO… and the outcome of that proposal dictates Blu’s future storyline – Will his proposal be good enough for approval, or will Blu have to evade the gangsters and find another solution to survive?\n\nIf you haven’t seen Xanadu yet, check it out [Xanadu on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/xanaduBlu) and our original proposal teaser.\n[![Image alt text](https://img.youtube.com/vi/xJTpIGK3tUc/0.jpg)](https://youtu.be/xJTpIGK3tUc) \n\nThank you,\nCory & Stephen","proposer":"0x1A4370fdd7173d0a41FF7C63a8e0249479BA0225","startBlock":15464278,"endBlock":15483988,"executed":true},"votes":[{"support":1,"voter":"0xE8D24bE3ABF6EB27B800F752A969D3C1E84fD401","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x2f5Bfd77dDf8d810fae1CFDaA2af19871f3F96C2","numberOfVotes":2,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0xC8598168d8475133de3150Eff9B0cE27fB9B038d","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x4754b7e3DEde42D71d6c92978f25F306176EC7e9","numberOfVotes":31,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x91dCCAA260CC4616E1a6e6b693DB7207C5E42937","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x008c84421dA5527F462886cEc43D2717B686A7e4","numberOfVotes":5,"reason":"The road to Xanadu is the road less traveled"},{"support":1,"voter":"0x2e32935bfD5B2718f99BC8FDf8B37c16811f7D97","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x203cC9B81C53Fd649BD575E0E19925DD1a2A54da","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x7Dd5B92716542AB2442030Df6d87cEc437A51Ded","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0xBd7Dbab9AEb52D6c8d0E80fCeBdE3af4CC86204A","numberOfVotes":6,"reason":"nom nom Xanadu ⌐◨-◨ "},{"support":1,"voter":"0x2573C60a6D127755aA2DC85e342F7da2378a0Cc5","numberOfVotes":48,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x1fF2875cd548EEAe6d22f26bae2D72a50fd143c7","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0xDCb4117e3A00632efCaC3C169E0B23959f555E5e","numberOfVotes":6,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0xA1c0b11B86A46885B87c7ed68b91FAa0C349e1cD","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x7D81478Ad18ad375e53De6F74F3122F6be3499ca","numberOfVotes":2,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x1A4370fdd7173d0a41FF7C63a8e0249479BA0225","numberOfVotes":2,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x5D802e2Fe48392c104Ce0401C7ECa8a4456f1F16","numberOfVotes":13,"reason":"Incredible high-effort proposal, can't wait to see the outcome.

We think it would be pretty sweet if the Nouns came in as title sponsors of this inaugural event*)\n\n### **DESCRIPTION**\n\n- Becoming the Nounding Partners / Presenting Sponsors of NFT Seattle creates an opportunity for the Nouns to build relationships with the Pacific Northwest’s Web3 community and solidify the Noun meme in the foundation of these new relationships.\n- As we establish Seattle as a hub for Web3 innovation, we'd love for the Nouns to come in at the ground level and cement the meme as an integral part of Seattle’s Web3 ecosystem, positioned for maximum and lasting brand exposure. The Web3 community is still growing in Seattle so the probability of reaching new people (vs people that already know about the Nouns) is likely higher here, than most other major US cities. Plus Seattle's technically inclined demographic lends itself well to everything the Nouns stand for, though people here are still warming up to the whole idea of NFT's.\n\n### **WHAT IS NFT SEATTLE**\n\n- NFT Seattle is the first event catering to the broader Web3 community in the Pacific Northwest (Portland, Seattle, Vancouver, BC).\n- The vision behind NFT Seattle is to establish Seattle as a hub for Web3 innovation & connect the growing community in the Northwest. We want to unite people in Seattle to educate & expose them to the opportunities & possibilities that Web3 brings to creators, businesses, artists, and communities.\n- This event is mainly targeting the Web3 curious and as such, has a heavier leaning towards education.\n- NFT Seattle will take place from 9/30/2022 - 10/1/2022 in Seattle at several venues including Block 41 and the Seattle NFT Museum (the worlds first NFT Museum).\n\n### **WHY SHOULD NOUNS BE INVOLVED & WHY IT MATTERS?**\n\n- NFT Seattle presents a unique opportunity for the Nouns to proliferate the Nouns meme and imagery (think, Noggles in downtown Seattle) across a region that is still trying to figure out Web3 but is on the cusp of a major Web3 breakout. A region that has already cemented itself as a global hub for technological and cultural innovation, with everything from Amazon/Microsoft to Starbucks and many more having been birthed here.\n- As the first Web3 event in the Pacific Northwest, NFT Seattle will draw people in from Portland, Seattle, Vancouver BC and will lean heavily towards education plus fostering deep, meaningful connection between brands, thought leaders and other attendees. Early data suggests the audience will be a healthy mix between the Web3 curious, and those that are pioneering in the space.\n- This event also creates a perfect opportunity for an IRL Noun meetup, for Nouns that are local to the region to come and engage with the local community while providing *Nouns on the Ground* an opportunity to execute their existing IRL events strategy, in a new untapped market. Also, hoping to partner with the Nounish marketing team to up-level the Nounishness of this activation if the prop passes. (Initial conversations have been started).\n\n### **THE BREAKDOWN**\n\n- **Presenting Title Sponsor of NFT Seattle** (”NFT Seattle presented by the Nouns”). Nouns branding will be prominently featured at the Event and the official After Party.\n    \n \n![](https://i.imgur.com/jDWDkc8.png)\n\n\n    \n- **Live Art Premier** that is nouns-inspired and incorporates the noggles, showcased by local high profile NFT artist [Jaiden ‘Jasti’ Stipp](https://www.instagram.com/jastidesigns/), the 16yr old that made over a million selling NFT's.\n- As a way of thanking the Nouns for being a founding event partner for NFT Seattle, this commemorative art-piece will become a permanent fixture at every NFT Seattle annual event, an exclusive benefit only being extended to the Nouns. We’ll store this piece for future use, or the Nouns can opt to claim it for use at other IRL events.\n- **Evergreen Video Content** to drive meme awareness and exposure: 2 daily sizzle Reels to be shared upon completion of each event day specifically highlighting the Nouns, and 1 sizzle Reel showcasing the creation of the custom mural. Video content to be produced by local media partner Brandtegic.\n- **Nouns Branding exclusively featured on each String Backpack** provided to all attendees upon entry. Nouns stickers and swag will also be included in each swag bag (we'd need help designing the stickers).\n    \n![](https://i.imgur.com/poa1pxT.jpg)\n\n\n    \n- **Nouns Branding prominently featured on Social, Website, and Emails** that will be widely visible to all attendees, the public, and reviewed by various news outlets and media partners. We just recently kicked off a regional PR campaign, the Nouns imagery will be added to the the forefront of all marketing materials associated with the event as a title sponsor.\n\n- **Fireside chat with a Noun**, an optional speaking opportunity where a designated Noun can share a bit about how the Nouns continue to play a key role in the advancement of the overall DAO ecosystem via the prop house model or a deep dive into cc0 NFT's, using Nouns as a use-case.\n\n\n### **THE ASK**\n\nThis is a title sponsorship for NFT Seattle, and cost breakdown will be as follows:\n\n- $65,000 USD ~ 40 ETH (calculated at 1 ETH = $1,600)\n    - 10 ETH - Towards venue costs + event production team (labor)\n    - 16 ETH - Towards A/V production + other venue related expenses\n    - 10 ETH - Towards PR campaign, advertising, event marketing, videographers and video editing. (This includes printing graphics for all Nouns signage and marketing materials)\n    - 4 ETH - Live painted Nouns inspired mural/art piece by Jasti (reusable at future events)\n    \n    ***N.B.** This cost also factors in event admission for Nouns that wish to attend (up until a pre-negotiated number) as well as an optional booth activation, if there are nouns on the ground available to man it.*\n    \n\n### **WHY SEATTLE**\n\n- Seattle is an emerging market in Web3 with events just starting to take place. (ETHSeattle, blockchain events, and now NFT Seattle)\n- Starbucks is entering Web3 and launching an NFT collection ([CoinDesk](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/05/04/starbucks-teases-web-3-platform-in-nft-announcement/)) and it’s in good company among other major brands with a substantial presence in Washington who are either ALL-IN or dabbling in Web3- Salesforce, Meta, Microsoft, Amazon, Google, Apple.\n- Besides SF, Seattle has more tech talent than any other city in the country ([425 Business](https://www.425business.com/news/greater-seattle-no-2-in-tech-talent-report/article_37815015-8e5d-58f2-81fa-593715c7f695.html)) and it’s also the country’s most desired location for people aged 18 to 24 ([Bankrate](https://www.bankrate.com/real-estate/cost-of-living/seattle-wa/)), making the city an ideal place for Web3 brands to establish a presence in order to attract and retain top talent.\n- 75% or more of PNW Angel Investors are interested in Web3 companies and founders. ([Madrona Venture Group](https://www.madrona.com/angel-investors-pacific-northwest-directory/))\n- Seattle is the US’ primary gateway to Asia, the best city in America for outdoor activities, the 13th best city to live in overall, and the eighth-best city for raising a family. ([Patch.com](https://patch.com/washington/seattle/seattle-ranks-high-2022-best-places-live-list))\n- There is a growing list of startups in Seattle building crypto, blockchain, and Web3 technologies such as Irreverent Labs, CoinMe, Nori, ArcBlock, Bittrex, CypherD, DragonChain, Luxor (Source: [GeekWire](https://www.geekwire.com/2022/a-list-of-startups-in-seattle-building-crypto-blockchain-and-web3-technologies/))\n\n### **THE TEAM BEHIND THE PROPOSAL**\n\nWe’re a team of builders from diverse cultures and backgrounds, united by the goal of advancing the adoption of Web3 technologies.\n\n- **Tessa Mero** ([@tesssamero](https://twitter.com/tessamero)) - VP of Developer Relations at Appwrite, over a decade of experience organizing events.

We seek to impact various causes by addressing problems that affect our society. Mucho Love aims to cultivate a community in which all members feel part of something bigger than themselves, making them feel nounish.\n\n### How does Mucho Love work?\n\nMucho Love was created by 5 founders, who wear many hats and structured what it is today. We plan to expand the team next year to escalate further and establish more specific scopes. Currently, we have over 30 community members eager to volunteer for the causes we are aiding.\n\nMucho Love currently works on a 9-step system.\n\n1. **Ideation:** planning and deciding on activities.\n2. **Outreach:** contacting the organizations/places, writing letters/petitions, and setting up dates/places.\n3. **Chronogram/Requirements:** Itinerary, step-by-step program to be performed on events, pre-event checklist, proofreading.\n4. **Quotations:** quotation of each item or service (3 quotations from different companies per item or service)\n5. **Payments and Negotiations:** negotiating with businesses, establishing formal relationships, explaining MUCHO LOVE, and paying for services/items.\n6. **Pre-Event:** revision of the pre-event checklist, volunteer count, and Zoom meetings with volunteers and multimedia team to prepare for the event.\n7. **Event Day:** role call, transportation to the event, itinerary execution, feedback.\n8. **Post Event:** post-event multimedia management and feedback from participants.\n9. **Documentation:** establishing the framework to replicate the current working system by documenting for the continuous improvement of the project.\n\n### How does this benefit the DAO?\n\n**Charity** is a recurrent activity/topic within the Nounish ecosystem—that’s why we decided to start a nounish volunteering community that makes sure to proliferate Nouns with the values and vision it represents. **Mucho Love aims to become one of the Nounish platforms regarding community service, social work, and volunteering campaigns.** Mucho Love’s activities will all be shared through Twitter and Instagram, appealing to the masses and expanding global Noggle adoption.\n\nMucho Love is starting operations in the Dominican Republic but aims to develop a model that is replicable internationally. Also, if needed, we want to be able to travel to any part of the world to aid any team who needs help developing charitable efforts in their respective communities. \n\n### Goals\n\nOur goal is to **establish the foundation of Mucho Love as a future Decentralized Non-Profit Organization** **that will allow us to replicate the model in any part of the world.** The structure/model created will be available for any team that wants to make charitable efforts in their respective communities. We also want to keep collaborating with established Nounish projects (like BigShotKlim’s pins and Messhup’s books) that can contribute with donations to proliferate Nouns further.\n\nMucho Love will carry out during the 4-month extension events/donations/activities among the following:\n\n* Hospital Robert Ried\n* Hospital Hugo Mendoza\n* Red Misericordia (Orphanage)\n* Hogar Escuela Santo Domingo Savio (Orphanage/School)\n* Escuelita Café con Leche (Orphanage/School)\n\n*2 institutions have not given a definitive yes; therefore, they are subject to change.\n\n### Pilot results\n\nThe pilot successfully helped children feel joy despite going through difficult moments. We also showed what the Noggles are and what they can do. People fell in love with Messhup’s books and BigShotKlim’s Noggle pins. Children that used glasses felt even more identified with the Noggles. I can genuinely say that the pilot was a success; the Noggles were well received, and we helped out 300 children and their parents while proliferating Nouns, love, and optimism.\n\n300 Children received 300 Nounish goodie bags containing:\n\n* Messhup’s coloring book (300 total)\n* Crayola box (300 total)\n* Diapers (1440 total)\n* Stickers (600 total)\n* BigShotKlim’s Noggle Pins (100 total)\n\nVideo recap:\n\n\n#### [MUCHO LOVE ](https://twitter.com/mucholovedr/status/1565689757740535808)\n\n[@mucholovedr](https://twitter.com/mucholovedr/status/1565689757740535808)\n\nSpreading ❤️ with ⌐◧-◧ *⌐◧-◧ are used to protect children’s identity https://t.co/PWvO4nhZYA\n\n### Budget\n\n24 ETH to be distributed in the following way:\n\n* 19 ETH for donations\n* 3 ETH for photo/video crew\n* 1 ETH for t-shirts and hats for volunteers to use during the events\n* 1 ETH for a storage facility\n\n*The team has not received any compensation, nor is it interested in getting compensation until we go on-chain again by the end of the year.\n\n*If any Nounish Project creator wants to collaborate with their products/ideas feel free to reach out to me.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/FGPF9af.jpg)\n\n","proposer":"0x75Ee6eb3d8DAcf41eE2e5307090B197D3E1Cca6E","startBlock":15498796,"endBlock":15518506,"executed":true},"votes":[{"support":1,"voter":"0x4754b7e3DEde42D71d6c92978f25F306176EC7e9","numberOfVotes":31,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0xa903C06BF35286f6d1cDAD25396748353979a44C","numberOfVotes":3,"reason":"⌐◨-◨ \nI love that this proposal has grown through the ranks of prop house and is becoming something bigger.

A big part of my Solidity education was forking the Nouns contract back when we were at Noun #3. So I’m super thrilled to present an idea that integrates Nouns into what I've been working on for 2 years, & can contribute to the Nounish goal of spreading the Nouns meme far & wide.\n\n----\n\n**TLDR:** We are Internet Game. We host massive web3 game shows with thousands of players and blue-chip NFT prizes. Our Season 2 is coming up next, hosted by gmoney, and we’d like to re-skin one of the games to feature Nouns, as well as educate our players about Nouns with a video prior to the game.\n\nBefore we get into specifics, we’ll share a bit more about who we are and why we’re qualified to propose this…\n\n## What is Internet Game??\n\n[Internet Game](https://internet.game/) is Squid Game meets NFTs. We create live, interactive game shows that anyone can play at home with hyper-simple, yet dangerously fun mini-games. 60% of buy-ins go to blue-chip NFT prizes, all voted on by the community in Discord.\n\nIn March 2022 we launched our Internet Game: [Season 1](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ut4uEdKyydQ3lFZFoGIMUWpsqXQh_ZE3NugP6UGIE-c/edit#slide=id.g13ad4d9e874_0_0). 8000 players minted $2.2M in NFTs to play. We then purchased $1M+ in NFT prizes as voted on by the players, including Bored Apes, Mutant Apes, Doodles, Azukis, CloneX and many more.\n\nThe best way to fully understand how our seasons work is to[ look at this case study](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ut4uEdKyydQ3lFZFoGIMUWpsqXQh_ZE3NugP6UGIE-c/edit#slide=id.p).\n\nInternet Game: Season 2 “Bear Market Battle” launches on September 12th. Season 2 features 6 brand new games taking place between September 12th and 23rd. The entire event is hosted by the infamous gmoney & comedian Leah Lamarr. Gmoney will appear as a full 3D version of his cryptopunk by being rigged up in a high-fidelity motion capture suit, and will then be superimposed on an XR stage (picture a gigantic LED screen & floor) next to Leah.\n\n## Season 2 Trailer:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lr3GruECkk\n\nHere’s a preview of what that looks like from the podcast we did with gmoney on the XR stage with him in the co-cap suit:\n\n![|624x323](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/R2_yJv7VgaZlSyENj-pB3qwG82IdRuM9S1i94XuvPAeTjmR2gD5Hnqiz-vE7NWVMMAFtEY4ZTSFat4h1jg9DTlxnubOXHtnfWIhRnJIAmcmypoVrmrmuGvGc5RIU2Hw-z3xxbllb31NhvAAY-eXIk8w)\n\n## The Opportunity: Nouns Game + Video in Season 2\n\nInternet Game Season 2 is made up of 6 mini-games that take place over the course of two weeks. Each game runs for 24 hours.\n\nThere is an opportunity to fully brand the third game, currently titled as “The Last Spaceship”, and transform it into “The Last Noun”.\n\nThe game itself is similar to an old school Asteroids / Galaga space shooter, but with an original take on how you move around the space. We think the 2D arcade aesthetic is a perfect match for the Nouns art. Both the main character as well as the enemies would be Nouns:\n\n## The Opportunity: Nouns Game + Video in Season 2\n\nInternet Game Season 2 is made up of 6 mini-games that take place over the course of two weeks.

If desired, we could include a trailer / explainer / hype video for Nouns in that video. This would need to be provided by Nouns DAO.\n\n**Additional opportunities during Season 2:**\n\n* Including Nouns and/or Lil Nouns in our prize pool\n* Skinning the entire Internet Game tournament page during “The Last Noun” game to be Nouns-branded\n* Upon the launch of the game, post a write up on our social platforms (Twitter/Discord) to educate our audience on Nouns DAO and the Nouns mission & mechanics\n\n## Our Ask:\n\n**ETH Sponsorship:** Nouns DAO would contribute 20 ETH to Internet Game Season 2. The sponsorship would be split to further contribute to the prize pool and cover operational expenditures incurred by Internet Game.\n\n## Proposed Timeline & Next Steps\n\n* Engage in discussions to answer any questions derived from this proposal\n* Gain approval to transform “The Last Spaceship” into “The Last Noun”\n* Announce partnership with Nouns DAO for Season 2 including the donation to the prize pool\n* Complete redesign of the tournament page and game and showcase to Nouns DAO for feedback\n* Launch “The Last Noun” Game on September 16th, along with the optional pre-game video\n\n## Long-Term Opportunity: Nouns Custom Casual Game\n\nWe we would love to continue the relationship and build a fully custom game for Nouns that can live on in perpetuity. The game would be co-created by the DAO and Internet Game to provide a unique experience that allows consumers to connect with the Nouns brand in an interactive way. Casual gaming is a juggernaut of an industry due to its accessibility (ease of learning), low effort requirement, and repeat value (easy to hop in and out of) it provides. We see a Nouns Game as a way to engage the general population in a highly scalable and interactive way all around the world. Details on this longer-term partnership opportunity can be submitted through a separate proposal.\n\n---\n\n*Thank you for reading!

SuperTightWoody and Papaya will create a platform and ingest processes where anyone can create, export and contribute CC0 Nounish songs, stems, samples, sounds effects and more.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/96a5gtJ.png)\n\n# The Problem\n\nThere is currently no Nouns audio aesthetic, and no environment for it to flourish. There are no sonic logos, sounds or songs that have a consistent use case in the Nouns world. Nounish creators of apps, videos, games and beyond have nowhere to turn for audio. \n\nNounish creators have to source their own audio, often out of their own pocket while being forced to manage limited use rights.\n\nAll of this makes brand consistency/recognition difficult and next to impossible. Sonic logos, sounds or songs are a core part of any brand.  \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/VN0FNJY.png)\n\n\n# Our Solution\n\n**nounsounds.wtf**\n\nWe will create a robust website that will act as a hub for all things related to Nouns audio. This will include an easy to use music “PLAYground” to build a unique Nouns song for your project, a repository of samples/sounds/songs and a robust roadmap with processes and structure, allowing our environment to grow.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/UevPiIZ.png)\n\n---\n\n# The User Experience\n\n## **Homepage**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Z53wdaT.png)\n\nOn the homepage, the latest Noun Sound will be displayed along with the Noun it generates!  **This, and all Noun Sounds, will be available for free use and CC0**.\n\n How does it generate this Noun Sound you might ask?  Let’s head over to the…\n\n## **PLAYground**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/pwDMdY5.png)\n\nThe visual Noun will be generated via the PLAYground tab.  \n\nIn this area, a song is split into its different tracks. Here, one of the 10 songs created for Nouns will be selected.  Each song will contain 5 variations per instrument. Each instrument will correspond to a Nouns layer whose assets will be randomly generated when the page loads. \n\nRefreshing the page or hitting the “Randomize” button will randomly select a new SONG and new set of LAYERS.  Every time you create a new Nouns Sound, a unique new Noun will be born to accompany it!\n\nPut together your favorite song tracks for your project and…VOILA!  You now have your own unique Noun Sound.\n\n[![](https://i.imgur.com/kAFMtLi.png)\n](https://vimeo.com/738442849/e3cdaf3d87)\nWATCH VIDEO: https://vimeo.com/738442849/e3cdaf3d87\n\n## **Sounds**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/9DU37V1.png)\n\nIf you want to grab any of the full songs, stems, loops, samples or sound effects by themselves- this is the place to go.  Easily filter these via metadata and get to creating your Nounish multimedia! \n\n# How Does This Proliferate Nouns?\n\n***Sound*** is the backbone of any cohesive brand and multimedia creation.  This CC0 resource will assist in the production of music, apps, games, videos, social content, sonic branding and more- all revolving around Nouns.  As we work along side Nouns DAO in the future, a self sustaining library of high quality audio will fill a void for creators across all mediums of creative content. \n\n# The Team\n\nWith 20+ years of music production and engineering experience, **SuperTightWoody** is a Grammy Nominated music producer.  Having works featured on major label albums, TV shows, movie trailers and television commercials.  In the Nouns space, he has created the theme song for the Nouncil along with theme songs for The Noun Square Twitter spaces (and the “soundboard” for TNS).  As a Nouncil and TNS member- he is very much looking forward to expanding his contributions into the Nouns space.\n\n**Papaya** is a software engineer with 15+ years of experience known for his attention to detail. He has worked on numerous NFT Collections, tools and Defi protocols. He loves building unique experiences for web3 communities and developers. \n\n# Timeline\n\nThe creation of everything laid out in this first proposal will take 3 months to complete from proposal approval.\n\n# Proposed Funding\n\n72ETH for deliverables + timeline. \n*Signers will be SuperTightWoody and Papaya for multisig wallet 0xE8cF782Bb4aCB9000fae76bA940295CA988DE7Be*\n\n---\n\n# Deliverables\n\n**This Proposal: First Audio Library + Infrastructure**  \n\nOur first proposal is to create the first Nounish audio library, a website, an easy-to-use tool for builders to create songs, and laying out the workflows for onboarding new music makers into the system processes.\n\n- *A fully functional Noun Sounds website with user friendly audio interfaces*\n- *10 CC0 Noun Sounds songs (+ 5 variations of each instrument for the PLAYground)*\n- *3 Nouns sonic logo stings*\n- *20 bleeps, bloops, swooshes and more for apps and games*\n- *All songs, stems and individual samples page available for download*\n- *Twitter account and Discord for building the Noun Sounds community*\n\n---\n\n**Next Proposal: New Tools + Bring on other musicians**\n\nOnce this infrastructure has been built and our ingestion flow for new audio is set, it’s time to grow independently.\n\n- *Create Noun Sounds DAO*\n- *Start developing system to Fund DAO through the sales of generated Noun Sounds NFTs.*\n- *Create pipeline for onboarding new musicians via sounds submissions + legal processes*\n- *Create professional VST instruments that music makers can use in the DAW of their choice, to create an audio palette that allows total freedom while keeping brand cohesion*\n- *Explore the use of AI and other technologies to push the envelope of what is possible*\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/etJbiGT.png)\n\n## Additional Links:\n\nwww.supertight.co\n\nwww.soundcloud.com/supertightwoody\n\nwww.soundcloud.com/nounspoap\n\n## Proposed Transactions:\n\n1. 0xE8cF782Bb4aCB9000fae76bA940295CA988DE7Be.transfer(\n 72 ETH\n)\n","proposer":"0xcC2688350d29623E2A0844Cc8885F9050F0f6Ed5","startBlock":15506668,"endBlock":15526378,"executed":true},"votes":[{"support":1,"voter":"0xa903C06BF35286f6d1cDAD25396748353979a44C","numberOfVotes":3,"reason":"⌐◨-◨\nSonic branding is huge and is something I feel will add immense value to the DAO.

Woody is a Grammy-winning producer and imho Nouns is lucky to have someone as talented and passionate as him who is interested to create a music platform like this for our community. \n\nAlso, the video proposal was novel and really well produced. Woody and Papaya (dev)  have executed on every single project I’ve seen them work on in the toadz and nouns communities and I am confident this project will be no different. \n\n**airhorn**"},{"support":1,"voter":"0xdB7f66F3D53A6A0EC43a49C7B6713e1bd3bd1383","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":"Let me hearrrr the all the ⌐◨-◨ soundssssss"},{"support":1,"voter":"0x2e32935bfD5B2718f99BC8FDf8B37c16811f7D97","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x9a2F6117D1FFa82ad0A2B36f133d476DB5bD55F5","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0xDCb4117e3A00632efCaC3C169E0B23959f555E5e","numberOfVotes":6,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0xBa5a04047DF2CD3F25Cb0054952D4aea0BaBEF95","numberOfVotes":0,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0xdC68ff3e2Ccf723eBa0A33959dE70406a176be95","numberOfVotes":0,"reason":""},{"support":0,"voter":"0x8D86DF61da1EEfa281D263c47C77629A6F9F2c3a","numberOfVotes":0,"reason":""},{"support":2,"voter":"0x05b8312F545ce7daAE10AAE93AEa375D366bf4b5","numberOfVotes":0,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x79438224Bc21b0E6B45ECF9F8caADfBdB874DedD","numberOfVotes":0,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0xE3064d830c35119a83402636816444446Ac72d36","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0xcC2688350d29623E2A0844Cc8885F9050F0f6Ed5","numberOfVotes":14,"reason":"\"Big giant yes.\" \n\"Awesome video.\"\n\"Nouns garage band!\"\n\"Love love loveeeee this project and idea!!!\"\n\"This is great on so many levels, presentation is spoot on and the concept is excellent\"\n\nNothing but positivity about this proposal can be found anywhere in Nouncil channels.

WHAT IS THIS PROJECT?**\n___\nDesigned for maximum NOUNish-ness, these colorful 3” tall mini figures are meant to be a fun, low cost and non-crypto-based entry point into the world of “NOUNs.” Nounish Friends will be packed into colorful mystery boxes and presented in eye catching counter display cartons which are found in shops worldwide.\nProp 72 funded with 20ETH to take this project from initial idea, through countless iterations, to the current designs & prototypes. We have communicated updates weekly on the [Discord here](https://discord.com/channels/849745721544146955/973957832015761428) and have had many conversations on [Discourse here](https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/proposal-nounish-friends-nouns-town-collectible-figures-and-more-by-bigshottoyworks/967/42?page=3&fbclid=IwAR2b6AnS2-xKAbn0eja5dL0k1LCufZM4v_nT5NbJXzZ_ZWWb5FEo_PIxly8), gathering feedback from over 50 comments to arrive at the final designs we’re proposing today. \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/mJ5emSS.jpg)\n\n___\n**II. PROJECT DEVELOPMENT COSTS:**\n___\n**CURRENT STAGE:**\n - **Engineering:**  tooling masters, paint masks, production molds, Packaging, Final branding, box and display box design and dies: $45K ***(one time cost)***\n - **Manufacturing:** $53K for 10K pcs \n - **Logistics/warehousing:** $29K\n - **Marketing, project management & B2B & B2C sales:** $40K for 6 months. This involves sample photography,press, targeted social media engagement, onboarding  and follow ups, potential partner onboarding and communications. This includes unexpected sample creations and air shipping for events such as Art Basel, Dcon, NFTNYC and other opportunities world wide while the mass production run is being produced.\n - **TOTAL ASK:** $167K USD\n\n**PAYMENT SCHEDULE:**\nPayments to be broken down into 3 milestones as follows: \n - **35% upfront** ($58,450 USD)\nPreproduction deposit for further final development of graphics, packaging templates, tooling molds, paint molds, and final samples.\n - **35% on Milestone 1** ($58,450 USD)\nDeposit for mass production deposit once tooling test shots and painted counter sample approvals,\n - **30% on Milestone 2** (50,100 USD)\nFull balance paid out once production passes testing. QC inspection and is ready to ship to our warehouse by sea.\n\n**PAYMENT DETAILS**\n - **GNOSIS SAFE**\nETH will be sent to a 2/3 Gnosis Safe with the following signers:\nBigshot Klim - 0xd25912007EBC2527d4ED9DC536f928E550b0f02C\nJoshua Fisher - JoshuaFisher.eth\nJoel Cares - JoelCares.eth\n\n - **ETH -> USD CONVERSION**\nCalculations done on 9/14/2022 at $1,600 USD / ETH\nProject Cost = $167,000 USD = 104.38 ETH\nVolatility Buffer (10%) = 10.44 ETH\nTOTAL ASK = 114.82 ETH \n\n - **PROCEDURE**\n   - A 10% buffer was added to the ask to account for volatility in ETH prices prior to conversion.\n   - Upon recieving the funds Gnosis Safe operators will immediately convert ETH to USDC to cover total Project Cost. The USDC will be held in the safe and released to Bigshot Klim when Milestones are completed.\n   - If for any reason there are excess funds (ETH remaining  after conversion, milestones not hit) any unspent funds will be returned to Nouns DAO.\n   - If the value of ETH falls sufficiently before conversion and this value no longer covers project costs another proposal will be submitted to cover the difference. \n\n - **TRANSACTION**\ntransfer 114.82 ETH to 0xA04D191Ae755c442B5e4a0ea10136b7B0354cC6a\n\n___\n**III. FUTURE STEPS**\n___\n\nOur 10,000 physical toys will be utilized for both sales and giveaways for maximum reach and value. We believe that both are important aspect of this proof of concept model moving forward:\n\n - 10% -1,000 toys(100 sets) allocated to community members and other Nouns initiatives like Nouns OTG, Rose Bowl and Art Basel Miami etc. Final production Toys will be allocated and shipped from our warehouse (worldwide approx shipping/handling cost $35 per case of toys) \n - 9,000 units to be sold at SRP $14/toy, or approx $7 wholesale + shipping. Portion of the sales will be used to develop series 2 and put forth in a proposal if the project is a success. \n - Option for DAO allocated additional quantities from this edition at $7/unit \n - Option to re-order at lower unit cost ($5-6/unit) in a future run.\n - Option to create unique colorways & revised single-unit packaging at lower unit cost.\n - A collectible card with a POAP is included with each toy. Use TBD, but it will help with future engagement and retain customer attention.Collectors and fans could receive digital goodies, participate in games, contests or win prizes from our NOUNWORKS shop, and/or have access to unique experiences for POAP holders only. Goodies and prizes can be things in our shops or future items from the community based on the promotions and future partnerships and collaborations(TBD) based on Nounish partners and collaborations.\n\nIt is imperative that we expedite manufacturing so that we can have product ready for public introduction and review at Designercon in November 18-20 2022 (10X20 Booth booked), Art Basel in Miami in December, and possible availability for distribution at Rose Bowl (Jan 1, 2023) with Stoopid Buddy Studios. We can support global meet ups with products as well as some blank figures for local artists to paint.\n\n\n\nAll of the items ship from a central location in USA so the marketing and proliferation logistics are perfectly aligned. These steps, including ongoing press and social media support, are crucial to any project of this scope and everything has a price. Since we have multiple ongoing projects with NOUNs and plan many more, we want to be as efficient as possible with our time as well as resources.\nWe are excited to create and distribute the very best  Nouns toys! We have built out a model that is scalable for large-scale runs in the future after this concept is proven.\n","proposer":"0xcC2688350d29623E2A0844Cc8885F9050F0f6Ed5","startBlock":15549135,"endBlock":15568845,"executed":false},"votes":[{"support":1,"voter":"0xC8598168d8475133de3150Eff9B0cE27fB9B038d","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0xa903C06BF35286f6d1cDAD25396748353979a44C","numberOfVotes":2,"reason":"⌐◨-◨ \nI’m a big fan of Klim’s toys and noggles.

In June, the 1st international NFT event in Brazil took place in the city. Gathering renowned Brazilian artists, collections of different styles and lectures about web3, NFTs and DAOs, NFT Rio showed the potential of the Brazilian market.\\n\\nThe Nouns DAO featured as one of the main collections during the event. [After the approval of proposal 98](https://nouns.wtf/vote/98), [@beautyandpunk](https://twitter.com/beautyandpunk), [@leoclark](https://twitter.com/leoclark) and [@fabioseva](https://twitter.com/fabioseva) did a great job spreading the noun culture at the conference.

The instructor explains what are “the secret crypto words”, how they can “control magic internet money”, and how anyone - even kids - can earn, use or store such money.\\n\\n**b) NFTs:** the instructor shows attendees how digital wallets can hold other digital stuff. A series of these valuable things have been scattered through the Skate Cuida Institute (QR codes linking to a minting page). A treasure hunt leads attendees to earn their first NFTs.\\n\\n**c) DAO:** the instructor shows a site where they can use their NFTs as tickets to join a club. He tells them there is a proposal there where they can vote for a prize that will be distributed either to half the “club”… or to all of its members - depending on how they vote it. The instructor reveals the results (awarding a prize in crypto to every participant) and teaches basic concepts in cooperation and game theory. He tells the audience the workshop was sponsored by a “club”, too - NounsDAO - that collaborates online to do cool stuff in the real world. And incites attendees they can do the same via the club they now belong to.\\n\\n**d) Skate & Lunch:** to wrap things up, Bob Burnquist invites the kids for a ride on the Institute’s track, then **food and drinks** are served for all.\\n\\nWe plan to bring 30 kids in each workshop. The goal is to **introduce 120 people to crypto and NFTs** via Nouns DAO.\\n\\nThe end goal is to find a format ([presentation here](https://www.canva.com/design/DAFHzoOmwAE/OhifeRzHPUSLD7X1YLORVQ/view?utm_content=DAFHzoOmwAE&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link&utm_source=publishpresent)) that can be replicated in other communities in a cost-effective way.\\n\\n**The workshops will be conducted by guiriba, a member of Paradigma Education**.

Most of the amazing projects that Nouns funds need help telling their story, and video is the best way to do so.\n\nIt is safe to assume that without the videos we published, Nouns DAO would have missed the opportunity of amplifying the stories of these wonderful projects. \n\nWith video, we are able to tell a much deeper and colorful story and evoke much more emotion. We believe this must be 10Xed to recruit more builders to help the meme proliferate. \n\n## The Nouns Funnel\n\nWe think of builder & community onboarding as a funnel: \n\n\n\n* **Top of Funnel**: People who heear about Nouns from a friend, stumble upon a Nouns project in their city, enjoy a piece of nouns art on twitter etc. \n* **Middle of Funnel**: People who become curious to understand what Nouns are, want to learn how to get funded, or want to join the community.\n* **Bottom of Funnel**: People who are ready to submit a proposal, buy a noun (or nounlet), or to join the community or a sub DAO.\n\n\nIn the next 6 months we want to focus on the **Middle of the Funnel**. We want to help explain what Nouns are to the world and get many more people noun-pilled. \n\n**Why focus on Middle of Funnel first and not Top of Funnel?**\n\nThe majority of people that have heard of Nouns do not really grok what it is, never-mind all the potential builders outside the NFT bubble that we are missing out on because it’s too esoteric to dive in to. In reality, almost no one gets what we’re doing, and it’s impossible for them to have a vision for Nouns.\n\nThe hurdle to understand what Nouns is and how to interact with the community is absurdly high for someone not native to our ecosystem.\n\nIt’s imperative that there’s quality consumable content out there that helps people **not only understand what Nouns is doing but be inspired to join in**. What we need is social media channels (eg. YouTube and Instagram) that have a significant catalogue of content you can just sit and consume. \n\n* We are going to try to answer questions that are not easily answered today like:\n\t* **“So what does nouns actually do and stand for?\"**\n\t\t* This is a branding exercise, this is key for our work to answer.\n\t* **“What is Nouns actually to me?”**\n\t\t* The answer is not NFTs, or a DAO (that is just infrastructure), it's an open source brand that you can be funded to build on (or build on permissionlessly). It’s an energised and broad community. It’s a movement. We need to demonstrate this through our videos.\n\t* **“What’s a nounish concept / proposal?”**\n\t\t* Current way to understand this: read hundreds of proposals on nouns.wtf/vote, tally their results, investigate if they were “successful” or not, if the dao likes them, analyse all this data… etc. What if instead they could watch a handful of nounish videos that show the things we’re proud of?\n\t* **“How do I get funded?”**\n\t\t* Videos about this will be hugely valuable, currently it takes a lot of effort to understand this. Our top priority here is to make a few videos focused exclusively on getting funded via Prop House and then other videos about the other ways as a whole, and individual videos on specifics (on chain, nsfw etc.)\n\t* **“Can it be any cultural domain?”**\n\t\t* Here are some screenshots from version 1 of our intro. We will continue to experiment and iterate with ways to tell this story all the time. This is hugely important to be understood if we want to experiment in every vertical.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/xeVv9Yh.jpg)\n\n## What we will deliver as part of this prop\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/VfTyQw4.gif)\n\n\n### Nounish across all social networks\n\nWe will spend the next 6 months churning out high quality video content about Nouns and its builders. \n\nWe plan to work on all major Social Media networks. We have started building a following on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/nounish) and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/thats_nounish/). We will also invest more cycles into building out our [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100082280520913) & [TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/@thats_nounish) presence. \n\nBut our main focus will be on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/nounish), where you can expect our channel to become the easiest way to get into the Nouns rabbit hole and come out understanding all the key concepts of the DAO, as well as learn about the most inspiring projects being built on the protocol.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/mJGFJA6.jpg)\n*Our YouTube channel will become a video learning hub for everything nouns-related*\n\n### Videos about the most inspiring proposals\n\nThere are so many amazing stories to tell about nouns-funded projects that can get so much more depth with good video content covering them. \n\nHere are some of the proposals we would love to make content about! \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/8t1RQ4Q.gif)\n\n**LONG FORM Candidates (not exhaustive)**\n* Rose parade / Stoopid Buddy\n* E Sports\n* Nouns Fashion: Nouns Brand & Dopamine & Danit Peleg & Madhappy\n* Xanadu\n* Prop House\n* Dustin Ep 2\n* Free Glasses Ep 2\n* Edible Nouns: Moonbeans + Nouns Coffee\n* Children's Book\n* Luxury Glasses\n* NounWorks: Fun Frames, Pins, etc.\n* The Wizard's Hat\n* Sofubi Dolls\n* The Noun Square\n* Nounish\n\n**SHORT FORM Candidates (not exhaustive)**\n* Mucho Love\n* John Hamon\n* Noundry\n* Nouns front ends\n* Nouns Brazil\n* Nouns Comics\n* CC0 Spacebank\n* Bidder POAP\n* Goat Club / Memes\n* 3D Nouns\n* iOS App\n* Coloring Books\n* Super Bowl commercial\n* Murals, posters, art around the world\n\n\n### Nouns Explained (bitesized & long-form)\n\nWe want to make it easy for anyone to understand Nouns and the DAO. And specifically, we want to help onboard potential builders. \n\nWe will create a suite of high quality videos explaining the key concepts of Nouns.\n\nSome of the concepts we would like to produce videos for:\n* What is Prop House and how to get funded\n* What can you build on Nouns?\n* What is Noun O'Clock\n* What is FOMO and how does it work\n* What is CC0?\n* How do props get funded?\n* Where to start with Nouns DAO?\n* How does the Nouns auction work?\n* What happens when you join Nouns DAO? (so you joined Nouns DAO... what next?)\n* How does voting (governance) of Nouns DAO work?\n\n## Who are we\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/HNkWdjf.jpg)\n*142 & Goldy*\n\n### [142](https://twitter.com/1fortytwo)\nNoun-pilled marketer/product/growth person.

They’re experts in making tricky things happen, and believe that clever, complex, and wonderful ideas need nurturing from beginning to end. So they script, design, shoot, animate and finish projects in-house. They have worked across campaigns for world class brands including Adidas, Coca Cola, Toyota, Target, and Sesame Street.\n\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/7CKKsk5.jpg)\n*Goldy, Haley, and John*\n\n\n## Our Team\n* **142**: Lead / Growth / Builder Relations\n\t* 142 has built & marketed products that have grown from 0 to 100s of millions of users. He has led marketing teams in multiple successful startups. He loves identifying trends early and telling about them to the world. Working on Nouns is a perfect fit for 142 as he thrives most at the intersection of art, community, and tech. \n* **Goldy**: Lead / Creative Director / Editor\n\t* Goldy is an Oscar shortlisted filmmaker with over a decade's experience as a commercial director known for striking style and experimental techniques. Goldy joined Pixel as a partner in 2017. His obsession with Nouns has evolved from an odd quirk to a passion that has changed Pixel’s trajectory.\n* **John Gavin**: Creative Director / Editor\n\t* John is the Co-founder of Pixel and has run the business for 16 years. He’s a storyteller, known for his polished, design-driven projects. His practice blurs the lines between animation, technology, and design. John is a hardcore space-enthusiast who mixes up a mean negroni. He has been noun-pilled by his own work on Nounish (now the proud owner of a pair of Nouns Vision glasses in classic red).\n* **Haley Polacik**: Executive Producer\n\t* Haley has over 15 years experience producing film shoots, post production, and animation. As an award winning Exec Producer and Partner at Pixel for the past decade her skills and knowledge are essentially boundless. Haley’s skills even extend to being the best at fill-your-glass-up-as-high-as-possible-without-spilling-it which, in a studio rife with completely ridiculous competitive games, is no small feat.\n* **Meline Samson**: Producer / Editor\n\t* Meline is an impassioned storyteller, and lover of cinema. For her it’s all about the harmony between the narrative and aesthetic. She brings her french elegance and eye for details to the table with 10 years of experience as a producer she knows how to make things done with accuracy and kindness. As a frenchy living in Australia she is the ambassador of cheese ‘o clock at Pixel. \n* **Guy Franklin**: Director / Editor (part time)\n\t* Guy loves big ideas that seem a little scary at first. He’s a specialist in visuals with movement, colour and stories that explore humanity. He’s very comfortable on both the tennis court and the d-floor.\n* **Rebecca Moore**: Producer (part time)\n\t*  Bec is the organisational heart of Pixel. She manages the studio, produces, copywrites, makes a sweet charcuterie platter. With a background in film and creative writing, and a masters in Arts Management, Bec combines fierce organisation and creativity in he role as producer at Pixel. Aside from being a multi-tasking kween, she also sings in an a cappella group and has a Nouns musical percolating in her brain just waiting to be unleashed.\n* **Liam Gordes**: Editor (part time)\n\t* Liam has been directing and editing for screen for the past decade, ranging from short films to web series, and TV commercials.  Liam is a big believer in the power of collaboration.\n* **Dylan Hornsby**: Editor (part time)\n\t* Dylan is educated in marketing but has honed his craft as a filmmaker over the past decade, creating award winning shorts films, online content, and TV commercials. Creative problem solving is a sport for Dylan.\n* **Hiring**: Social Media Admin\n\n## Steering Committee\n\nWe will form a 3-person steering committee to help us deal with strategic dilemmas, get feedback on our work, and help us get expert advice on social media growth strategies.\n\n4156 has graciously agreed to be on this committee.

Instead, the Noundry evolved into a collaborative experience — a festival — where artists from around the world came together to inspire and build upon each other's ideas, using Nouns pixel art as a canvas to unite around.\n\nThe artwork we eventually added to the Nouns Descriptor contract resulted from a group effort and would not have been the same without the participation of the larger community.\n\nWith this proposal, we want to acknowledge that the collaborative, explorative side of the Noundry is as vital as the outcome and hope to set an example for upcoming Noundrys.\n\n## Compensation\n\n### Community compensation\n\nWe think community compensation is best left to the community to decide.

Total ask of 142.69 eth.**\n\nWe believe that Noundry compensation is more than a box-ticking exercise. Pixel art is part of who we are; it's in our bones, and adding new pixels to the Descriptor contract is a big deal. It's an opportunity to celebrate nounishness, reinforce our culture, and create new traditions.\n\nWe want the Noundry to become a continuous event, a new tradition, and a significant driver of Nouns proliferation within artistic circles. In that light, the compensation outlined in this proposal is not just about the work that was completed, but also about future signaling.\n\nWe think one of the most exciting possible outcomes of the Noundry would be if every artist in the world aspires to put their artwork into the Nouns contract (and by extension, the public domain). And while high compensation may not be the primary motivator, it can help initiate the right feedback loop and create the breeding ground needed for future Noundrys to thrive.\n\n## Compensation\n\n### Winner compensation\n*[https://nouns.wtf/vote/125](https://nouns.wtf/vote/125) (Integrate 8/8 Anniversary Art)*\n\nNoundry Season 0 winners are compensated per winning trait.

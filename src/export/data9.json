[{"prop":{"id":400,"description":"# Sell Some Treasury Nouns\n\n## TL;DR\nCurrently, there are only four nouns available for purchase on open markets. Herein, I propose to sell some treasury nouns at prices above the fork0-BV price. This initiative would provide individuals with the opportunity to acquire nouns from Season 1, offer the DAO a chance to expand the Nouners community, in addition to daily auctions, and generate additional capital for proliferation or burn.\nA committee of five trusted members will manage listing of nouns via a 3/5 multi-sig.\n\n## Description\nThis proposal aims to replenish the treasury and secure capital for further proliferation activities. Nouns had historically limited market availability, however there are indications that nouns are in demand; for example, Noun8 was sold for 49 ETH. Now that we have a treasury with lots of rare and beautiful nouns, I propose listing 15 nouns on open markets. This will help the DAO to refill the treasury and also attract new Nouners who appreciate the art, culture, and value of NounsDAO.\nThe committee members will determine prices based on market sentiment and in the best interest of the DAO. All ETH proceeds from sales and any remaining nouns will be transferred to the treasury after one month, which equates to 30 daily auctions.\nHerein, I propose the following tiered pricing for nouns based on their numbers:\n\nids: 0-99 at 43~51 ETH\nids: 100-299 at 38~43 ETH\n\n## Requested nouns\nThe sale of the following nouns should contribute 595~685 ETH to the treasury.\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/B1VxBo_e6.png)\n\n## Policy and Rules\n**1.1** The 15 treasury nouns will be sent to the multi-sig wallet, which is managed by 5 trusted members.\n**1.2** The nouns held in the multi-sig safe are non-voting, meaning that the committee cannot use them for voting purposes.\n**1.3** Committee members will determine prices in the best interest of the DAO.\n**1.4** No treasury nouns shall be sold below the fork0-BV price.\n**1.5** The candidate proposal feedback section shall be used for suggestions.\n**1.6** The community is encouraged to propose committee members, and self-nomination is also encouraged.\n**1.7** All ETH proceeds from sales and any remaining nouns will be transferred to the treasury after one month, which equates to 30 daily auctions.\n\n\n## Multi-sig signers\nThis is a pro bono position, and committee members will receive a small amount of ETH to compensate for transaction fees only.\n\n1. __\n2. __\n3. __\n4. __\n5.

The launch of [SkateboardingCares.com](http://SkateboardingCares.com), a collective that's making \"concrete waves,\" is powered by [That's Gnarly](https://thatsgnar.ly) and further amplifies his dedication to merging skateboarding with technological advancements. \n\n[![](https://ipfs.decentralized-content.com/ipfs/bafybeidmc4oopw35og6e37gtv7fpppurjnfm3zcrjfurymgwf76rnyknl4)](https://twitter.com/bobburnquist/status/1604636743332159488) \n\nBob's advocacy for the NFT space is evident in his active participation at various events. His recent presence at **Blockchain Rio** and the upcoming engagement at **Rio Innovation Week** from October 3-6 showcases his dedication to promoting the onchain world. With **Skateboarding Cares DAO** being a pivotal component, he's ensuring that the skateboarding community is intricately linked with the latest in blockchain tech. \n\n![](https://ipfs.decentralized-content.com/ipfs/bafybeice6gg7is34tfvkx4iwbifdjcvg64fimxbjwgdfted44rpbikf274) \n\nFor those keen on tracking real-time updates on these endeavours, Bob's [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/bobburnquist/) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/bobburnquist) both serve as a window into his contributions and the broader impact of these initiatives. Or to get some further context on Bob's involvement with Nouns DAO, check out [Proposal 142](https://nouns.wtf/vote/142) that was sponsored by Gnars DAO. \n\n## 🔥 Bring on the \"Burnquest\" \n\nGifting [Noun 542](https://nouns.wtf/noun/542) to Bob Burnquist would be more than just a token of appreciation. It would be a celebration of a legend, an acknowledgment of his contributions, and a testament to the indomitable spirit of skateboarding. We'd be embarking on a quest of serendipity together, where the potential for collaboration is boundless. \n\n![](https://ipfs.decentralized-content.com/ipfs/bafkreicn34ghkmznkjyfn7zhbnyni73hwfmldaqhthpqivpi7frksopu2e) \n\nBob's committed to repping Noun 542 and participating in governance, as both a voter and nounish builder. His creativity and groundbreaking track record are testament to what he could, and already does, bring to Nouns. If there are times where his full focus is needed elsewhere, there's ample opportunity for thoughtful representation through delegation, either by his team, vast network with deep industry experience, or as part of educational endeavours at his institute. \n\n![](https://ipfs.decentralized-content.com/ipfs/bafybeideeb4fbkn2i3s37fmq5tnkzr3krmi5l4wyza7sx7a2tcchkwddge) \n\n▶️ *[Click here](https://www.voxels.com/play?coords=E@1007E,1112N) to visit to Bob's Voxels property (got a tour on our most recent call)* \n\nI've followed Bob's career since I was a child, and as an amateur skateboarder, I'm thrilled to have even met him, let alone be collaborating with him directly.

It's a wonderful feeling to come full circle and present an opportunity such as this one to the community I hold so dear.

Most of the funds were used to purchase 14 sails, print logos, and rent boats. J24 sailboats is most popular sailboat with including many yacht clubs in US. We still have sails and can use these sails to promote nouns and build relations with teams and yacht clubs. Yachting is different from skateboarding and esports. It is less viral but each club has 500+ members and sailing programs for various age groups. I hope someday we can establish connections with numerous yacht clubs and unite them for the sustainability cause for example distributing glasses made from recycled plastic.\n\nThe photos from prop102 and 173 are currently circulating on social media, and I have sent two of the sails from 102 to teams in Argentina and Greece.\n\nFor prop173, I exceeded the budget by $20,000 because I had to purchase racing sails in the US last minute due to artwork delays and cancelation from the drone photographer.\n\nActually, many were excited about the sailing event but couldn't visit New York. I reserved a large boat for 70 people and seven smaller boats for 30 people. Some individuals who registered couldn't attend for personal reasons for example artmatr and electric capital.

Also want to acknowledge the excellent feedback from Noun 40 and Trent re: shifting the framing of Protocol Guild from glamorous heroes to tireless stewards / maintainers in the co-created universe of Ethereum. We will work that feedback in with The Line and post an updated script via Propdate.\n\n## Why support Protocol Guild? \n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/S1yDWDxWa.jpg)\n\nNouns love public art and software, and Protocol Guild maintains the most important public software to us: Ethereum. We've demonstrated this in the past to the [tune of 500 ETH](https://www.nounsagora.com/proposals/108). Instead of continuing with direct donation, I'm proposing that we leverage our financial and creative resources to make a film about PG, and release it as a mintable NFT whose proceeds go towards the Guild.\n\nThis is not only great for PG, but also affords us a unique opportunity to use nounish imagery, characters and themes in a piece of media that will widely seen in our prime demographic of humans who love and care for ethereum.\n\nIt's true that \"donating\" via a mintable film is more risky than giving money directly – but I think telling the story of Ethereum and Protocol Guild through the lens of Nouns is something we can uniquely do. Other DAOs like UNI and LIDO may be able to donate more due to their larger treasury – but none have the mission and mandate to fund creative endeavours like we do.\n\nA successful $400k investment in storytelling can have a **broader reach** than our previous 500ETH investment and drive far **more direct positive attention** to Nouns while at the same time providing financial and cultural support to Protocol Guild. And we have evidence this can work, both from our [past](https://www.thisisnouns.wtf/) [successful](https://www.premiere.wtf/) droposals and the [Stand with crypto](https://zora.co/collect/eth:0x9d90669665607f08005cae4a7098143f554c59ef) mint.\n\n## What's the story we're going to tell?\n\n[![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BJuogvxb6.jpg)](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/npgcssj0xy1xyid9utxob/Nouns_Pitch.mov?rlkey=z8cgbr02oza3e6wl1h3scv54z&dl=0)\n\nPlease watch Bjorn, our director, tell you the story, settings, and characters in his voice. We're working with a draft story and visual references, and will be refining it all over time with input from the Nouns community. Our current draft story is something like this:\n\n>This is a story set in a floating port town, which metaphorically represents the Ethereum ecosystem. Everyone is gathered to celebrate the return of the Protocol Guild, a group of adventurers bringing back innovations that will improve the town (metaphorically EIP-4844). The Nouns play host to these adventurers by inviting them to a big feast. We follow a young child who looks up to the Protocol Guild and follows them across their journey around town, in hope of meeting his heroes.\n\nIf you'd like to check out [the draft script](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1T1Gw8W74_9BR_o6ADetRxnyxza-SPR7lZdof9jTPslg/edit?usp=sharing) yourself!\n\n\n## The world and its characters\nYou should definitely check out Bjorn's video explaining the world in his own words, but check these images for a preview! And feel free to [flip through the reference deck yourself!](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NI_MTJSPafHsAi-W37BWFQeDsi-uBFQe/view?usp=sharing)\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rJaijgagp.jpg)\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BJ6jogpl6.jpg)\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/ryTijlpe6.jpg)\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HkpjolTx6.jpg)\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/r16ssgpea.jpg)\n\n\n\n## Who's making the film?\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/r1OnCNL1a.jpg)\n\nWe're working with The Line – a BAFTA-nominated animation studio whose work span across work for major brands and original animation. They've worked extensively with top tier artists and brands like [Gorillaz](https://www.thelineanimation.com/work/gorillaz), [Lil Nas X](https://www.thelineanimation.com/work/lilnasx-star-walkin), and [Marvel Studios](https://www.thelineanimation.com/work/hero-marvel-snap), and [Nickelodeon](https://www.thelineanimation.com/work/nickelodeon-vines). Our director will be Bjorn-Erik Aschim, who's also a studio co-founder.\n\nI reached out to them not only because they worked on a [viral Chobani video about a solarpunk farm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-Ng5ZvrDm4) – which I think visually and emotively embodies the vision the aspiration of Nouns and Ethereum really well, but also because they are one of the best studios in the world, whose work is widely recognized in the creative industry.\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/H11spyae6.png)\n\n## Funding & milestones\n**Funding**\n\nI'm requesting $400k USDC to fund this short animation. 100% of the amount goes to The Line to fund the development of the film. The funds will be released over 2 milestones: 1/2 upfront, and 1/2 upon completion.\n\nMilestone payment will be held in an escrow multisig whose signers are the Agora team and will be disbursed to The Line upon milestone completion. In the unlikely event that the film cannot be completed, the remainder funds will be returned to the DAO.\n\nThen, trent.eth from Protocol Guild will submit another proposal to the DAO to release the short film as a droposal with 70% of the proceeds going to Protocol Guild, 20% to Nouns treasury, and 10% to Agora. \n\n\n## What's Agora / Yitong's role in this?\nI'm incredibly excited about more Nouns-produced short films released as Droposals, because there's a real flywheel here if we can demonstrate that Nouns can create super high quality short films that also have real mint value. \n\nIt's why we're working on an [easy Droposals](https://www.nounsagora.com/proposals/346) creator at Agora, and I can think of no better film than one about Ethereum itself to demonstrate the power of Droposals.\n\n\n## Timeline\nDates are approximate, and may change by a few days depending on exact timing of the candidate approval. During the process, Yitong will serve as liaison between The Line and the Nouns community to make sure we have the chance to provide feedback during each phase of production.\n\nw/c 19th Oct - Proposal approved (PAYMENT MILESTONE 1 50%)\nw/c 26th Oct - Creative Phase commences\nw/c 10th Nov - Creative Phase Deck Approval\nw/c 16 Nov - Pre-production commences\nw/c 30th Nov - Edit Lock & Designs approval\nw/c 21th Dec - Layout approve\nw/c 21th Dec - Production commences\nw/c 25 Dec - Christmas Break\nw/c 25th Jan - Animation approve\nw/c 25th Feb - Comp approved\nw/c 22 Feb - Final Delivery (PAYMENT MILESTONE 2 50%)\n\n\n## A story in chapters\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/ryKSTlTeT.png)\nIf we're successful with this first film, we can serialize this into a series of short animations celebrating major Ethereum milestones so that we can both create an ongoing source of funding for Protocol Guild, and tell an episodic story that builds into a larger narrative and universe that can stand on its own and be appealing to a mass audience who might not even know about Nouns or Ethereum.\n","proposer":"0xC3FdAdbAe46798CD8762185A09C5b672A7aA36Bb","startBlock":18351475,"endBlock":18380275,"executed":true},"votes":[{"support":0,"voter":"0x008c84421dA5527F462886cEc43D2717B686A7e4","numberOfVotes":9,"reason":"I love PG and support them full throatily, but  it's more efficacious if we make pure art for Nouns and give straight ETH to PG.

I mean, I don't necessarily blame that person. but I think it's just a reality that we make these public goods contributions that roughly nobody knows about, and while I still fight for those props b/c it's still important we do them to keep true to our own values, I think it's worth being honest that it hasn't done much in getting ppl to know more about nouns and a much better iteration would be something that could accomplish both like this prop has a chance to.\n\nyes $400k is a big bet, but what I would expect from The Line and yitong here would be something truly world-class, and that's exciting. the bar for success here is high but there's a chance they really pull it off. what success looks like imo is the entire ethereum community going nuts about this animation. ethereum hasn't really had much cultural pieces made about itself like this that imagines a future where ethereum is successful and ubiquitous. a film that vitalik (and other leading figures in eth world) would mint and retweet organically just because it's awesome would be the bar here. \n\ncould it raise money for PG? in the success case it definitely could. the wizard's hat mint was 0.05 ETH (I think this is a healthy price and we should price the mint for this something high like this; it's a donation and the right ppl will feel good about making a decent donation to PG exp celebrating art like this). for the wizard's hat mint it minted out around 2320 (a good chunk of that was speculative, but that's expected for any successful nft mint and that's fine, we can leverage that here as well). could we do much more than 2320? vitalik did this NFT mint with gitcoin to raise money for gitcoin (also at 0.05 ETH) and it sold 9209 copies (https://gitcoin.metalabel.app/quadraticfunding). it would be epic if we could beat that. a world where nouns is super successful is where we become a community that can routinely pull off things like that. super excited to have a shot at big success here. absolutely no one better than the line and the agora team to take a swing at this.

First, I agree that this should not be the standard. We do not want to have to pay ETH every time a Noun is distributed. Verbs are not a standard case.

We should not assume that contributors now or in the future are in a financial position to take on the tax burden themselves for receiving a Noun.

The tax burden exists no matter what possible claims, redemptions, vesting, or other smart contract methods exist.\n5.

Noun's Bidet Revolution!** \n# TLDR\nMakeWater is seeking $34,000 USDC to provide low-income families with Nouns-branded bidets, educate the community on their benefits, and produce high-quality video content showcasing the initiative.\n\n# Summary \n\nWith a $34,000 proposal, MakeWater aims to shift U.S. bathroom culture by promoting bidets, a net positive for the environment and households. Bidets can slash toilet paper costs, boost hygiene, and ease water infrastructure stress. Our pilot will provide Nouns-branded bidets to low-to-middle-income families, complete with DIY installation videos. \nThe initiative involves an educational drive where students, acting as citizen scientists, gather and share data on bidet usage and delve into water issues in their region. This hands-on approach also includes field trips to local water facilities, providing them with a comprehensive understanding of bidet advantages. By partnering with water utilities and local governments, we envision a self-sustaining model, continually championing bidet use. \nAs this initiative grabs headlines, Nouns will stand out as the pioneering force behind it. Your support will be the kickstart we need!\n\n**Update** We’ve updated the proposal after listening to feedback and reduced the initial ask, explained our goal for a self-sustained program (no future nouns funding required), and highlighted how Nouns will be seen as the hero catalyzing this revolutionary change in bathroom culture.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# How will it work?\n[![Screen Shot 2023-09-20 at 10.20.35 AM|690x388](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/lilnouns/original/1X/64fdc44ca71b4895023689cf724500b0b393e1b8.jpeg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zr56zofQX2o)\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zr56zofQX2o](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zr56zofQX2o)\n\nOur  journey will start with our pilot program in South Texas which will be a pivotal step for data collection, refining strategies, and pinpointing best practices. We are delighted to have already gained the enthusiastic support and active engagement of local utilities and educators,  who will propel the growth of our community and our vision.\nThrough our ongoing community-building efforts, we will strive to gather a strong initial group of participants in South Texas, our pilot region. Far from being just beneficiaries, these participants will become pioneers, actively contributing to data collection and shaping a communal narrative through social media engagement. These authentic stories, personal experiences and testimonials,  will initiate a cultural shift towards bidet use and create a united front against water wastage.\nThe Nouns DAO can kickstart this effort, providing the initial push needed to get the ball rolling. But this isn't just a one-time splash; it's a tide of transformation! The real heart of this initiative is its ability to keep going on its own. Our goal is more than just handing out affordable bidets; it's about making a lasting change in how people use bathrooms in America.\nThis initiative will be a wave of change that keeps building and reaching farther. Our pilot program marks the first splash, but together, we have the power to reshape perspectives, enhance water sustainability, and fundamentally revolutionize water habits across the United States.\n\n**Want a Limited Edition Golden Nouns Bidet ⌐◨-◨?** \nDonate 0.05 ETH or more at  [https://app.endaoment.org/orgs/81-1369592](https://app.endaoment.org/orgs/81-1369592).\nAll contributions further our mission, and as a token of our appreciation, you'll receive the exclusive bidet.\n\n\n# Why Bidets?\nEnter the humble toilet-mounted bidet — a nifty contraption that adds a touch of luxury to your bathroom routine. It replaces or fits beneath the toilet seat and uses a a nozzle to spray water for cleansing. Its installation is easy and doesn't demand a plumbing professional. Many models even showcase features like adjustable pressure, temperature control, and self-cleaning. Beyond all that, however, lies an ecological marvel— a cost-effective solution that promotes better hygiene while reducing toilet paper waste.\n\nBidets have garnered worldwide recognition for their remarkable water-saving abilities and paper-reducing magic. Embracing bidets translates to preserving trees, conserving water, and reducing the energy dedicated to manufacturing and transporting toilet paper.\n\nTheir appeal isn't just environmental; it's also rooted in hygiene. Bidets offer hands-free, pristine cleanliness, an invaluable health advantage, especially in a time when global health awareness is at its peak.\n\nOur aging water infrastructure poses yet another challenge. Sewage systems of many cities groan under the weight of non-degradable items. These infrastructures were designed for a different era, and non-degradable products like wet wipes weren't part of the plan. Despite their convenience, wipes don't break down in water like toilet paper does. This leads to stubborn blockages, damages to equipment, and ultimately, significant repair costs that households and communities have to bear.\n\nBidets, however, offer a sustainable lifeboat. By adopting bidets, we curtail clogs and damages, sparing households and cities from hefty repair costs. It's not just a bathroom upgrade; it's a blueprint for economic resilience, environmental harmony, and public health.\n\n\n\n\n\n## Our Background\n[![Screen Shot 2023-09-20 at 10.20.35 AM|690x388](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/lilnouns/original/1X/4d1175bec0882ed790ebee5f64ef9998d4ab6125.jpeg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0thwr7QItyE)\n[Video of our Lil Nouns Water Purification Kits built in partnership with the Light House for the Blind Nonprofit https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0thwr7QItyE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0thwr7QItyE)\n![79685689a8627fcb69f5c7a138529474869a119a_2_1034x748|690x499](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/lilnouns/optimized/1X/79685689a8627fcb69f5c7a138529474869a119a_2_1034x748.jpeg)\nLil Nouns Kits at our Black Girls Code Event in Houston. \n\n![|217x384](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/S_Kp1aNv2LHDB43Vd7I0bRW3nyPCIiP2lVjTWbgxXiDGTn70Y_I0Se93u0w_tHlnoWD1LzBKB4_w7iqBBz-8_Ogbj9kYiRXvt1rOCAVEyVv9r_UjpoFAu0OBOYZCEgScAS1bb44qldiFXtw4YtwVXWI)\n\n*View MakeWater Endaoment Donation History https://app.endaoment.org/orgs/81-1369592\n* In June 2022, Lil Nouns passed our 3,000 nouns kits for students proposal by a resounding 211 to 4 vote (➡️see [here](https://lilnouns.wtf/vote/16)).\n* We teamed up with Lighthouse for the Blind to create these kits, and we marked our partnership with a video (➡️watch it[ here](https://youtu.be/0thwr7QItyE)).\n* Our victory streak continued with a win at the FoodNouns Prop, where our proposal to create video vignette for our water education curriculum (click to watch our video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYrK_6Y_qUU), ➡️and check out our [tweet](https://twitter.com/makewaterorg/status/1659299148066177024?s=20)) garnered unanimous support (➡️see our %100 positive votes in [here](https://www.foodnouns.wtf/vote/3)).\n* We’ve also received a positive response Lil Nouns PropHouse (Open Round 12) for our proposal asking Lil Nouns to be a 3D printer prize sponsor for World Water Day youth competition (➡️see [here](https://prop.house/lil-nouns/round-12-open/3649)).\n* Nounish Team also highlighted our work on World Water Day, with a reel showcasing our work and our ongoing partnership with the community (➡️see [here](https://youtube.com/shorts/4rzK2iCFoWA?feature=share)).\n* Beyond our cherished Nouns community, our network encompasses educators, water utilities, and beyond.

With contracts built by Wilson, Propdates is the best way to keep up with Nouns proposals after they pass, and an entirely new design space within the greater Nouns ecosystem. We’ve never had any consistent, onchain way to keep track of contributors’ work, and no way to recommend regular updates. Down the line, one could imagine Propdates as an onchain oracle for proposal progress.\n\n## PROGRESS SO FAR\nI built the Propdates site and public graph, inspired by Krel’s [requests.wtf](http://requests.wtf). What started as a weekend experiment has grown into something much bigger: it’s clear that we’ve tapped into something special. In fact, Propdates has already become part of the pre-proposal conversation process - it is expected that a proposer regularly updates the DAO on their work. In just a few weeks, we already have had 17 unique posters, and more coming.\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/mt9nCgz/metrics.png)\n![](https://i.ibb.co/CzXyQrg/other.png)\n\n## LOOKING AHEAD\nWe’d like to move Propdates from an experiment to a fully-featured Nouns app and a key part of the ecosystem, on par with teams like Agora, Federation, Prop House. Our end goal is for Propdates to be a protocol any contract or app can plug into to determine a proposal’s success. It is clear that it could expand further than just Nouns.\n\nWe are asking for three months of funding (more on the team below). Martin will be close to full-time, but working on other projects as well (similar to almost all software proposers). We expect Onion to be part time for two months or so. For these months, our priorities will be:\n1.  Contract improvements to expand functionality  & data\n\t- New channels to post updates in: prop house entries, user channels, custom channels\n\t- Revamped admin system / permissions + “Super Admin” to unlock proposals where proposer is unresponsive\n\t- Explore contract to update/revoke streams based on a proposal's updates\n2.  Improved editor, claiming and submitting UX\n\t- Easy image upload via Arweave or IPFS (and potentially expand as a public good for Nouns ecosystem)\n\t- In-app markdown editor and previews for better UX\n3.  Farcaster integration for likes & comments on updates\n4.  Open Editions to celebrate Completed Props\n\nOur goals by January 31st, 2024 are:\n-   150 proposals marked as completed\n-   400 updates posted\n-   30 weekly updates on average\n\nAdditionally, we want to encourage past proposals to share updates on their work, but recognize it’s often hard for contributors to track down their sponsoring proposers (pre-v3). We are requesting 0.05 ETH to send to each of the first 100 successful props (before prop #363) that posts a non-trivial update as an incentive to kickstart the protocol. At the time of writing there have been 225 successful proposals, so this would go a long way to getting all proposals marked as completed.\n\n## TEAM\n\n-   [martin](https://twitter.com/anquetil) worked on [Mogu](http://nouns.wtf/vote/321), [Explorer Grants](http://nouns.wtf/vote/178), [Hack Week](http://nouns.wtf/vote/253)\n-   [onnnnnnnion](https://twitter.com/onnnnnnnion) (solidity) worked on [BLOCKS](https://mint.fun/zora/0x1F781d47cD59257D7AA1Bd7b2fbaB50D57AF8587), [onions renderer](https://twitter.com/onnnnnnnion/status/1639045062595170307), [PH Infinite Round Committee](https://prop.house/infinite/nouns-retro-grants)\n\n## FUNDING\n-   Team: 30 ETH for three months (via Stream)\n-   Incentives: 5 ETH (100 * 0.05 ETH)\n-   OpEx: 2 ETH\n \nWe commit to posting updates on [updates.wtf](https://updates.wtf) bi-weekly to keep the community updated on our progress.

We wanted our content to resonate with a clearly defined audience that was large enough to have a significant impact on Nouns.\n\nSo we developed a framework to test  hypotheses for different audiences and content, and in our recent [proposal update](https://www.updates.wtf/prop/289), we go into details on the different tests we ran.\n\n---\n\n## Finding PMF\nThree months into our testing, we created a hit with our new reality TV-style concept, \"3 Artists, 1 Noun.\" The show features a short and playful competition between three world-class artists to create a new piece of art inspired by the day’s noun within just five hours.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/b46zY6k.jpg)\n\nThe show quickly became popular on Instagram, with the top episode receiving over 1 million organic views. We have released eight episodes so far, which have received over 2 million views and brought us over 70,000 new followers.\n\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/KhoDu0v.gif)\n\n\nOther signs of PMF include a very high engagement rate: our top episode got 140,000 likes (a 14% like/view ratio), and every episode receives hundreds of comments, saves, and shares.\n\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/SpVe7hi.gif)\n\n\n---\n\n## Our Audience\nThe audience that the show is attracting is consistently identifiable as what we call \"The Creatives.\" Our followers are designers, artists, creative directors, filmmakers, animators, illustrators, and so on. We also have attracted some well known brands in the creative sector, including [Wacom](https://www.instagram.com/wacom) and [Artlist](https://www.instagram.com/artlist.io).\n\nWe see this as a chance to build a community outside the crypto bubble that is a perfect fit for Nouns, a group of talented and inspired creative people.\n\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/k2yxgRA.jpg)\n\n\n---\n\n## More Than Growth: A Relationship With Our Audience\n\nBy turning the camera back on ourselves we are making ourselves a tangible representation of the Nounish values they can relate to – joyous, welcoming, playful, creative, and collaborative.  \n\n\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/dPMAnxm.gif)\n\n\n\n\nAs we share our inspiring culture (one completely in line with Nouns' own values) our audience will grow to love the show and the people on it. And in the long term, as the connection between us and our audience deepens, we give ourselves the best chance to galvanise them to engage with Nouns in a more meaningful way.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/UONjU3I.jpg)\n\n---\n\n\n## Season 3: 10X again\n\nIn season 3, our goal is to 10X our audience again from 80K to 800K followers in 6 months.\n\n**How will we achieve this?**\n\n* Double down on 3 Artists and keep on iterating to reach tens of millions of people\n* Develop new content that will resonate with our community\n* Experiment with new formats (e.g. length of show) to breakout on YouTube\n\n---\n\n## Longer term\n\nOver the next few years, we will reach tens of millions of people and build a massive followership via content that engages, entertains, inspires, and educates about Nouns. We think nounish can help build the distribution Nouns needs to reach mass market. We are fired up and excited to build this and to bring Nouns mainstream!\n\n---\n\n## Our Ask\nWe are asking the same budget from the past two seasons: $969,000 USD\nFor the same amount of time: 6 months.\n\n## Transactions\n* 30% up front ($290K USDC)\n* 70% streaming over 6 months from December 17, 2023 to June 17, 2024 ($679K USDC)","proposer":"0x49a5aEec7d9AC70990404278e93031E4C3C71875","startBlock":18391619,"endBlock":18420419,"executed":true},"votes":[{"support":1,"voter":"0xA86882277E69FbF0a51805cdc8b0a3a113079E63","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":"For s2 renewal there was some (legitimate) debate wrt if the large spend was justified.

My concerns with this proposal are twofold. First, I think the ask of ~1M for 6mo of work may be fair compensation for the team, but unfortunately with a significantly lower treasury balance, i think this is pretty high. For an entire year, this would be ~2M USD (>10% of overall treasury) to be spending on marketing content. I am all for marketing content, but I think that large chunk of the treasury could probably be spent on more accretive proposals (subjective). Given lower treasury amt, I would be open to a lower prop amt, even if it slows output amt or pace. Second, I am not a fan of followers as a KPI. Followers/Impressions are always an extrinsic metric, and something we have no control over. We should always strive for intrinsic metrics and KPIs.

I'm curious how this content would perform on TikTok, where \"going viral\" happens more quickly and reaches far more users than on Instagram.\n\n2) To this team: What do you think about a north star metric of # of artists who have partnered with the nounish account?

Check out our playable demo here (use Safari for MacOS users):\n[NounsTown Demo](https://thepixelshop.itch.io/nounstown-demo)\n\n\n# PROLIFERATION\nOur proposal aims to proliferate Nouns by focusing on a ***specific target market of the PC gaming community*** that is interested in indie games, specifically ***the rogue-lite genre***.  A rogue-lite indie game provides a compelling opportunity for Nouns to enter the gaming sector due to the following reasons:\n\n##### Rising Popularity\n- Indie developers have had incredible success in recent years due to their ability to design ***innovating*** and ***creative*** new games that AAA studios often avoid\n- Developers have gained access to multiple ***mass distribution platforms*** such as Steam, Nintendo Switch, Itch.io, and Epic Games to reach a wide audience\n- Available resources and advancements in game development have provided a landscape for small teams, or even individual developers, to produce games with a ***powerful cultural impact and longevity***\n\n##### Lower Risk Entry to Gaming\n- We conceptualized the game design to ensure as much value and ***replay-ability*** while maintaining a ***reasonable scope*** of work and ***longer-term scalability***\n- Our proposal provides for a ***phased funding and development approach*** to ensure a ***transparent production*** process, opportunities to receive ***community feedback***, and provide multiple ***tiers of content***\n- We will use ***Steam as our distribution platform*** to launch the game; however, we will explore porting the game to Nintendo Switch after the initial launch and financial considerations\n\n##### The Charm of Pixel Art\n- Our art team collectively has over ***30 years of pixel art experience*** and will design a game aesthetic that will resonate with indie gamers and pixel art enthusiasts\n- Pixel art games have had tremendous success with nearly ***13,000 games available on Steam.***  Some household names including Stardew Valley, Shovel Knight, Celeste, Terraria, Hyper Light Drifter, Enter the Gungeon, Octopath Traveler, and Baba is You\n- Our game will showcase many different pixel art styles including our ***modern aesthetic gameplay, retro style UI and game map, and high resolution portraits***\n\n##### Creative Commons\n- All of the ***art and animations*** that we produce during development will be ***open-source*** and available to the community to use!\n- ***After development***, we will ***consider making the game open-source*** to collaborate with game developers and artists to contribute new content\n\n# GAME OVERVIEW\n##### Game Engine\nThe game will be developed using ***Godot 4***, a free and open-source game development engine!  \n\n##### Genre\n**Rogue-Lite**\nThe key feature of a Rogue-Lite genre is a game loop that results in ***permadeath***.  Each time a player begins their attempt or run, they will either defeat the final boss or die trying.  A Rogue-Lite game generally involves some ***permanent progression*** that takes place ***outside of the run***; usually in the form of upgraded weapons, statistics, abilities, or skill trees.\n\n**Bullet Hell**\nBullet Hell combat mechanics emphasize ***complex bullet patterns*** for the player to navigate and dodge.  Our bullet hell game will be designed as a twin stick shooter where the player is on a ***flat plane with a top-down perspective***.  They will then use one joystick to control the player and the other joystick to control the direction of shooting, or for the real ones, mouse for shooting and keyboard for movement!\n\n**Non-Linear Progression**\nOne of the unique selling points of our Rogue-Lite game is that it will have Non-Linear progression.  The two main features to highlight in this design include a ***unique map that is generated each run*** and the freedom for the player to ***decide their order of progression***.    Each location will have distinct characteristics that the Player may take advantage of depending on their weapon selection and upgrade composition.  \n\n**Inspiration**\n[Enter the Gungeon](https://store.steampowered.com/app/311690/Enter_the_Gungeon/), [Hades](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1145360/Hades/), [Risk of Rain 2](https://store.steampowered.com/app/632360/Risk_of_Rain_2/), [Nuclear Throne](https://store.steampowered.com/app/242680/Nuclear_Throne/), [Vampire Survivors](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1794680/Vampire_Survivors/)\n\n\n##### Story\nWelcome to the world of ***Nouns Town***, a charming community nestled amidst pixelesque landscapes.

New weapons are unlocked through an achievements system and provide diverse play styles and synergies, for example:\n\n- Sniper Rifles - Slow fire rate and reload rate, but high single target damage\n- Shotguns - high close range damage, but wide bullet spread at long range\n- Rocket and Grenade Launchers - significant area of effect damage, but slow reload speed and fire rate\n- Assault rifles - higher ammo capacity and fire rate, but less damage per bullet\n\n**Sample** **Weapons:**\n![Weapon Concepts](https://www.notion.so/image/https%3A%2F%2Fprod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F5fdb596a-f044-4277-a067-1d0c0adeb263%2F457fa7a0-a1a4-4ec4-ad5d-b0887aa853cb%2Fweapons.png?table=block&id=f4229042-9adf-4a99-9c0c-83b4fcdde425&spaceId=5fdb596a-f044-4277-a067-1d0c0adeb263&width=2000&userId=b2ba77e2-e1fb-4bba-a5e3-92cbd6539673&cache=v2)\n\n##### Upgrades\nAs the player clears each room,  they are rewarded a pair of Noggles to return to their rightful owner and gain a new weapon modifier.  Each upgrade is inspired by various characters from the Nouns collection.  Early concepts include:\n\n- Lightning Bolt Noun unlocks chain lightning\n- Basketball Noun unlocks bouncing bullets\n- Popsicle Noun unlocks frost bullets\n- Pencil Noun unlocks piercing bullets\n- Chipboard Noun unlocks spark aura\n- Baseball Noun unlocks curving bullets\n\nPlayer upgrades each have multiple tiers of strength.  Further, different combinations of upgrades will create fun synergies and provide a unique gameplay experience each run.  Unique and innovative upgrades will be explored during game development.\n\n![Upgrade Card Previews](https://www.notion.so/image/https%3A%2F%2Fprod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F5fdb596a-f044-4277-a067-1d0c0adeb263%2Feef9abba-1288-4e3d-9be3-02216f525651%2Fnouns_upgrades_promo.png?table=block&id=d9a79c15-bee4-42f8-ae7e-5b1a53e0d826&spaceId=5fdb596a-f044-4277-a067-1d0c0adeb263&width=2000&userId=b2ba77e2-e1fb-4bba-a5e3-92cbd6539673&cache=v2)\n\n##### Minions and Bosses\n\nMinions and Bosses will be based on the Forgotten Runes Wizard’s Cult: Forgotten Souls collection.  All minions will be designed to have a diverse range of attack styles and bullet patterns.  Early attack style concepts include melee, burst range, sniper range, summoners, and complex bullet patterns for elite minions.  \n\nWe will use rare NFTs from the Forgotten Souls collection as our Stage Bosses and the Lich King as our final boss.  Our first Boss engagement will be designed and implemented in Phase I of production.\n\n**Sample** **Minion Designs:**\n![Minion Concepts](https://www.notion.so/image/https%3A%2F%2Fprod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F5fdb596a-f044-4277-a067-1d0c0adeb263%2Fed2d7a9a-3f76-484b-9c3b-a8bef7f00f4a%2Fminions.png?table=block&id=c90faec9-9a19-40dc-9b9a-aeab46b202ab&spaceId=5fdb596a-f044-4277-a067-1d0c0adeb263&width=2000&userId=b2ba77e2-e1fb-4bba-a5e3-92cbd6539673&cache=v2)\n\n##### Map and Room Design\n\nWith the game’s setting taking place in Nouns Town, our protagonist will progress through the map to clear each location of the Forgotten Souls.  As mentioned in the Genre section above, our map and game loop will have a ***Non-Linear*** design.  The design will have the following characteristics:\n\n**Unique Generative Maps**\n\n- Each run will generate a new Nouns Town map seed with approximately 30 - 45 Locations, 2 Stage Boss chambers, and 1 Final Boss chamber\n- The Player will have the freedom to decide which locations to clear first\n\n**NPC and Event Rooms**\n\n- We will include friendly NPCs and locations to provide healing, potential upgrades, and/or narrative progression\n- Additionally, we are exploring various Event Rooms that occur random times throughout each run that provide new challenges for the player\n\n**Room Architecture**\n\n- We will design a large library of Locations and Rooms that the map generator will pull from to maintain a unique and diverse world for each play through\n- Room types within each location will have consistent thematic designs to provide new challenges and allow the player to associate location aesthetics to gameplay characteristics\n\n**Room Decorations**\n\n- We will produce a library of tile sets, decorations, barriers, and destructible objects to fill each room with a fun and unique personality inspired by Nouns\n- We will mix and match each room’s architecture to various aesthetics to give each room a unique personality and provide diversity between each run\n\n**Sample assets:**\n![Tile Set Preview](https://www.notion.so/image/https%3A%2F%2Fprod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F5fdb596a-f044-4277-a067-1d0c0adeb263%2F440c398d-3d22-4e10-93c7-1ed447b2e1ca%2Ftileset_sample.png?table=block&id=7419a6e2-cfd2-4208-9a47-5d3715964af5&spaceId=5fdb596a-f044-4277-a067-1d0c0adeb263&width=2000&userId=b2ba77e2-e1fb-4bba-a5e3-92cbd6539673&cache=v2)\n\n##### Sound Design\n\nFull sound design will include sound effects and an original soundtrack.  We aim to capture a combination of playful comic-like sound effects paired with a sound track inspired by hip-hop and funk instrumentals.  We are in discussion with a number of experienced sound designers that are interested in joining the team later in development.\n\n# PRODUCTION STATUS\n\n##### Pre-Production Complete - Phase 0: Design, Prototype, and Art Style\n\nOur team began production in July 2023 and have established the game design document, art and animation style, game framework and systems, and our initial prototype.

I agree that, at some point, there should be nouns-inspired games. However, I am not convinced that the gameplay presented here, and the team, are the right choices.\n\nHere are detailed reasons why I vote against:\n\n1) The gameplay is simple and lacks uniqueness. Run and gun games are over-saturated market and have limited story depth.\n2) It appears that The Pixel Shop already has several ongoing projects, which, in my opinion, would prevent you from dedicating full time to the nouns-inspired game.\n3) I believe the DAO will be able to fund only one or two $600k games. Before committing to such funding, it would be wiser to commission 10 indie games with budgets of $10-20K each to explore different gameplays and development teams. It would be best to start an initiative that resembles the Nouns Stories (prop180), where the DAO commissions a series of cost-effective experiments and then would select one idea, that fits best the nouns, for future funding."},{"support":1,"voter":"0x16C88a1f5580d5a6dAE0F7701E0b7C1341B8BFA6","numberOfVotes":6,"reason":"SharkDAO votes For."},{"support":0,"voter":"0xDCb4117e3A00632efCaC3C169E0B23959f555E5e","numberOfVotes":16,"reason":"https://www.lilnouns.wtf/vote/nounsdao/414/votes\n\n**FOR 42 VOTE**\n\n**AGAINST 451 VOTES**\n\n**ABSTAINS 60 VOTES**"},{"support":0,"voter":"0xA86882277E69FbF0a51805cdc8b0a3a113079E63","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":"Since i signaled For ive had the chance give this prop more thought and also talk in person with Sumiez.\n\nAfter speaking with Sumiez im even more excited for him and his studio to take on Nouns and build an amazing indie game on top of the already rich nouns world and lore.\n\nBut i had to stop myself from projecting what i want this game to be, vs whats actually written in the proposal, and decided to vote Against in hopes of Sumiez coming back with an improved version.\n\nNow to some (hopefully) actionable feedback:\n- This proposal spends a lot of time pitching the genre (and its merits) rather than actually going deep on why _this_ game will be amazing. I wish it instead spent more time selling me on the game mechanics and going deep on how those mechanics can mesh with the current nouns lore and culture. The current prop does go into some detail wrt mechanics but its reads too much like a checklist ('there will be NPCs') and doesnt provide enough justification or paint a compelling picture as to why this makes the game better, or how it all fits together as a singular, focused gaming experience.\n- The art direction is a mixed bag. The pixel art definitely looks good, but the enemies, guns, etc looks out of place and its clear its not made for nouns. Even if those are placeholder assets(?) i believe the prop would gain from thinking more deeply about what weapons and enemies/antagonists (why a lich king?) makes sense in the context of nouns and explain that in words instead of pictures. (Merging the world with Forgotten Runes does not make much sense to me.)\n- I only want to vote for this prop if it has a *chance* of being another indie cult classic like some of the games references as inspiration. Speaking with Sumiez i get the sense thats what he wants to do *too*, but i dont think the prop does a good enough job communicating that ambition.\n- I would like Sumiez to spend more time in Nouns to better and more deeply understand nouns before drawing up the general game mechanics. I think this might be key to create something that is amazing vs simply competent delivery. (Supriyo comes to mind as a media creator who does this very well.)\n- Game dev is hard and takes an awful lot of time. Understanding how tough it is to present a 'vertical slice' to the dao, i urge the team to instead get the cultural touch points of nouns, coupled with a small handful of example assets and key mechanics, _just right_ as that will instill a lot of confidence and help provide you the initial funding/runway to go deeper/bigger."},{"support":0,"voter":"0xCEEd9585854F12F81A0103861b83b995A64AD915","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":"I think games and gaming can be a great avenue to proliferation but I have concerns with the overall budget when looking at the future funding requests in this prop.

Consider how Hollow Knight has charms that offer different power ups — could different Noggles offer unique powers when equipped? And could your quest be to collect all the Noggles? Other potential ideas: strawberries in Celeste, frogs in Mother 3, question blocks in Mario...\n\n3) In terms of aesthetic and vibes, I'm gently encouraging the team to explore a more vibrant, optimistic palette. Nouns is a whimsical brand with strong, happy colors; thus the screenshots in this prop look off-world to me. But this is not super strong feedback FYI :) \n\n4) The demo doesn't load for me on itch.\n\nFeedback on game format:\n\n1) The helpful constraint that beat-em-ups offer is that you can focus on basic fighting and movement mechanics, and focus more on great art and level design. It's helpful that you don't need a good story, so I can understand why this format is a good constraint.\n\n2) However, Nouns is so WEIRD and whimsical that I am craving something super weird when it comes to games. I wonder if there's a way to make a fun game without blowing up scope — focusing on 1-3 super awesome-to-play mechanics like Towerfall / Celeste / Hollow Knight / Hyper Light Drifter / Kirby — or super fun in-game laws like Baba Is You or Katamari Damacy.\n\n3) If the team does consider changing formats, I encourage them to return with a proposal to fund a super scoped proof of concept on the game mechanic in action."},{"support":0,"voter":"0xE7304bA0f157f2Ade94015934284b6704BC72911","numberOfVotes":2,"reason":"Games are cool, but their meme-value is debatable even for games made by big-budget studios with cereal-box brand characters.\n\nThis game looks really cool, don't get me wrong.

Held at the Melbourne Convention Exhibition Centre, this event has touched the lives of over 165,000 children since its inception in 1986. The massive event is completely FREE for 5,000 children and 3,000 carers to attend, ensuring that each child receives a gift and experiences an inclusive day of fun, activities, stage entertainment, carnival rides, all-abilities sport and an all-important visit from Santa. For many, this celebration is the only one they have during the Christmas season, and the gifts they receive at the party are often the only ones they receive. The Variety Kids Xmas Party is a safe space for children living with disabilities or experiencing disadvantage or illness, allowing them to be themselves without fear of judgment from their peers. This remarkable event is made possible by the dedication and hard work of the small Variety team and over 600 volunteers.\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SkJSDa1xp.jpg)\n\n\n### ⌐◧-◧ Profound Impact:\nThe Variety Kids Xmas Party is more than just a day of fun; it&#39;s a lifeline for families who often feel isolated or overlooked.

Parents often remark on the transformative effect of the party, noting the boost in their children's confidence and self-esteem. The ripple effect extends beyond the children to their families, providing them with a much-needed respite and the chance to see their children thrive in a supportive environment. The memories created during the party serve as a source of strength and inspiration for families throughout the year.\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BkJ5cjkxT.jpg)\n\n### ⌐◧-◧ Testimonials:\n\"You have no idea what this means to us.

Variety will be contributing the balance of event costs as outlined in our budget section funded by donors who contribute to our Christmas appeal and throughout the year.\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/ryuBcikxp.jpg)\n\n\n**BUDGET**\n\n* Entertainment – all on-stage performers, Santa, dancers, character performers such as the Grinch and Real Dinosaurs, carnival rides including a ferris wheel, sideshow alley, Santa’s grotto, all-abilities sports activations, silent movie cinema, and main stage visual, LED screens, audio, staging, stage lighting & rigging $32,511 USDC\n* Photography/filming and package creation $3,219 USDC\n* Nouns Noggles - donated $0 USDC\n* LEGO - donated $0 USDC\n* Colouring sheets - printing $645 USDC\n* Free standing foam Noggles sculpture $645 USDC\n* Nouns signage x 25 $804 USDC\n* Nouns character costume $4,506 USDC\n* 600 Nouns branded tees worn by corporate volunteers across the venue $3,862 USDC\n* 2,000 temporary Noggles tattoos $1,287 USDC\n* TOTAL $47,479 USDC\n\nIn addition, Variety will be paying USD $128k (funded across the year by our donors) as follows\n* Catering extras (90% catering sponsor)\t$7,443\n* Event management and non-main stage venue AV, staging & rigging\t$31,900\n* Venue hire cost\t$15,400\n* Gift bag of toys for every child\t$64,169\n* Transport, freight, couriers and postage \t$2,951\n* Staffing, logistics, and marketing\t$6,416\n\t\n    \n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/B1L_0i1x6.jpg)\n\n\n### ⌐◧-◧ The Team\n**Georgie Smith - Variety Project Lead**\n[Georgie](https://https://twitter.com/RoxbySmith) has a twenty-five-year career in not-for-profit fundraising, marketing and event management and currently leads Variety – the Children’s Charity digital innovation program including crypto philanthropy.

These three artists in particular were very early builders in the nouns ecosystem, all were members of the first group of Nouncillors, and all have openly helped others in the ecosystem to help proliferate Nouns.\n\n**Prop Inspiration:** Important note - this idea came from me not Mr. Boney, Messhup or Sidenoun. As I was reflecting on my own nounish journey, these three kept popping up in my story, sometimes in obvious ways, other times just in the background, but always there. There are so many others who have also made strong contributions and should be recognized as well but this seemed like a great place to start.\n\nI reached out to all three and confirmed they would accept a Noun if given the opportunity and all agreed to hold it for a minimum of one year since we do not yet have a vesting contract in place. (Actually each one said they'd never sell when asked.)\n\nAs long time contributors to the ecosystem, I can think of no better future Nouners.\n\n### Mr. Boney\n\nLaunching just a couple months after Nouns on October 10, 2021, **[The Boneys](https://opensea.io/collection/theboneys)** combined Nouns and Cryptoadz to create a new spooky take on cc0 art. The collection has some well known holders, among them [**David Horvath**](https://x.com/davidzhorvath/status/1448014564159799307?s=20) (a Boney whale) and Luca Netz. \n\nIn addition to The Boneys, Mr. Boney also created [**The Boney Bats**](https://opensea.io/collection/the-boney-batz), [**UniToadz**](https://opensea.io/collection/unitoadz), [**$PepeToadz**](https://opensea.io/collection/pepetoadz) and has contributed advice and assistance on numerous other projects including the [**Yellow Collective**](https://x.com/theboneys/status/1711251203093626976?s=20).\n\n \nThe Boneys continues to captivate and provide a unique character in the Nouniverse, recognized all on its own as well as part of the Nouns ecosystem, even finding its way to the NFT mural in NYC, the first piece of nounish art to do so.\n \n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HyjYkq4Gp.png)\n\n\n\n---\n\n### Messhup\n\nAt the core of almost every iconic piece of nounish art is Messhup, including pieces such as the **[Meta Noun Square](https://opensea.io/collection/the-meta-square-a-special-open-edition-by-messhup)**, the [**Rose Parade open edition**,](https://opensea.io/assets/ethereum/0x628d8222f064e3a29a69814bd13974b0160e8538) and **[the Nouniversary](https://opensea.io/collection/nounniversary-01)**, and the incredible nounish sails for NFT.NYC. Whenever a banger art piece is needed, Messhup is tapped and always over-delivers.\n\nBeyond these amazing individual pieces of nounish art, [**Messhup**](https://opensea.io/Messhup/created) has launched multiple cc0 collections of his own including PeeperToadz, [**Meme Seizer**](https://opensea.io/collection/meme-seizer), and [**Serial Collectors**](https://opensea.io/collection/serialcollectors).\n  \nAlso an original member of Nouncil, Messhup created the **[Nouncil logo](https://nouncil.wtf/)** and supports nounish builders with his art, even recently dropping a piece out of the blue to honor the **[Boneversary](https://x.com/messhup/status/1712625204684333166?s=20)**.\n\n ![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/B1cZNqNfp.png)\n\n \n\n---\n\n### Sidenoun\n\nOne of the first recipients of a small grant from Nouns, Sidenoun launched the **[SideNoun](https://opensea.io/collection/sdn)** NFT project at the end of 2021 – an art project of cute nouns with their shifty eyes and the tagline: isometric nouns, looking highly suspicious. **[I personally came in through the SideNoun door](https://https://paragraph.xyz/@nounishprof/sidenoun)**, where I first encountered David Horvath in the discord and he set me straight on nouns traits. Not without its bumps and learnings, the Sidenoun project continues to shine as a small grants success story. \n\nBeyond this project, Sidenoun was also part of the original Nouncil core team – **[Nouncillor #1](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gxXEoxUhHbcRZVSIB3mVbmRp3lfv-clnevIMuqiY2Jo/edit#gid=0)**! -- and went on to develop **[BYN: Build Your Noun](https://byn.wtf/)**. In the early days, you could find him lending a helping hand in the Nouns discord. He also has been a contributor/advisor to many other nounish projects, including providing guidance, assistance and technical development for FloriNouns and Vessel Verse among others.\n\nSidenoun was also one of the projects highlighted by Bud Light leading up to the Nouns appearance in their Super Bowl commercial.\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/H1-2H5VfT.png)\n\n\n\n---\n\nAlthough there are many such deserving nounsfolk, I believe these three  -- **[Mr. Boney](https://twitter.com/theboneys)**, **[Messhup](https://twitter.com/messhup)**, and **[Sidenoun](https://twitter.com/sidenoun)** -- capture the essence of cc0 proliferation and have helped attract many to the Nouns ecosystem through their original artistic efforts.\n\n\n---\n\n \n**Summary of transactions:**\n\nNoun 326 to MrBoney.eth: 0x22D8D269A083EAD12E8D7F8fb9AdD8A38B5F4134 \n\nNoun 81 to Messhup.eth: 0x0C66d954d9cb1ebDF4E37a000262323C83655e70 \n\nNoun 826 to Sidenoun.eth  0xdB7f66F3D53A6A0EC43a49C7B6713e1bd3bd1383","proposer":"0xCEEd9585854F12F81A0103861b83b995A64AD915","startBlock":18438584,"endBlock":18467384,"executed":false},"votes":[{"support":1,"voter":"0xae4705dC0816ee6d8a13F1C72780Ec5021915Fed","numberOfVotes":0,"reason":"if not these guys then who?"},{"support":1,"voter":"0xCEEd9585854F12F81A0103861b83b995A64AD915","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":"Would love to see these three amazing nounish builders join as Nouners.

The rounds' focus would be to bring in exceptional people who have previously contributed something meaningful in their respective fields. **Taking inspiration from [Brian Armstrong](https://twitter.com/brian_armstrong/status/1681439056323051529), the round would serve as an explicit invitation for accomplished and interesting individuals to help steward Nouns.** \n\n\n**Round parameters:**\n- A two-week period for submitting proposals.\n- A one-week period for voting.\n- Open submission for all (with basic criteria to avoid spam).\n- Voting conducted by Nouns voters.\n- The proposer with the highest votes receives one Noun.\n\n**Logistics:**\nThe nouns would be escrowed in a [2/3 safe](0xDBDD666BFa569F72866Fba319271aC008B6bbe7a) managed by trusted community members [ccarella](https://twitter.com/ccarella), [necfas](https://twitter.com/necfas) and [seneca](https://twitter.com/cryptoseneca). \n\n**Timeline:**\nIf we stick to a ~20 day timeline, we can run three rounds between November and December with the final round ending on new years day :)\n\n**The Chosen Ones:**\nArmy Pickel, Icy Snowman, Fiery Cloud\n\n![image](https://i.imgur.com/CjYhViX.png)\n\n---\n\nIf the experiment is successful in attracting worthy participants, we could consider running continuous rounds to help allocate the 500+ Nouns in the treasury.

Distribution will be digital and physical, with plans for translation in 4 Languages. The project development will be shared through videos, live streams, and Open Editions, aiming for completion in 10-12 months.\n\n---\n\n## **A Graphic Novel (Vol 1)**.\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BkNjEYyzT.png)\n*Draft Cover/Poster*\n\nI’m targeting Graphic Novel readers (15+) who love both sci-fi and fantasy + adventure, usually read action-packed stories, but also love tech, and (included but not limited) are crypto users. The artwork will include concepts related to decentralization, blockchain, and internet technologies, and Nouns will be the characters that inhabit this universe.\n\nI firmly believe that we can find the right audience in Web3 at first, it’s an amazing niche to build a tech-oriented story and ultimately an onchain mythology, in which Nouns could be not only at the core of it but represent great values and a positive-sum culture.\n\nTo me, nouns are not only pixel characters, but something more, they are storytelling vehicles full of potential. And at the same time, there are dozens of small elements in our community lore to include in the story. \n\n---\n\n## **Evolution of the Nouns aesthetics (from my POV):**\nWe all love the original Nouns, they are perfect as the source material, but they are also really adaptable to using them in different styles.\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HyPczHAWa.png)\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BJ-R9gHga.png)\n*The last two images are from April-June 2022.*\n\n In this world-building adventure, I've given the term \"Noun\" a fresh perspective, digging into its meaning both on the surface and at a deeper, symbolic level. This project isn't just about testing how Nouns look; it's also about spinning an engaging tale. We want to hook current Noun fans and introduce new readers to our world, even if they're not blockchain or DAO experts.\n \n---\n\n## **Distribution:**\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rJE-Pclfa.png)\nDraft Cover.\n\n**Digital First:**\nThe main distribution strategy will be online (Free download from the website, manga/comic reader apps like Comixology, Viz Media, Kindle, and P2P/torrents).\nMost of the dedicated comic reader apps have more than 500K users minimum, but in the case of bigger apps like Comixology or Viz Media, they have millions of users combined in both the App Store and Google Store.\n\n**Physical:**\nPhysical copies will be handled through Amazon (highly efficient, global coverage, and no upfront costs). Plus, in case we can make a deal with regional publishers, it's easy to shut down the distribution of a translated version directly on Amazon.\n\n\n**4 Languages:**\nEnglish, Spanish, Japanese, and French. \n\nI cannot emphasize enough the significance of translating the graphic novel. Translating the artwork can create opportunities for publication by one or multiple publishers in Europe, Asia, or North America. Since many major publishers prefer to review a complete work, and this being the first volume, it could serve as an ideal means to engage regional publishers worldwide.\n\n\n---\n\n## **Concept Art:**\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rJoFWSRZT.png)\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SJYtXrR-a.png)\n\n---\n## **Summary of the story (subject to changes):**\n\n\nMeet Shady, a Noun who doesn't quite fit the mold of an obedient or exemplary citizen in a world teeming with adventurers, mysteries, and high achievers. His existence is a quiet rebellion in a society that prizes conformity. However, it seems destiny, if it exists, has grander designs for Shady. His insatiable curiosity catapults him into the uncharted territories of unexplored worlds.\n\nAs Shady embarks on this enigmatic journey, it becomes clear that more than just his life is at stake. The fate of his entire kind rests on his shoulders, and time is of the essence. He's faced with a dilemma: will he seize this opportunity to change the course of history or let it slip through his fingers?\n\n\n\n## **Sample Pages**\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/ryDRkBRWp.png)\n\n\n## **Characters from the first volume:**\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/Bk-7xu1zp.png)\n\n**Featuring the NounBots:**\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rJVbJ9xza.png)\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/S1nzkqeMa.png)\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SkRmycgM6.png)\n\n---\n\n## **Building in Public + Key Milestones:**\n\nI’m also building a graphic style to present the development of the project to the public in a more entertaining way using videos and/or live streams. This way people can follow more closely the development of the graphic novel and can ask questions about nouns and their ecosystem.\n\nThe goal is to make 2 videos per week (1 to 2 hours each) showing the process of the Graphic Novel, the idea is to use Twitch or YouTube (ideally both).\nI can also use propdates.wtf to show the latest news of the prop and the Manga channel in Farcaster.\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SyO0trwWa.png)\n*This is a sample of how the videos could look like*.\n\n## Key Milestones:\n\n**Concept and Team (Months 1-3):**\nDevelop the storyline and artistic style.\nAssemble and prepare the creative team.\n\n**Production and Marketing (Months 4-10):**\nCreate the 64-page graphic novel while translating it into multiple languages.\nImplement marketing and promotion strategies on online platforms.\n\n**Distribution and Launch (Month 11-12):**\nPlan and execute the distribution strategy for both digital and physical copies.\nOfficially launch the graphic novel, including online and potentially in-person events.\n\n**Audience Engagement and Public Building (Ongoing):**\nContinuously engage with the community on various platforms.\nAdapt the project based on audience feedback and reception.\n\n**Global Expansion and Future Planning (Ongoing):**\nStart the conversations with external publishers to get the graphic novel.\nEvaluate the project's performance and plan for the next chapters.\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/ByWvFmvG6.png)\n\n---\n\n## **Scope and Budget**:\nSince this is a graphic novel of 64 pages I will need around 10 to 12 months to finish it.\nThe ideal deadline would be the next Nouniversary and I’ll push myself and the team involved to do so, but I’m organizing the dates including all the team efforts and the standard timeframes to make the deadline more realistic so it could be released in October/November next year.\n\n---\n\n## **Budget Breakdown:**\n\n- **Preproduction -

Together, creatives on Atrium bring the best ranging experiences from **Pixar, Marvel, Luma Pictures, Sony, Netflix & many more.**\n\n---\n### Proposal Ask:\n 1,125,000 (375K X 3) USD for a time-period of 240 days.\n\n> Note: *Ask is following the funding breakdown shared in the original kick-off [proposal 245](https://nouns.wtf/vote/245).*  \n\n#### Proposal timeline progress\n![](https://i.postimg.cc/wBLDJgz6/3244.png)\n\n#### Why Ask for 3 episodes at once?\n- Working on 3 month-long milestones at a time was tuned in to showcase proof-of-work to DAO and drive accountability forward.\n\n\n- Since then [Nouns Movie](https://twitter.com/nounsmovie) team has led by example, on what it means to be transparent in production process and keeping community at large in the loo.\n\n\n- What we realised however, this introduced inefficiency in securing long-term senior talent to be available to work on the film as they have no guarantee on whether they will still be working on the film after 3 months (*for e.g. followup proposals not passing*). We are often competing against traditional studio contracts for senior talent.\n  \n- Funding 3 episodes upfront will enable us to introduce batching of tasks for pre-production and animation, making the process much more predictable to manage. \n\n\n- More funding committed for the film will enable us to pre-empt discussions with distribution partners who will have a clearer picture of financing on the project and high likelihood of it being fully completed once they commit.\n\n---\n#### Where will the funds go to?\n- **Story and Scripting** for the Episode 3, 4 & 5 \n- **Preview Work in Progress and BTS** delivered through out the proposal duration\n- **Finished Episode 3,4 & 5** - delivered by 240 days time period.\n- Propdates published all along the way.\n\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/r19IfQTw3.png)\n\n\nAs we continue production, the timeline becomes more efficient and shrinks, ultimately leading us to the film conclusion. \n\n#### Kickoff Notes for EP3 onwards\n- After Episode 2 release, the team will be on a short hiatus for the rest of November (2 weeks).\n- Team ramps back up slowly throughout month of December and sporadic availability due to holiday month.\n- Expected to fully iron out EP3 script during this time period.\n- Team back at full capacity starting January and full production loop resumes. \n---\n\n### Recap and Progress Updates so far\nYou can follow Ep2 Propdates [here](https://www.updates.wtf/prop/317). \n\n![](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/nouns/optimized/2X/2/2415348f7943c8a429024b648b3eb68b24a0d7fa_2_1380x862.jpeg)\n\n**Tl;dr:** Its bolder, bigger and better! \n\n\n#### Cast Announcements so far\n![](https://i.postimg.cc/1zVh9NsW/19.png)\n\n- [Elijah Fox](https://twitter.com/nounsmovie/status/1701347725407838288) (Voice of Gi)\n- [Lisa Stanley](https://twitter.com/nounsmovie/status/1656100844763496448) (Voice of Mrs Waxman)\n- [Ray Hurd](https://twitter.com/nounsmovie/status/1710009700341928121) (Voice of Go)\n- [Cesar Romero](https://twitter.com/nounsmovie/status/1711863323967578591) (Voice of Leader blunt)\n\n![](https://i.postimg.cc/253cSV1K/environment-factory-hallyway.png)\n#### Behind the Scenes\n- [Discourse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8E_7XtzU47c&ab_channel=AtriumAnimation) with the directors : How Nouns Movie enabled them to do something unthinkable, completely remotely.\n- Understanding the intricacies of Blus [Musical Score](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4OavIimoXs&ab_channel=AtriumAnimation).\n- Fun Trivia about the world [sound design](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7umbTCiMTmk&ab_channel=AtriumAnimation) with Jordan - our SFX Lead.\n\n#### First Casting call\n- Casting call complete. 15 characters from other Nouns-values aligned communities were selected to make cameo appearances through out the Episode 2.\nhttps://twitter.com/nounsmovie/status/1686797509765840896\n- We intend to do more of these along to way opening the world of Blus outwards for others to participate in.\n\n#### Team Expansion Announcements\n- Dan Waters\nhttps://twitter.com/nounsmovie/status/1693785090340643078\n\n\n### DApp / UI Updates\n- **Nouns.Movie** was created to publish the story (dedicated webapp built with minting UX on top of Zora & cumulative leaderboard built-in)\n- Added Multi-episode support. \n- Introduced Worldview mints: Inexpensive art mints from different locations from the world of Blus that adds to cumulative ranking on the leaderboard.\n- Dedicated Behind the scenes section for audience to watch and explore auxillary content.\n- Planned token-gating for streaming content.\n\n![](https://i.postimg.cc/1Xd6YyB7/11111.png)\n![](https://i.postimg.cc/fTsHzvSg/2222.png)\n\n---\n\n### Story Updates\n**Genre**: Action, Comedy\n\nScript for the delivered Episode 2 can be found [***here***](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gdInCNXaLvKA5Vrxe6aCTiOtE67jNpG6/view?usp=sharing)\n\n*We also created a rough outline of how the story progresses through completion.

Designed to be worn day and night, it reaches places that the Noggles glasses can't. This watch represents a powerful demonstration of what the Nouns community can achieve, extending the brand's narrative into an entirely new realm of self-expression. It seamlessly combines nounishness and horology, on the verge of becoming **the most personal and novel product Nouns has ever created**.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/PleFEx9.png)\n## The NounsWatch cc0 design: accessible to everyone\n\nCreated by renowned watch designer Rafael Miranda, the bold Noggle-inspired design is **half a watch and half a ⌐◨-◨**, literally.

It features an exquisite *mysterious hours* full day half display, with a glass mirror and a black dial.

His accolades include several design awards and publications in the watch industry.\n\nThe brand is committed to craft distinctive timepieces that stands out with innovative designs and groundbreaking features, including the use of pioneering materials and early adoption of web3 technology such as cryptocurrency, NFTs and metaverse experiences in the watch space.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/p8gK5Fi.png)\n\n![](https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1694722112/t9ce7v5l3t52g3azgydp.png)\n\n![](https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1694722042/xhyf0mdtyqkfiip0plmr.jpg)\n\n\n## Contemporary distribution methods\n\nDWISS also excels in modern distribution methods. Leveraging the power of crowdfunding and Direct-to-Consumer (D2C) strategies, launching multiple campaigns and mastering influencer and digital advertising. These accomplishments attest to DWISS's strong marketing and sales capabilities, setting a **solid foundation for the success of our Go-to-Market strategy for NounsWatch**.\n\nCrowdfunding campaigns that generated more than USD $1.5 million.\n![](https://i.imgur.com/U5gHT6Y.png)\n\nDwiss have a portfolio of influencers that have millions of followers especially in Youtube, but also instagram, facebook, blogs and magazines.\n![](https://i.imgur.com/JS08Qcu.png)\n\nDwiss masters Digital Advertising, generating 9.4 millions of impressions, and 109k clicks in 2023 alone.\n![](https://i.imgur.com/f3G84AV.png)\n\n---\n\n# A unparalleled opportunity to reach a new audience\n\nWe meticulously planned a winning Go-to-Market Strategy to make the most of it with optimal resources. **The NounsWatch collection seizes an unparalleled opportunity of introducing Nouns to a whole new audience.** \n\n## Step 0: Entering the Affordable Fashion Market\n\nIn an industry that generated over $70 billion in 2022, fashion ranks as the second most significant reason people wear watches, trailing only behind timekeeping. This largely accounts for why the fashion watch segment records the highest annual unit sales in the tens of millions. **The NounsWatch collection pricing and style aims to secure a position in the largest portion of this growing segment: the sub-$200 fashion watch market.**\n\nThat said, time to sell.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/DprKVhF.png)\n\n## Step 1: A pre-sale shortcut to meet 10 Million customers on Indiegogo\n\nA common challenge to IRL products is meeting the minimum order quantities (MOQ) whilst ensuring enough demand for the product. And for custom designed watches, the MOQ of 1000 pieces makes the equation a bit challenging. \n\nThanks to Dwiss successful track record on Indiegogo campaigns we can have a reputable access to create a Drop.\n\nAn Indiegogo Drop is an exclusive offer for qualified business that serves a discount pre-sale channel without the need for the regular crowdfunding. The highlight is the added layer of marketing to reach the fullest of Indiegogo’s 10 million monthly visitors and 1 million combined social media followers from 235 countries.\n\nDwiss will launch a NounsWatch Drop pre-sale for the price of ~~$189.00~~ $129.00 with [teaser videos and images](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7ZsbPHqzFw) that will feature Nouns on the homepage of the Indiegogo website, as well as in related content such as carousels, newsletters, and social media.\n\n**By doing so, we aim to generate sufficient demand for NounsWatch, particularly from outside the Nouns and watchmaking communities, thus bringing it closer to mainstream media and markets.**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/exRMxAh.png)\n\n## Step 2: Continuous sale on the NounsWatch Shopify store\n\nAfter the presale window concludes, sales will resume in our website [nounswatch.com](http://nounswatch.com/) for $189.00 ($169.00 for selected communities), where we will accept both fiat currency and cryptocurrency. Leveraging the same proven digital marketing strategy that Dwiss employs for its products, we are going to use a share of the sales profit in Digital Advertising to generate millions of impressions and drive hundreds of thousands of clicks to our website, until the point of delivery and after. If demand falls short, Dwiss name is in play. We bear the risk and will undertake the responsibility of selling the product.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/jIsZVSV.jpg)\n\n## Step 3: Ding-dong! Delivery Time\n\nUpon receiving the initial shipment from the factory, we'll start fulfilling orders through both Indiegogo and Shopify channels. At the same time, we'll ramp up our marketing efforts to stimulate new demand, focusing on a broad [influencer campaign and a user-generated content initiative](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5h5gh3ZqPzjm_Rrt6FKdrTbbJ00IF9Es). **This is a pivotal moment for the NounsWatch and Nouns history, and we are committed to maximizing its impact.**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/wztkALV.png)\n\n## Step 4: The NounsWatch Legacy\n\n**Spin the Flywheel (new!)**\nRegardless the supply, **10% of every NounsWatch collection sales revenue will be sent back to the Treasury** and submitted to Propdates. Assuming a pre-sale sold-out of 1000 pieces, the gross revenue would be $129,000. 10% of this ($12,900) goes back to the DAO treasury, further reducing the actual costs to the DAO. Sales out of the pre-sale window generate more revenue.\n\n**Release the IP (new!)**\nThe NounsWatch blueprint and 3d files **will be cc0, fully available on the public domain**.\n\n**Everyday, forever (new!)**\nThe objective for NounsWatch is not to exist as a limited edition, but rather to establish it as a standard product in the Dwiss partnership lineup. **We will sustain production for as long as consumer demand remains**, and may release new straps, models, and features when deemed appropriate.\n\n**Warranty and Customer Support**\nDwiss will provide a world-class ongoing support and warranty for customers after 2 years they have purchased NounsWatch.\n\n---\n\n## **Funds Allocation**\n\nWe have meticulously planned the budget to ensure optimal allocation of funds across all critical aspects of the project. Our financial strategy for V2 has been redesigned to sustain our competitive pricing strategy while accommodating the increased workload of the team until the sales take-off. \n\nWe have estimated the financial requirements for the NounsWatch project as follows:\n\n- $5,000 - Development\n- $90,000 - NounsWatch and straps (1,000 pieces)\n- $10,000 - Packaging\n- $25,000 - External Labor and Taxes\n- $14,000 - First-Class Video and 3D Production (third-party services)\n- $7,000 - Indiegogo Drop Paid Feature Package\n- $18,000 - Team Compensation\n\n**TOTAL ASK: $169,000 USDC**\nWallet: [dwiss.eth](https://etherscan.io/address/0x80b0b325D6A1E19953dFffb6Cc117263916796F8)\n\n## Timeline\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/UK7lhJP.png)\n\n---\n\n## Team\n\n[Fabio Seva](https://x.com/fabioseva) - Concept & Marketing\nLilNoun#125, nouns-pilled founder of [Public Good Beer](https://twitter.com/publicgoodbeer?s=21&t=OnA_W289RIsplarDuhpSrg)\n[Rafael Miranda](https://x.com/rsmiranda) - Design\nLilNoun#7753, watch designer and Dwiss founder\n[Dwiss](https://x.com/dwisswatch) - Production and operations\n\n---\n\n**Acknowledgments:** we would like to thank the dozens of comments we received during V1, which enabled us to develop this new version.

DWISS team says they are confident that it will, but they are also the team submitting the prop.\n\nso the arrangement that i would support is one that the DWISS team also takes some financial risk by putting up an amount of their own capital for the production of these units (we can give back 10% revenue return suggested in the prop; we generally don't ask for revenue back to treasury for physical goods sold). then ideally the team would risk losing money on the effort if none of the units sell and would have the opt to make money if all the units sell out. in this case we would be meaningfully subsidizing the production of the units but not covering all the costs such that the producer has no risk regardless of the outcome of sales.\n\nit's totally fair if that type of risk is not what the DWISS team thinks they want to take on but this is my view after having funded a decent amount of high priced physical goods that hasn't sold. it's entirely possible that we're not ready as a brand to make these types of items since we don't have enough fans to buy these high cost branded items and non fans have little reason to be interested. thanks again for the effort around the prop.

Looking forward to your thoughts!\n\n---\n\n*“Is Nouns activity growing?” “Who is helping increase engagement and spreading the meme?” “Which proposals are driving growth?” “What’s our spend rate?” “How many builders are contributing to the Nouns ecosystem?” “Are the amount of proposal candidates increasing?”*\n\n## **TL;DR**\n\nWe aim to create a single-purpose website where Nouns activity metrics are published. It will integrate activity across social channels and highlight which Nouns, advocates, and proposals have best supported the Noun’s meme propagation. Our creative motto is: *Track Memes, Not People.*\n\nAs a starting point, this proposal focuses on [1] onchain activity (supported by the Nouns subgraph), [2] two sources of social media (Farcaster and Instagram), and [3] a limited set of metrics — such as proposal submissions, votes, comments, posts, and engagement. Opportunistically, we will incorporate additional sources and expand the set of metrics.\n\n## Background\n\nAs of the moment, the Nouns’ community and audience members produce a wide variety of data. Over time, more data is likely to migrate onchain (e.g. similar to vote comments today) and data will be produced across even more digital localities. The *United World of Nouns* will have a wide-ranging data footprint. Combining data across these localities can become a powerful tool for proposal development and decision-making.\n\nHowever, as @Krel mentioned in their [Request for Proposers](https://www.notion.so/Nouns-DAO-Request-for-Proposers-94dadff999ac493b9902aa002e4b296e?pvs=21):\n\n> *“Nouns DAO does not have a reliable way to measure ‘growth’ or ‘success’. Its not clear what should be measured, or what growth in the context of Nouns even means.”*\n> \n\nThis project will create an initial repository of activity growth combining onchain and offchain data. We are long overdue to experiment on this front!\n\n## Scope\n\nThe metrics tracker will be in the form of a single-purpose web application.\n\nTo begin, we will include onchain data available in the Nouns Subgraph and two social media channels: Farcaster and Instagram. We will publish a selection of core metrics that provide clarity to Noun holders and the wider community.\n\nMost importantly, the underlying data pool (Meme Activity Database) will serve a first step towards a data-driven Nouns culture, which community members and potential builders can use to find opportunities for proposal submissions.\n\nSuccess of this project will be measured based on web application usage (unique visitors), proposal references (e.g. This project will increase X metric supporting Noun activity growth), and data pool connections (e.g. external usage of the Meme Activity Database).\n\nAs a stretch goal, we will look to expand the data sources, for example including key derivative NFT projects (Gnars, LilNouns, cc0-lib) and other dominant social spaces (Discord, Discourse, X, Lens, etc).\n\n*Note: X (formerly Twitter) has been deprioritized due to its cost ($5k per month) until initiative is proven useful. It would be included in future proposals.*\n\n*Note: Discord has been deprioritized due to its fragmentation (there multiple Nouns servers) until initiative is proven useful. It would be included in future proposals.*\n\n## Product Components\n\n### \n\nWhenever we want to test our internet speed, we can easily go to a speed test website. If we want to see how our activity on X (formerly Twitter), we can go to profile analytics. \n\n**Where do we go to check how the Nouns ecosystem is growing?** We go to *.*\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/ByD5JEHfp.png)\n\nThe Pulse is a single purpose website showcasing onchain and offchain activity metrics. This includes public conversations related to the **********************United World of Nouns.********************** The main graph, which we are currently calling *“Activity Momentum”* will showcase daily activity growth, a proxy for the Noun meme adoption and mind-share online.\n\nOur data analytics approach will combine methodologies from (1) traditional media broadcasting (e.g. combining data like number of views, replies, likes, proposal submissions, unique voters, etc.), (2) crypto-native metrics common across DAOs, and (3) materials science and engineering (read more about how engineers develop [material selection indexes here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Material_selection)).\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HJSJgVrGp.png)\n\nData will be synchronized in real-time directly from the Nouns’ Subgraph, Farcaster, Instagram to an SQL database. The sync mechanism will be architected in a uniform adapter interface for easier future integration with other onchain data and offchain sources, such as Twitter, Discourse, Discord, Telegram, DeSo, and Lens.\n\n**Example Onchain Metrics:**\n\n- Treasury\n- Treasury Usage Rate (Monthly Spend)\n- Burn Value\n- Candidate Props Growth\n- Proposal Submissions Growth\n- Active Proposals\n- Percent of Proposals Funded\n- Total Unique Builders\n- Average Auction Price\n\n**Example Offchain Metrics:**\n\n- Number of Posts\n- Total Engagement (Likes+Comments+Shares)\n- Engagement Rate (Ratio of Engagement to Posts)\n- Most Engaged Content\n- Total Followers\n- Follower Growth Rate (Updated based on API opportunity)\n- Noggles Score: Count of posts using “⌐◨-◨” on Farcaster*\n\n**In the first phase it won’t be possible to index Instagram posts by content, only be hashtags. As a result, the Noggles Score won’t be able to include Instagram posts.*\n\n### Meme Activity Database (a.k.a. The MAD)\n\nCurcially, the product’s underlying data model will be available for others to query and contribute to. That way, others can embed the index into their own Noun interfaces. Anyone should be able to get clean and reliable **meme-data-as-a-service** to support a diversity of Noun initiatives. Imagine a world where active proposals have conversation hype trackers, or ongoing projects can easily see total impressions across social media channels.\n\nAt the end of the day, we want to facilitate the use of data across the Nouns ecosystem. As the cc0 library enables media usage, the activity database enables tracking and impact analysis.\n\nThe Web API interface will be available publicly in the form of parametrizable JSON endpoints. The data will be distributed per specific sources (onchain Nouns, Farcaster, and others) as well as in aggregated form to enable the development of tools such as alerts, bots, and analytics dashboards.\n\n## Product Roadmap\n\nThe execution of this project will be done in an iterative fashion. By building in public and getting ongoing feedback, we can deliver what the community needs, and data that will support Nouns decisions.\n\n**Iterative Phases:**\n\n- **Phase 1:** Deliver basic UI w/ limited branding and processed Farcaster data displayed in form of metrics. Deliver mock-up UI for onchain metrics and Instagram metrics. Host open Q&A with Nouns (e.g. via Aburra) to gather community feedback.\n- **Phase 2:** Deliver basic UI w/ Farcaster metric feedback, plus Noun Subgraph indexing and onchain metrics. Host open Q&A (e.g. via Aburra) to gather community feedback.\n- **Phase 3:** Deliver basic UI w/ Farcaster, Onchain metric feedback, and Instagram metrics for specific accounts and hashtags. Host open Q&A (e.g. via Aburra) to gather community feedback.\n- **Phase 4:** Complete UI polishing and metrics calibration. Host open Q&A (e.g. via Aburra) to celebrate launch and discuss future opportunities (where next).\n\n## An Ambitious Vision\n\nThis project aims to uncover what “Nouns-Native” analytics could look like, and what data infrastructure is necessary to feed this analytics into the broader Nouns governance and participation process.\n\nWe’ve already intuited that we want to ***Track*** ***Memes, Not People*** — and we’re certain there will be other innovations along the way. After all, we need to address challenges in crossing the web3-to-web2 data pipeline chasm. Is it possible? We think so.\n\nNouns is a place for ambitious ideas, and we are an ambitious team.\n\n## Team\n\nThis project will be led and executed by Rafa Fernandez (Farcaster: @rafa) and Rafi Gutkowski (Farcaster: @rafi). \n\n- Rafa Fernandez is a community architect with a focus on building [Digital Public Utilities](https://www.notion.so/General-Networks-e4615b9b52294f8bab34a82b47023d11?pvs=21). He has decade of experience in corporate analytics and studied materials-science and engineering. He is the founder of Folklore (Folklore.Institute), a community that curates and commissions research on digital cultures. Most recently, he was part of the Summer of Protocols research program looking at [online swarms](https://www.notion.so/Welcome-to-the-Swarm-41c114211ac045f087c44c16bd993748?pvs=21). Previous to the program he worked at Mirror where he worked in creator partnerships and community development.\n- Rafi Gutkowski is a software engineer and data scientist ([libred.org](https://libred.org/), [LinkedIn](http://linkedin.com/in/rgutkowski)). He started mining bitcoin in 2015 but only after exiting from his recent startup, did he double down on web3. Since then Rafi has been working on sementic analysis of decentralized social graphs, as well as creating web3-web2 bridges, such as Folklore’s web3-signature to feed [broadcast applet](https://www.notion.so/Folklore-5d34757913064064b87119c4593eda74?pvs=21).\n\n## Funding\n\nWe are a stream of 22.5 ETH to fund this project over approximately 10 weeks.\n\nThe funds will be allocated to a two-person team (Rafa and Rafi). They are split roughly 25-75 between planning and iterative engineering. There is about a 40-40-10 between data engineering, visuals and handoff. There is approximately 10% reserved for bugs and issue resolution.\n\nWe expect that once the initial traunch of data engineering and visuals is complete, then we can make a decision on what the community needs more of (if anything), such as expanded data, or expanded analysis\n\n## Our Commitments\n\n- We commit to posting updates on [updates.wtf](https://updates.wtf/) with sprint plan and outcomes, in alignment with each of the community Q&A feedback sessions.\n- We commit to cancelling the stream based on community feedback.\n- We commit to executing this work as an open-source project, such that other onchain communities and organizations can benefit.\n\n## Other Notes\n\nThis proposal was built based on the Basic Nouns Proposal Template, built by Rafa and available here: https://hackmd.io/@rafathebuilder/BkPAmHZbp\n\nIf you’d like to learn more about this proposal, the first Q&A conversation on Aburra is available here: https://youtu.be/_dr2yZulMG","proposer":"0xe62d071Ea99A63798Fec7222c483c53e87F2A32E","startBlock":18492145,"endBlock":18520945,"executed":false},"votes":[{"support":1,"voter":"0x008c84421dA5527F462886cEc43D2717B686A7e4","numberOfVotes":9,"reason":"Vaya con Nounish Dios"},{"support":1,"voter":"0x2666f0C8FB58d182f2Dd79475DCA4A07B3724607","numberOfVotes":3,"reason":"Good data analysis for the future of nouns is needed to get us to that next step.

People involved in seemingly different fields, such as social contribution organizations and the web3 community, will gather together with the aim of creating new support and revenue methods that combine social problem solving and web3.\n\n- Simultaneously with the charity event, we will be hosting “Noggles Jack Nagoya” and the “web3 Community Exhibition,” expecting over 1,000 attendees. In line with the event, there will be talk sessions, Nouns' booths, workshops, promotional merchandise distributions, and planned social contribution activities.\n\n- Prior to the event, we will have a booth for Nouns at the Design Festa in Tokyo on Sunday, November 12, 2023. Following our previous Proposal 228 “Noggles Jack Tokyo,” this will be our second event where we will display and sell Nouns merchandise. Moreover, we will also be promoting “Bright Any Colors with ⌐◨-◨.”\n\n## Background & Challenges\n- While individuals possess various facets, society often fails to accept them, because it's easier to manage by measuring everyone against a uniform set of values, leading to a tendency to avoid complexity.\nI believe that the biggest societal issue lies in the attempt to oversimplify intricate matters. Many people in today's society are bound by existing frameworks, having forgotten how to create new concepts and systems on their own accord.\n\n- The utilization of web3 technology for societal transformation is in an trial phase, but leveraging Nouns' autonomous decentralized system has the potential to assist.\nThere's a need for support towards technology that encourages “pluralistic” decision-making and collaboration, as well as the activities that accompany it.\n\n- In October 2022, the United Nations Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities pointed out that Japan's education for persons with disabilities is lagging behind and made [recommendations.](https://docstore.ohchr.org/SelfServices/FilesHandler.ashx?enc=6QkG1d%2FPPRiCAqhKb7yhsox6sZe%2Fik6d3iDJzISRPhvIaActFR9I%2FAIZ%2Be8dEYc3x9pGI%2BAqnUjiYnhf%2BzLRJLqW2mBzZdcaW0%2B10tvwrA97qOnmCuV89Qwl7dhkmc1B) However, there has been still no progress in understanding and awareness of disabilities, and the separation of special needs education from regular classes has been seen as a problem.\nFurthermore, research and studies on rare and congenital diseases are struggling due to the influence of market principles and an emphasis on efficiency.\n\n- “Bright Any Colors” is aimed at supporting individuals with disabilities, children, and students. Participants will be able to exchange opinions within the event, increasing the potential for new ideas and solutions to emerge.\n\n## Theme & Objectives\n“Bright Any Colors with ⌐◨-◨” aims to enjoyably learn about DAOs through Nouns, aspiring to pave the way for a future where everyone shines their brightest. Our passion for enhancing the lives of all resonates with the public, and we've designed this event hoping that the concepts and systems of web3 naturally gain broader recognition. Relying on the insights and experiences from this endeavor, we will continuously engage in activities that leverage web3 technology to address societal challenges. We will host events 3-4 times a year, striving for widespread awareness and education.\n\n## Event Overview\n### Dec 23, 2023 Event & Workshop\n![](https://eibakatsu.com/bac/2.png)\n\n- **A talk session will be held on the stage of the gymnasium.**\nOur special guests for this event will be Ms. Chizuru Azuma, an actor who has been actively involved in social contribution activities for over 30 years, and Mr. paji, a research expert in DAO and Co-Planner at pNouns.\nThe theme will be an explanation of the full-fledged DAO \"Nouns\" and its applicability to social issues.\n　\nFor example…the funding mechanism by Nouns DAO What is \"Treasury Wallet\"?\nWe'll introduce its structure, potential applications, and other real-life examples, all tailored for beginners.\nNouns-related images and videos will be projected using a projector into the visual stage production.\n\n- **Booth exhibition by social contribution organizations.**\nWe will introduce initiatives by organizations supporting people with disabilities, children, and students, as well as employment support facilities, as well as sell products and conduct educational activities.\n\n- **Invited event company \"NFT COLOR\" together the actively active web3 community in Japan Exhibiting NFT art works,** introducing the community, and interacting with social contribution organizations.\n\n### Event Proposal\n#### Various Workshops\n![](https://eibakatsu.com/bac/3.png)\n\nMs. Chizuru Azuma is in charge of the planning, composition, casting, direction, costume design, and overall supervision of the [“MAZEKOZE Island Tour,”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waK22pnvFRY) which is being streamed worldwide as one of the events of the “Tokyo 2020 NIPPON Festival.”\n\n[Using the theatrical arts to create a more diverse society](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waK22pnvFRY) | Chizuru Azuma | TEDxKyoto\n\n### Location\n#### Nagono Campus\n![](https://eibakatsu.com/bac/4.png)\n[\"Nagono Campus\"](https://nagono-campus.jp/englishguide/) is located in Nagoya City, Aichi Prefecture.\n\n### Phase\n![](https://eibakatsu.com/bac/5.png)\n\n### Advatages of simultaneous event in Tokyo and Nagoya\n![](https://eibakatsu.com/bac/6.png)\n\nAt the event \"Noggles Jack Tokyo\" held on May 20th and 21st, 2023, Nouns became widely known to the general public through Noggles.\nAt the charity event \"Bright Any Colors with ⌐◨-◨,\" we will set up a \"Noggles Jack Nagoya\" booth.\nJust like last time, attendees can enjoy Nouns characters and Noggles.

To achieve **self-sustaining long term** proliferation globally via the distribution and adoption of cc0 Nouns themed play-structures design.\n\n![A3Dgxek.png](https://i.imgur.com/A3Dgxek.png)\n\n**As a builder in Nouns:**\n1. To inspire community members to **leverage their networks** and create impactful proposals.\n2. Become an **enabler for Nouns community** to ease interactions with both well-established brands and non-crypto organizations.\n3. Showcase the **versatility** of Nouns' cc0 assets.\n\n**Strategy (Focus on long-term continuity):**\n- Use this Nouns Themed Playground as a monument that compliment the open-source design kit.  \n    - Showcase the design and instill trust in its playability.\n    - Distribute open-source design to at least 10 industry professionals and **incorporate** our Nouns themed play-structures **in their product catalogs**\n    - Expand Nouns network value and **boost adoption** of Nouns themed play-structures.\n    - Scale Nouns themed play-structures organically\n- Submit this Nouns Themed Playground project to architecture platform like [ArcDaily](https://www.archdaily.com/); to **gain attention from new audience** into Nouns.\n*(we are already in contact with ArcDaily CN curator)*\n    - Open-source design kit will be uploaded but not limited to: github, cco-library, platform like Arcdaily, Bimstore, etc.\n    - Allowing anyone who can build it in their region to plug and build easily.\n- Apart from a **high quality documentary** to tell our story, we will also leverage on media partners.\n    - Sharing BTS footage as short format videos, to **rally attention,** **enhance curiosity**, bringing fans along on this journey, as we show progression and erect our first Nouns Themed Playground.\n        - Content will be shared on but not limited to: X, Farcaster, IG, Tiktok, Youtube, Little Red Book, etc.\n        - New fans are also able to ask questions about Nouns along this journey.\n    - Prop progression will also be shared and updated timely on [Propdates.wtf](https://www.propdates.wtf/)\n\n## **Nouns Themed Play-Structures**\nOn top of the initial batch of play-structures, we will also identify **additional 4 Nouns characters** with the design team. These will also be created into play structures and release as part of our open-source design kit, to provide a more **diverse range** of play options which would help boost adoption.    \n\nBelow are the initial batch of play-structure design:\n![PvesMIo.png](https://i.imgur.com/PvesMIo.png)\n![fixz9u4.png](https://i.imgur.com/fixz9u4.png)\n![YkWRXSB.png](https://i.imgur.com/YkWRXSB.png)\n![djZZ0Ad.png](https://i.imgur.com/djZZ0Ad.png)\n\n![iUgJbGz.png](https://i.imgur.com/iUgJbGz.png)\n![gkAgf1V.png](https://i.imgur.com/gkAgf1V.png)\n\n![plrxaMQ.png](https://i.imgur.com/plrxaMQ.png)\n\n![nnoE35D.png](https://i.imgur.com/nnoE35D.png)\n![1ntFyVf.png](https://i.imgur.com/1ntFyVf.png)\n![Z0XcwVm.png](https://i.imgur.com/Z0XcwVm.png)\n![TOfLCiK.png](https://i.imgur.com/TOfLCiK.png)\n![6B1HsP6.png](https://i.imgur.com/6B1HsP6.png)\n![FAesqnE.png](https://i.imgur.com/FAesqnE.png)\n\n\n### **Site Visual**\n![pPKg3fq.png](https://i.imgur.com/pPKg3fq.png)\n![RyDHDCm.png](https://i.imgur.com/RyDHDCm.png)\n\n## **FAQ:**\n**1.

The more crucial question we ask ourselves is the rate of adoption with these designs (cc0 assets) alone. How impactful will it be without a physical playground that is enjoyed by everyone to support it? Take the example of Nouns movie—considering impact versus cost, would funding only the creation of characters as cc0 assets be as impactful as funding the development of a complete Nouns movie? What would be the adoption rate for these assets if we rely on animation houses to pick them up, compared to having a fully realized Nouns movie that showcases the potential of Nounish animated characters, inherently cc0 in nature to boost adoption? The same principles apply to Nouns themed play-structures.\n\n+1 prof \nBeyond the build, our goal is to drive/boost adoption, encouraging other industry professionals to utilize cc0 Nouns themed play-structures, thereby sparking a Nounish playground market/network.

If you're interested, [apply]([link](https://tally.so/r/3NlAMB)) and mention Nouns.\n- Support BasePaint crypto native artists \n- Make our first transaction on an L2!\n\nI've been in contact with the cofounders of BasePaint ([Zach](zherring) and [WINTΞR](https://twitter.com/w1nt3r_eth)) to set the themes for the days on which Nouns would be minting. \n\n## Logistics:\n- We’d be using the [BasePaint bot](https://www.basepaintbot.com/) to commit the ETH. \n- The proposal would be calling [Base Portal contract on Ethereum](https://etherscan.io/address/0x49048044D57e1C92A77f79988d21Fa8fAF74E97e#readProxyContract) which would both deposit and call the [BasePaint bot contract](https://basescan.org/address/0xb129419F9B035E9d80B4a320ffcf5BE93Cb7994B#code). \n- We'd be minting 699 each day (at a cost of 0.00286 per mint) for a total of 1.9999 ETH per day (699 * 0.00286).\n- The mints would be under the [DAO's alias address](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/develop/specs/deposits.md#address-aliasing) so that the DAO can call it from L1 if it chooses to move them.\n\n\n## Timeline:\n\n- Assuming the proposal passes, the mint would start 9 days after the proposal is put onchain (7 days vote turnaround + 2 days queued). \n\n## Where the ETH would go:\nThere’s a 10% fee that the BasePaint bot takes at mint. Once minted, 90% of the profits of the OE are distributed to the artists proportional to the number of pixels they painted. 10% goes to the protocol.\n\n--- \n\n*A big thank you to [solimander](https://x.com/_solimander_), [backseats](https://x.com/backseats_eth) and [wilson](https://x.com/wilsoncusack) who helped put the tx together*","proposer":"0xb0dd496FffFa300df1EFf42702066aCa81834404","startBlock":18537673,"endBlock":18566473,"executed":true},"votes":[{"support":1,"voter":"0xb0dd496FffFa300df1EFf42702066aCa81834404","numberOfVotes":4,"reason":"Note to artists:\nThe link for artists to apply for brushes is broken.

If you include our various other nounish Spaces as well, the total year-to-date jumps to 857 Spaces, which equates to 921 total hours on air, or a total of **38 full days of broadcasting nounish content**, with a total of **37,800** cumulative listeners. \n\n[![spaces-stats-red-bg.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/d1xdLB4R/spaces-stats-red-bg.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/wyD3rhK3)\n*YTD stats from Superspaces.ai*\n\nOn top of our daily Spaces participation, we have seen tremendous X/Twitter timeline engagement from the TNS community on our art contests, video content and other daily posts, with an impressive **5.9 Million impressions** so far year to date, which equates to nearly 20,000 impressions, 215 Likes and 112 Re-Posts per DAY.

(Not a Nouns-funded project per se, but Brennen is a Nouner and we like the duck.)  \n- Collaborating with Lil Nouns DAO's The Lil Nouns Show, and producing a feature video on their funded Lil Bevs proposal (tentative release date late November.)\n- Collaborating with subDAOs such as Lil Nouns DAO, Gnars, Food Nouns, Nouns Amigos, Nouns Japan, NounsCN, Nouns BR and more to host and cohost regular spaces for their communities.\n\n\n\n---\n\n**Discovering and Empowering Nounish Artists:**\n\nOur art contests have continued to be very popular in terms of engagement, and also continue to impress in terms of quality and quantity of output. Here are a couple examples of winning entries from some of our many art contests this year:\n\n**Nounish Halloween Contest**\n\n[![halloween-contest-gif.gif](https://i.postimg.cc/wBDnZ878/halloween-contest-gif.gif)](https://x.com/thenounsquare/status/1719770338379141525?s=20)\n\n**TNS Anniversary Art Contest Winners**\n\n[![anniversary-contest-gif.gif](https://i.postimg.cc/28nVS3qP/anniversary-contest-gif.gif)](https://x.com/thenounsquare/status/1668684529484148736?s=20)\n\n\n\nWe constantly see new people tuning into our Spaces and engaging with our content, asking questions about Nouns, etc. in the days following an art contest. This is part of the reason why we have centered the vision of our upcoming Yellow Collective launch around funding and empowering as many nounish artists and creatives as possible (more below.)\n\n\n\n---\n\n**Crowd-Sourced \"FOMO\" Auction Settling:**\n\nSpeaking of art, another way that TNS has contributed to the Nouns ecosystem is by making a fun daily spectacle of choosing the new Noun of the Day on Noun O' Clock LIVE. \n\nWith the help of our audience, we have settled some pretty amazing Nouns this year, including some special ones for occasions, such as a Halloween Ghost, a Birthday Cake for Aug 8, a Black Cat for Token 666, etc. Some of these aesthetic Nouns have sold at auction for above-average prices, even despite the fork dynamic. Noun 658 (Dark Factory) for example **sold for 51 ETH, a full 25 ETH more than the average Noun was going for at that time.**\n\nWe also challenged ourselves earlier this year to try and mint every unminted Noun head, and succeeded just prior to the 2nd Nouniversary. We then challenged ourselves again to mint all the newly added heads as quickly as possible, and succeeded in less than 2 weeks. As a result, **[Proposal 401](https://nouns.wtf/noun/904)** was able to award every contributing artist an existing Noun with their own created head. \n\nHere is a small selection of the many very aesthetic Nouns we helped to mint so far this year: \n\n[![aesthetic-nouns.gif](https://i.postimg.cc/vB6qcD16/aesthetic-nouns.gif)](https://postimg.cc/0MPd4k08)\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n# 2) A Fresh Focus on Video Content:\n\nDuring the earliest months of this season, TNS was producing and facilitating an average of 40 Twitter/X Spaces per week for various nounish communities. We sought and received feedback from nouners and our audience, and learned that their favorite content was our educational/informative video content on YouTube and TikTok, and so we decided as a team to shift our resources and attention towards **increasing the production of this kind of rich media content on a more regular basis.**\n\nSince that time, we have been producing an average of 5-8 high quality pieces of video content per month. Here are some notable examples of content produced by TNS this year: \n\n\n\n---\n\n**This Week in Nouns** Series (FKA Prop Talk): A 3 minute weekly video summarizing everything exciting that's happening in Nouns. Primarily an **[X-native release](https://twitter.com/search?q=%40thenounsquare%20%22this%20week%20in%20nouns%22&src=typeahead_click)**, these have received a combined **70,000+ views** so far this year.\n\n[![twin-gif-for-prop.gif](https://i.postimg.cc/D0Mn1F5S/twin-gif-for-prop.gif)](https://x.com/thenounsquare/status/1709595587232890942?s=20)\n*(Click GIF to Watch Video)*\n\n\n\n---\n\n**Crypto Advocacy / Gitcoin:** Nouns doesn't celebrate its wins often enough, so we decided to make a **[short video about our 100K donation to the Gitcoin Crypto Advocacy Round.](https://x.com/thenounsquare/status/1678837682565152770?s=20)** This piece of evergreen content has received nearly **30,000 views so far.** \n\n[![gitcoin-gif-for-prop.gif](https://i.postimg.cc/T2qk1ChX/gitcoin-gif-for-prop.gif)](https://x.com/thenounsquare/status/1678837682565152770?s=20)\n*(Click GIF to Watch Video)*\n\n---\n\n**Nouns AI pod** asked us to produce an engaging video about everything they had built in 2023. This was primarily an X release, but you can also watch it **[here on YouTube.](https://youtu.be/dvRuodQLXoc?si=Sv1NobSjXa8aK5Mu)**\n\n[![nounsai-gif-for-prop.gif](https://i.postimg.cc/j2mCtyp3/nounsai-gif-for-prop.gif)](https://youtu.be/dvRuodQLXoc?si=Sv1NobSjXa8aK5Mu)\n*(Click GIF to Watch Video)*\n\n---\n\n**Tutorials and Educational Videos About Onchain Life:** Our community loves learning about Ethereum, how to use L2s, how to apply for grants, etc. and our TNS Tutorials Series helps them along that path. Our **[Tutorials videos](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLTVC2ZZHVXuBM692fS5fW15VZ0tGBjts1&si=vsbbrErNy6ILUUuh)** have accumulated over **50,000 views** this year across our socials. \n\n[![Screen-Shot-2023-11-06-at-4-26-47-PM.png](https://i.postimg.cc/NfxfNqMP/Screen-Shot-2023-11-06-at-4-26-47-PM.png)](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLTVC2ZZHVXuBM692fS5fW15VZ0tGBjts1&si=vsbbrErNy6ILUUuh)\n*(Click Image to Visit Playlist)*\n\n\n---\n\n**Notable Video Archives of Popular Twitter Spaces** Events such as our **[All About that Base event](https://youtu.be/U1B50NrIqVM?si=X7vDN5QEnIryZ2oC)** featuring Jesse Pollak, this Nouns **[RageQuit Debate](https://youtu.be/cRG2Zb3Cz4Q)** moderated by the Verbs team, this **[open discussion of Private Voting](https://youtu.be/K_EC54dSf80)**, this CC0 Round-table with **[Danny Cole and David Horvath](https://youtu.be/MSf-Aevh5Dk)**, etc.\n\n\n\n---\n\nThe **Zero Rights Reserved Podcast:** We are 16 episodes in so far and growing in popularity, with over **350,000 views** so far in 4 just months. (More on this initiative in the dedicated section below.)\n\n[![zeropod-website-header-thing-copy.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/PxhqMF5z/zeropod-website-header-thing-copy.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/hJygDsxf)\n\n\n---\n\n\nIn addition to our long-form content, we have also continued to leverage our TNS **[TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/@thenounsquare?_t=8h8pOJQlvBn&_r=1)** **[Accounts](https://www.tiktok.com/@thenounsquarebr?_t=8h8pKkn4Zmi&_r=1)** to repurpose shorter versions of our videos, and platform-native shorts. We've continued to grow our English language and Brazilian Portuguese language accounts this year to a combined 38,500 followers, and have received over **150,000 views** on our short videos there YTD.  \n\n**Year-to-date, our video content has received over 650,000 views across our socials,** with 70% of that content coming in the latter part of the Season following our renewed emphasis on video production. We hope to continue this momentum into Season 3 and **surpass 1 million+ video views over the next 6 months.**\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n\n# 3) The Zero Rights Reserved Podcast: Early Signs of Success\n\n[![zero-rights-reserved-intro-gif.gif](https://i.postimg.cc/bJRYx7HT/zero-rights-reserved-intro-gif.gif)](https://postimg.cc/sQvRy0LQ)\n\n[**Zero Rights Reserved**](https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/toady-hawk) is a weekly video podcast that we launched in June as part of our renewed focus on creating more rich digital media. It is a podcast about Nouns, DAOs, Ethereum, Art and more, and our goal is to interview interesting guests from around the onchain space from a Nounish perspective, while entertaining and educating our audience and bridging gaps to other like-minded communities. \n\nSo far, the podcast has been getting very good feedback from listeners both inside and outside the nouns community, as well as from the guests that we have hosted so far:\n\n[![zeropod-feedback.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/fW785HM2/zeropod-feedback.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/V569kWrn)\n\n**Here is the list of our incredible guests so far:**\n- **[Jack Butcher](https://youtu.be/V4raMn3pCjQ?si=WcWJ-6vuUY9W3T26)** (Checks, Opepen, Visualize Value)\n- **[Bob Burnquist](https://youtu.be/2E13m-nsD9U?si=0c5uJ9vO3_q3y_6a)** (Skateboarding Legend)\n- **[Dan Romero](https://youtu.be/l4K9B53F8w0?si=JCVlUbBl5oi8JDI1)** (Farcaster Founder)\n- **[Luca Netz](https://youtu.be/HUZe7z_EORs?si=-pwrmaolOemr1e-Y)** (CEO Pudgy Penguins)\n- **[Chris Waters and Eric Towner](https://youtu.be/05B5BsWHF44?si=r6kLBMXPMU7eLmF7)** (Stoopid Buddy)\n- **[Supriyo](https://youtu.be/4RRQ_GqOzq8?si=-d9W9HqPs3zJE-Eg)** (Atrium, Nouns: A Movie)\n- **[Nate Angell](https://youtu.be/leNyYe4k6MA?si=B8hRbrK2eB3k5Rpz)** (Creative Commons)\n- **[Azeem Khan and Ben West](https://youtu.be/fAPxyHl_Yhk?si=TDOR3I66ntRPvAxt)** (Gitcoin)\n- **[Chris Carella](https://youtu.be/3JjblckvKZI?si=Zz7JZ4ppERV8-wQE)** (Purple, Energy)\n- **[Psych](https://youtu.be/1f6sUZlL1wE?si=ZUen2zhbXLWFeOl6)** (Cofounder Deadfellaz)\n- **[Snax](https://youtu.be/4xIL4vooNfM?si=sm57AU-X03NPQyad)** (Founder, Pizza DAO)\n- **[CryptoPunk Noah](https://youtu.be/lka91nApcc0?si=HAd6GsbRJ9oeMPAo)** (Artist, Prev Christie's, Yuga)\n- **[Amanda Terry](https://youtu.be/cD7J6QdrK28?si=cdOTMEiIsJ-XECw5)** (Cofounder, OnChainMonkey)\n- **[Aubtoshi](https://youtu.be/rrthX1cUxJY?si=WwVkI1h7PE3vbAwk)** (Nouns OTG)\n- **[Ed Balloon](https://youtu.be/1f6sUZlL1wE?si=Wbtabhx64GkXqUYI)** (Artist, Musician)\n- **[Binji Pande](https://youtu.be/V4raMn3pCjQ?si=fro8Y-Fbf1_oeS_B)** (Optimism Collective, OPLabs)\n\n*Upcoming guests (already recorded): Vinnie Hager, Grace and Brian Guan (founders of Unlonely.)*\n\n\n[![optimized-zzr-16-gif.gif](https://i.postimg.cc/RFWGKmBr/optimized-zzr-16-gif.gif)](https://postimg.cc/njtvf6rT)\n\n\n\n**ZEROPOD** has also proven to be our most popular piece of recurring video content so far, racking up over **350K impressions across TNS socials for the first 16 episodes.** Podcast subscriptions and downloads are all steadily growing, and from a human-impact perspective, the initiative has been a great bridge to other values-aligned communities such as **Gitcoin, Checks/Opepen, Deadfellaz, OnChainMonkey, Optimism and more.** We have started to see more and more people from these other communities joining Noun O' Clock LIVE regularly to learn more about Nouns after having their interest piqued by the pod! \n\nOur goal for this next season is to continue to grow the podcast, **exceeding 1 million views across our socials for all episode content**, while continuing to attract similar high-caliber guests, and spending more resources on repurposing this abundance of nounish content into shorter vertical videos for use on TikTok, Instagram and YouTube shorts. \n\nWe have also been minting each episode of ZEROPOD as a special ONCHAIN collection on Zora using the Zora L2 network. **[You can check them out and mint them all for free here.](https://zora.co/collect/zora:0x20035fea4dd659553233fe5ea3ca207e6427b5eb)**\n\nLike all of our content at TNS, and as the name would imply, Zero Rights Reserved is fully CC0, and we have started to compile a simple repository of both raw and edited footage that anyone is free to use however they see fit. **You can view and use the repository[ here.](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1bu09bV8M0DwiPQyWhU9lTE7cI2vJT34r?usp=sharing)**\n\n**We believe ZEROPOD has the potential to become our co-flaship production alongside Noun O' Clock LIVE. The former bringing in nouns-curious eyeballs from all over the web 3 space, while the latter acts as an effective sieve to catch artists and creatives and help them find ways to contribute meaningfully to the community.**\n\n\n\n---\n\n# 4) A Note About Team Adaptability\n\nAs mentioned previously, in the early part of this year, TNS was managing and facilitating up to 40 Twitter Spaces per week for communities such as Gnars, Lil Nouns, Unouns, Nouns Amigos, and more via our **SoapBox Program**. \n\nWhile we do maintain that the SoapBox program was impactful, and was certainly appreciated in many corners of the nouniverse, it also demanded a **lot** of labor to maintain in terms of scheduling, administration, social media messaging, hosting and coordination. As we started to receive feedback from Nouns DAO members that they did not feel SoapBox should be a primary focus for TNS, we made the difficult decision to mostly wind it down.\n\nSo as not to leave our communities in the lurch, we did the social media equivalent of making SoapBox \"open source\": We created a new X account called **TNS OpenMic**, where any nounsfolk can apply to host a show about any nounish community or topic of their choosing. We will still amplify where possible, but without the previous commitment of in-house scheduling, messaging, hosting, etc. Our vision for OpenMic is that it can act as a Public Access Channel for Nouns, where anyone can show up and spin up a Space with a built-in audience to iterate and try things out, but without the high administrative burden on TNS.\n\nAs a result of these and other changes to our day-to-day operations, we were able to stretch our previous mandate from 6 months to 9 months, and are presenting today a proposal that is almost 60% leaner than previoius asks.  \n\n\n\n---\n\n# 5) Promising Progress on Self-Funding & Alternative Funding Sources\n\nOne of our primary goals in Season 2 was to explore alternate sources of funding to become more self-sufficient as an organization, and we have explored this priority from three main angles: 1) Sponsorship collaborations, 2) Grants from other sources, and 3) Crypto Native revenue generation. \n\nOn item 1, we were able to negotiate 4 collaborations with values-aligned organizations plus a one-off video commission, for a total ETH value of 5.5 ETH. Thank you to Dawn Wallet, Gnars DAO and OnChainMonkey for being open to these collaborations so far. We are currently in discussions with various other organizations and protocols as well for future month-long content sponsorship opportunities. \n\nSecondly, we were extremely grateful to be awarded a Gitcoin Public Goods grant of 2.5 ETH for outstanding work in Web 3 Education and Onboarding, and a 5 ETH grant from Builder DAO to seed the imminently launching Yellow Collective treasury with funds to be used for nounish art contests and content commissions.\n\nAnd finally, we have brought in a total of 9.14 ETH YTD from our NOMO Nouns Daily Edition mints over the course of Season 2. We have also been iterating and evolving the NOMO collection and experience to make it more accessible for our audience. This summer, we migrated the collection to the Optimism L2 to solve the problem of a $7 daily mint that was costing $50 in gas to mint. Recently, we also made the decision to lower the mint cost from ~$7 to ~$1 to again encourage more broad participation from our community on a daily basis. \n\nWith these four sources combined, we have so far raised **22.14 ETH in outside revenue and grants, and we hope to double this amount in Season 3.**\n\nOne way that we will attempt to do that is with the launch of The Yellow Collective, a new TNS onchain club that will be deployed this month as a daily nounish auction on the BASE L2 using Nouns Builder. \n\n\n\n---\n\n# 6) Nouns on the OP Stack\n\n[![op-stack-infinity-stones-meme.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/j5LfcxDh/op-stack-infinity-stones-meme.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/JDCt4Wcy)\n\nWe noticed an interesting problem when talking to our community: Many wanted to \"Enjoy Ethereum\", but they were fed up with paying high gas fees on mainnet to do so. We decided to make it part of our mandate to teach our 50,000+ followers across socials about the benefits of using OP Stack L2 chains, and show them exactly how to do it.\n\nFirst, we migrated our daily edition collection \"NOMO Nouns\" from mainnet to OP, and produced some helpful tutorials on how to bridge ETH. Next, we started minting our Zero Rights Reserved podcasts as FREE mint collectibles on Zora L2 (shout out Jacob for helping us with this rollout.) \n\nFinally, we are in the midst of launching a \"DAO\" (onchain club) on BASE L2 using Nouns Builder this month, called The Yellow Collective. This Collective will be primarily focused on empowering artists and creatives through art contests and commissions, with collection art created by our community for our community. Check out the results of our **[Prop House Round for the first 50 heads here](https://prop.house/the-yellow-collective/the-yellow-collective-trait-contest-1:-best-noun-heads)**, and learn more about our plans for The Yellow Collective, and the BASE-deployed \"Collective Nouns\" daily auctions in our **[official announcement thread here.](https://x.com/thenounsquare/status/1704895027401417019?s=20)**\n\nThis diagram may also help to illustrate our three-pronged strategy for educating the Nouns community about the OP Stack, and the importance of Ethereum L2s:\n[![cr-w-2480-h-1240.webp](https://i.postimg.cc/mkHSPzMh/cr-w-2480-h-1240.webp)](https://postimg.cc/dZJCX05K)\n\n\nOne of our core ideals as an organization is to help create a safe and accessible place for people from all over the world to be able to Enjoy Nouns, and we are excited to leverage these L2 initiatives to do exactly that.  \n\nAnd on top of that, we're also just very excited for these Collective Nouns auctions to start... just look at these community-drawn traits! \n\n[![yellow-collective-finalists.gif](https://i.postimg.cc/65L0kWhh/yellow-collective-finalists.gif)](https://prop.house/the-yellow-collective/the-yellow-collective-trait-contest-1:-best-noun-heads)\n\n\n\n---\n\n# Our Guiding Goals for Season 3:\n\n- Remain consistent with our daily Twitter/X spaces and continue our current upward trajectory of followers and engagement on that platform, which would bring us to more than 14,000 followers, and a 6-month total of 1 million+ content impressions.\n- Grow and improve both the podcast and our YouTube channel content (which is already the second-largest channel in the nouniverse with 450 subscribers and also the fastest-growing channel with 150% subscriber growth this year.) We are targeting a similar rate of growth to hit our goal of 1000 Subscribers. As a baseline, we plan to produce and distribute at least 30 high quality pieces of video content in Season 3. \n- Make Zero Rights Reserved our co-flagship production alongside Noun O' Clock LIVE, leaning into the current momentum. (We have already recorded 1 month of future episodes with exciting guests like Vinnie Hager and the founders of Unlonely, still to air.)\n- Allocate more time and resources on making and using short clips from past and future ZEROPOD episodes for use on TikTok, Instagram and YT shorts (which are great content in and of themselves and also great drivers of listeners and subscribers back to the podcast.)\n- Double the total amount of funding from TNS initiatives and outside sources to at least 40 ETH. \n- Grow The Yellow Collective into the premiere nounish DAO (onchain club) on BASE as an accessible way for fans to discover nouns with the benefits of L2.  \n- Continue our mission of discovering and empowering nounish artists and creatives with the proceeds from daily auctions, running at least 20 contests for artists and creatives. \n- Update the Nouns community at minimum every 60 days with an onchain post on Propdates.wtf.\n\n# Budget and Requested Funding\n\nWe are requesting **130 ETH (~6 Nouns' worth at current FMV) for 6 months of operations** and our expected operational budgeting can be broken down as follows:\n\n-Art Contest Prizes Administration: 2 ETH/mo\n-Social Accounts Management: 3 ETH/mo\n-Spaces Hosting (NOC + All Others, Approx 50/month): 4.5 ETH/mo\n-Podcast organization, interviews, editing, production, distribution, etc: 4.5ETH/mo\n-Other Video Content Production and Distribution (This Week in Nouns, educational content, nouns project highlights, etc.): 3 ETH/mo\n-Short content creation and distribution for TikTok, instagram, YT reels, etc.: 1.5 ETH/mo\n-General Administration (Event Scheduling, Interview Scheduling, Prize Distribution, etc): 3 ETH/mo\n\n**Total expected budget operational cost per month: 21.5 ETH = 130 ETH Total**\n\n\n---\n\n\n**Core Team:**\n-**[Toady Hawk:](https://twitter.com/toady_hawk)** Project management, strategy, Spaces hosting, podcast hosting, video ideation, production, editing & distribution, social media management, administration.\n-**[Robotfishgirl](https://twitter.com/RobotFishGirl)**: Spaces hosting, discord moderation, strategy\n-**[JackWyldes:](https://twitter.com/JackWyldes)** Video ideation, production, hosting, editing.\n-**[Benbodhi](https://twitter.com/benbodhi)**: Prize distribution, discord admin, strategy.\n-**[Xargs:](https://twitter.com/mamaxargs)** Discord admin, general administration, scheduling, international outreach\n-**[Santhosh:](https://)** Scheduling, video editing, short video editing\n-**[Joshua Fisher](https://twitter.com/JoshuaFisher)**: Art Contest Coordination and administration\n-**[Symbiotech:](https://twitter.com/Symbiotech)** Social media management, Discord moderation, NOMO community\n\n**Other Contributors:** [Cardno](https://twitter.com/CardnoNFT), [BrettDrawsStuff](https://twitter.com/BrettDrawsStuff), [Nikki](https://twitter.com/web3nikki), [JP](https://twitter.com/eusou_jp), [Davin](https://twitter.com/davinoyesigye), [SuperTightWoody](https://twitter.com/SuperTightWoody), [Macki](https://twitter.com/_mackinac), [Satori](https://twitter.com/0xSatori).\n\nCore Team will collaborate to allocate funds to team members based on their contributions to the **weekly operations tasks budgets** outlined above.\n\n\n\n---\n\n**Trusted 3/6 Multisig Members:**\nRobotfishgirl\nBenbodhi\nSupertightWoody\n[Maty.eth](https://twitter.com/matyETH)\nToady Hawk\n[Noun 142](https://twitter.com/noun142)\n\n\n\n---\n\n**We would like to thank Nouns for all of the opportunity and trust you have given TNS over the past 18 months, and we ask for your continued support here as we set out to do more with less and make an increasingly positive and tangible impact on the Nouniverse over the next 6 months.**\n\nIf you have any questions for us about the Proposal, please don't hesitate to pose a question here onchain, DM or post on X/Twitter or Farcaster @thenounsquare, or drop in our [TNS Discord](https://discord.gg/vh9TQbtR). \n\n**LFG!

A team of that size where significant portion is admin work (discord mod, scheduling, etc) seems bloated. \n- Be more ambitious w goals. 9k to 14k followers / 450 to 1,000 subs / 1M impressions over 6 months feels like a lot is being left on the table. Even if you aim to 10x your distribution and fall short, the journey will likely lead to more interesting outcomes.\n\nBest of luck and much love to the team."},{"support":0,"voter":"0x008c84421dA5527F462886cEc43D2717B686A7e4","numberOfVotes":9,"reason":"Lean and slim and focused like Seneca said"},{"support":1,"voter":"0x7F0729f971CACE573732a9839500ED83Ba275F0E","numberOfVotes":2,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x79D0AE37e6506Ccf1385FC118459b329C67b54f5","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0xAae8C50d76c76fb8947C9A203103d28b55862977","numberOfVotes":6,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x05E70979fd3355133f91FC7C6597A8274169b3bE","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x84044988e0754decAa7444d19c8BF069B977F128","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x3348de5CC020eEfA5D3b8212aEfbC0c19d315f24","numberOfVotes":0,"reason":"Toady here.

Few groups in the ecosystem are more deserving of funding.\n\nWe've spent far more on less certain media outcomes (video production in particular). TNS is already making an impact and acting as a gathering place for Nouns every day.\n\nTo be honest, I feel that TNS is being held to a higher standard because their budget and goals are very granular. A less granular TNS budget for 99 ETH would probably sail through. Art contents, social account management, and general administration budgets feel high, and I would encourage TNS to double down on their core competencies around content production rather than over-optimizing distribution and events. Extending the runway by a few months via this would be excellent. At the same time, I trust the team to manage the funds, and wouldn't make this a precondition for voting for the prop.\n\n+1 to Seneca's reasons. If this prop fails, I would strongly encourage Seneca's suggested changes and resubmit.

More runway also increases the odds of TNS becoming sustainable. Don't hesitate to make hard decisions about where to spend the funds, regardless of the outcome of the prop.

Did the budget actually reduce if we take in ETH volatily? For me it would make a lot more sense to budget in USDC, at the very least the operational side of it.\n\nOverall happy to keep supporting TNS, excited for the new initiatives planned and to see their progress in the next 6 months.

I respect everything you have accomplished. This is not your fault. The open dao dynamics make this type of potential pressure a risk. All we can do is learn and keep going. As you know, I am facing issues with Foodnouns dao..and im sure that is clear to folks…but all we can do is be honest and move forward. I apologize if my comment was insensitive. There have been public and private conversations for over six months about how a few certain individuals main goal was to buy nouns with lils treasury. Purchasing as a way to bolster their voting agendas in the main dao, while holding the largest bags of lils. That may not be something that was able to be controlled but it happened and is still happening. \n\nThis has nothing to do with the concept for lils, the tech or the people. It is merely the reality of the ecosystem currently. \n\nThe honesty around these growing dao issues were swept under the rug for months, including in Nouns. \n\nIt is my job as an early fully on chain nounish sub dao founder to understand what has happened and to avoid the same happening again. \n\nI think lils has a great future…I hold lils…I will continue to support lils…but as the votes show in nouns for this prop…members want lils to find their own answer…to survive and save the dao…\n\nI understand the emotions involved.

Our decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) focuses on gathering, utilizing, managing, and improving idle assets like unused houses and cars within communities worldwide. My fellow co-founder at Enabler DAO, **[yukihamada.eth](https://etherscan.io/address/yukihamada.eth)**, is a holder of **[Noun 312](https://nouns.wtf/noun/312)**, and we believe in the power and potential of NounsDAO just as you do.\n\nWe are proposing a funding of **47,600 USDC** to give a Nounish makeover to a vacation rental property in Tokyo, Japan, valued over $1,000,000 USD. We intend to create “Nouns House #1” with this funding. Our property has already completed interior and exterior renovations; **all of the funding will be used for the Nounish makeover, and development of the mobile app.**\n\nBeyond just providing the property for Nouns House #1, **we will contribute 10% of the profits made from Nouns House #1 to the Nouns House DAO treasury for the first 5 years**. For future Nouns Houses real estates that are funded by the treasury, 100% of the profits will be returned to the treasury.\n\nIn alignment with NounsDAO’s CC0 philosophy, we will make all software and hardware implemented in this project open source. Furthermore, we plan to collaborate with the Nouns projects that are active in Japan such as **[pNouns](https://pnouns.wtf/en/)** (**[Noun 553](https://nouns.wtf/noun/553)**, **[Noun 556](https://nouns.wtf/noun/556)**) for events and promotions.\n\n**The diverse industry experience of our team will significantly contribute to the success of this project.** **[yukihamada.eth](https://etherscan.io/address/yukihamada.eth)** is a former executive CPO at Mercari, **[yukill.eth](https://etherscan.io/address/yukill.eth)** is a former CEO at ZOZO Technologies, **[Jiro](https://twitter.com/jiroisagame)** is a former YouTuber with 1.3 million subscribers, and I, **[tenichiliu.eth](https://etherscan.io/address/tenichiliu.eth)**, am a former engineer from Amazon Seattle.\n\nThis proposal was inspired by **[Nouns Deli](https://twitter.com/NounsDeli)**’s proposal (**[Proposal 254](https://nouns.wtf/vote/254)**, approved on 03/09/2023). Our next step is to establish a Nounish subDAO, called “Nouns House DAO”. Similar to the **[Nouns Builder Protocol](https://nouns.build/)** (**[Proposal 167](https://nouns.wtf/vote/167)**, approved on 11/12/2022), we aim to create a subDAO inheriting NounsDAO’s auction, treasury, and governance system. In the follow-up proposal, we plan to request initial funding for Nouns House DAO treasury, in order to create Nouns House #2 and subsequent Nouns Houses based on community decisions governed by the DAO.\n\n## 1.  Nouns House DAO ⌐◧-◧\n\nNouns House #1 created through this proposal will serve as the first Nouns House governed by Nouns House DAO. Following the successful execution of this proposal, we will submit a follow-up proposal to transfer initial funding to the Nouns House DAO treasury. This initial funding will be substantial enough to secure the purchase of the second Nouns House. The exact amount, along with detailed plans and specific property information, will be disclosed in this follow-up proposal. We believe that having initial funding in the treasury will create strong momentum for this new Nounish DAO.\n\nOur goal is to establish Nouns Houses in major cities globally, allowing individuals to experience Nouns art and culture. Additionally, we aim to **operate this as a profitable venture**, positioning Nouns House DAO as the pioneering Nounish subDAO that introduces a **3rd revenue pillar for the treasury, complementing the NFT auctioning and ETH staking.**\n\nNouns House DAO will oversee the operation and financial management of all Nouns Houses. **As a testament to our commitment, we will contribute 10% of the profits from Nouns House #1 to treasury for the first 5 years.** For all subsequent real estates that are funded by the Nouns House DAO treasury, 100% of the profits will be directed back to the treasury.\n\n![Bedroom](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1W23f_T6aANo9mXh9-lUu3bypKSzU12M4)\n\n## 2. Enabler DAO / Core Team ⌐◧-◧\n\nEnabler DAO is a asset sharing community that aims to facilitate easy sharing of large assets like houses and cars by leveraging blockchain and AI technology. As of November 2023, we operate 10 properties across 5 locations (Tokyo, Kyoto, Atami, Teshikaga, and Honolulu) in Japan and the United States. These properties are monetized through asset sharing within the community as well as through Online Travel Agencies (OTAs) such as Airbnb and Booking.com. Below are some of our properties and links to OTAs.\n\n🇯🇵 [**WHITE HOUSE Atami**](https://airbnb.com/h/white-house-atami\n) - Shizuoka, Japan\n🇯🇵 [**MACHIYA Kyoto**](https://www.kyoto-machiya-inn.com/accommodations/hanatoki/\n) - Kyoto, Japan\n🇯🇵 [**THE NEST Teshikaga**](https://airbnb.com/h/the-nest-teshikaga) - Hokkaido, Japan\n🇺🇸 [**BEACH HOUSE Honolulu**](https://airbnb.com/h/beach-house-honolulu-annex) - Hawaii, USA\n\n![Properties](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1C5UfxmK62s98QryMGZ_SoTIpED1fTUru)\n\nThe 4 founders of Enabler DAO are **[yukihamada.eth](https://etherscan.io/address/yukihamada.eth)** (**[Noun 312](https://nouns.wtf/noun/312)**), former executive CPO of Mercari; **[yukill.eth](https://etherscan.io/address/yukill.eth)**, former CEO at ZOZO Technologies & fund manager for MZ Web3 Fund; **[Jiro](https://twitter.com/jiroisagame)**, former YouTuber “Charisma Brothers” with 1.3 million subscribers & managing partner at iFund; and **[tenichiliu.eth](https://etherscan.io/address/tenichiliu.eth)**, a trilingual former Amazon HQ engineer with 5-years of experience. \n\nEnabler DAO was founded in October 2021, and we currently operate with about 10 DAO members. We have been operating highly successful and profitable vacation rental properties in multiple locations (10~20% annual ROI), and bring expertise in both rental operations and property management. Moreover, our diverse team brings a wide range of business and product development experience, combined with our strong track record, **I believe we are in a unique position to be successful at running the first Nouns House.**\n\n## **3. Nounish Makeover ⌐◧-◧**\n\nWe plan to transform our property in Aoyama, an upscale district in Tokyo, into \"Nouns House #1,\" with a Nounish makeover filled with art and goodies. \n\n![Living Room](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1bwo_xZOKns30glLVRyeoQ7ROKojrQkIE)\n\nAoyama is a hub of designer boutiques, art galleries, cafes, and shopping districts. It's not only a attracts for affluent individuals but also a popular tourist destination. Given the area's reputation and successful track record of our nearby properties, **we anticipate strong demand for high-end vacation rental property in Aoyama.**\n\n![Sauna](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1kabDge7tB6HDlZqn1fYccFdnsMt0-AdX)\n\nIn recent years, there has been a “sauna boom” in Japan. The number of sauna enthusiasts has been increasing due to heightened health consciousness and the proliferation of sauna facilities. In fact, the number of sauna users in Japan has increased by more than one million in the past year, and high-end sauna facilities in Tokyo are extremely popular. **We believe that Nouns House #1 will become widely popular within the sauna communities and beyond.**\n\n![Bath](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=190MOtkZF68sFwLUJzwbxoO4hNEtKDfch)\n\nThe artwork used for interior and exterior of Nouns House #1 will be directed by [amiyoko.eth](https://etherscan.io/address/amiyoko.eth) who have contributed many artwork to various Nouns projects such as NounsDAO Anniversary Art 2023 and Sushi Nouns.\n\n![Exterior](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1bESaiRK3zLewixG-8MvEEq9HgIhnkbqc)\n\nThe 1st floor is the sauna area, the 2nd floor features a living-dining-kitchen area, and the 3rd floor will be an office space and a bedroom. We aim to infuse each floor with Nounish elements while maintaining a sense of luxury in the interior design.\n\n![Chill](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1CvxZml-3RPmPaHxNUzN7yUE2DKu-wLyU)\n\n## 4. Marketing Efforts **⌐◧-◧**\n\nTo amplify the presence of Nouns House #1, **we will be forming a strategic partnership with a popular Japanese YouTuber group, [EvisJap](https://youtube.com/@EvisJap?si=6Oi6Ll6fIzis70ib).** With a subscriber base of 630,000, primarily young adults, they are known for their energetic travel blogs and lively social gatherings that resonate with the adventurous spirit of youth.\n\nDuring the weekdays, EvisJap will be utilizing Nouns House #1 as their recording studio, bringing a creative buzz to the space while providing regular exposure of Nouns to a broad audience through their videos. On weekends, Nouns House #1 will transform into an luxury private sauna. This dual-use approach optimizes the utility of the property, and exemplifies the innovative and adaptive spirit of the Nouns.\n\nThis collaboration, born from our unique relationship with EbisJap, is a synergy that offers exposure to Nouns House without direct marketing efforts. The value of this organic promotion is an example of the unique contribution that our team brings to the Nouns community.\n\n## **5. Mobile App ⌐◧-◧**\n\n**We will develop a mobile app for facilitating reservations and assigning maintenance work for Nouns House DAO**. This app will be powered by open-source framework called **[Skeet](https://skeet.dev/en/)** which seamlessly integrates with Google Cloud Platform and Firebase, making it easier to develop serverless full-stack applications. \n\nIt's worth noting that both Enabler and **[El Soul Labo](https://labo.elsoul.nl/en/)**, the team behind Skeet, received equity funding from **[East Ventures](https://east.vc/)**, one of the biggest venture capital fund in Asia. With the cutting edge Skeet framework and the invaluable support from the creator of Skeet, we can efficiently develop this app with just one engineer on our end.\n\nThe app will integrate with existing tools that offers API such as **[Beds24](https://beds24.com/)** for inventory management, **[Sesame Smart Lock](https://jp.candyhouse.co/)** for automatically issuing one-time guest keys, and **[Stripe](https://stripe.com/en-jp)** for fiat payment processing. In the interim, before our app release, we'll use **[LINE](https://line.me/en/)** and **[LINE Marketplace](https://line-marketplace.com/jp/app)** apps for chat-based reservation.\n\nFurthermore, we will incorporate web3 capabilities such as token-gating and cryptocurrency payment into the app. We plan to offer special coupons and priority reservations to Nouns House NFT holders, and allow payments in major cryptocurrencies.\n\n## **6. Utility Token ⌐◧-◧**\n\nWe plan to introduce a utility token which will be used for accessing Nouns House and can be earned through completing maintenance gigs listed in the app. **We envision some members of the Nouns House DAO to work maintenance gigs in order to earn the utility token.** We plan to use Solana chain for the token for 3 reasons: near-zero gas fees, rapid execution, and its integration with the user-friendly multi-chain wallet called Phantom. Enabler DAO has already been experimenting with Solana based utility token called [**EBR**](https://solscan.io/token/E1JxwaWRd8nw8vDdWMdqwdbXGBshqDcnTcinHzNMqg2Y) (available on [**Orca DEX**](https://v1.orca.so/liquidity/browse?tokenMint=E1JxwaWRd8nw8vDdWMdqwdbXGBshqDcnTcinHzNMqg2Y)) and have experience in this realm.\n\n## **7. Roadmap ⌐◧-◧**\n\nWe will begin the Nounish makeover and the development of mobile app, immediately following the approval of this proposal. In January 2024, we plan to pre-open Nouns House #1, followed by grand opening in February. Beta version of mobile app will be released in March, followed by production release in April. We will submit submit a follow-up proposal by Feburary 2024 to transfer initial funding for the DAO treasury followed by successful execution of this proposal.\n\n![Roadmap](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1xkl6xzFYEi-rAtpjmnARWpc34Pj_Dlh4)\n\n## **8. Budget ⌐◧-◧**\n\nWe are proposing **47,600 USDC funding for creating Nouns House #1 and to kick start the software infrastructure development for Nouns House DAO.** The Nounish makeover will cost $17,000, and the development of the mobile app will cost $30,600. All work will commence immediately upon the approval of the proposal.\n\n**Nouns House #1 Nounish Makeover: $17,000**\n- \"Nounish\" Exterior Wall Art: $6,000\n- \"Nounish\" Interior Art: $8,000\n- \"Nounish\" Goodies: $3,000\n\n**Mobile App (6-month development): $30,600**\n- Founding Engineer: $5,000/month\n- [Skeet](https://skeet.dev/en/) (Enterprise Support): $100/month\n\n## **9. Community Benefits ⌐◧-◧**\n\nThis proposal aims to **expand the Nouns community by creating the first \"Nouns House\", a network of properties where people can experience Nouns art and culture in major cities worldwide.**\n\nIn the next step, we will propose to transfer initial funding for Nouns House DAO treasury. This new Nounish subDAO will own Real World Asset (RWA) and operate them as a profit-making business. RWA is an area where the web3 industry is still struggling, and this new venture has the potential to significantly advance the industry on this front.\n\nNouns House NFT holders will be offered special perks such as discounted rates and priority access to Nouns Houses via token gating. Additionally, upon the funding of the Nouns House DAO treasury in our next proposal, **existing Nouns NFT holders can apply for Nouns House NFT airdrop by a pre-determined date**. This airdrop is optional and provides an opportunity for existing NounsDAO members to participate in the governance for Nouns House DAO without having to bid in the auction.\n\n## **10. CC0 ⌐◧-◧**\n\nWe believe, Nouns House’s CC0 culture will bring innovation to the real estate industry. While real estate design and architecture are generally not open-source, we will make all of these publicly available through our CC0 library. CC0 approach will also have a large impact on the vacation rental industry. **By providing tools to help achieve efficient operations, we will accelerate the automation and digital transformation of the vacation rental industry.** The interest and attention that this CC0 model will generate within these industries will serve as the ideal platform for spreading the culture and values of Nouns.\n\n## **11. Risks & Considerations ⌐◧-◧**\n\nWe are enthusiastic members of the Nouns community and, as Noun owner, strongly resonate with the vision of Nouns. **We believe that the Nouns model holds innovative power in asset management and vacation rental fields.** This decentralized, community-led governance model has the potential to offer new approaches in asset sharing and feels like the ideal way to manage assets in a decentralized manner. On the other hand, there are some risks considered in achieving the vision of this project:\n\n1. **Regulatory Risk**: Operating within a decentralized framework could potentially make the project subject to regulations. Compliance with local laws is crucial.\n2. **Technical Risk**: The integration of blockchain technology with physical assets like real estate presents several challenges. The implementation of smart contracts to manage the property must be executed flawlessly.\n3. **Community Engagement**: The strength of a DAO lies in its community. For long-term success, it's important to maintain community engagement and participation in governance.\n\nBy acknowledging these risks and proactively addressing them, we aim for the success of the Nouns House project.","proposer":"0xCA06BdB8b1f677a1C29cbCf9dF69aE76cCEA0E4C","startBlock":18562010,"endBlock":18590810,"executed":false},"votes":[{"support":1,"voter":"0x8d2B28265bEE1C926433A25D951adb03De9Ab275","numberOfVotes":2,"reason":"We,pNouns support this proposal.This vision is to create a Nounish DAO that is financially sustainable and scalable in the realm of property rental.

These three founders were very early builders in the Nouns ecosystem, without them the most active nounish communities today would not exist. Not only were they behind the earliest iterations of the Nouns auction and DAO structure, they have continued to contribute to the ecosystem as time has gone on.\n\nAs devoted builders in the nouniverse, they have proven their value and alignment with the DAO and would be ideal candidates to receive Nouns. \n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SyYinN_M6.png)\n[*Source (h/t MikeGood, Lil Nouner)*](https://twitter.com/GoodBeats/status/1706019634246213811)\n\nThese communities **far** exceed the size of the community of Nouners.

The intentions back then was to: \n* Make it easier for long-time nouners to fork if they felt fundamentally misaligned with the direction Nouns was accelerating towards in season 3 (post-fork 0).\n* Reduce the daily treasury leak to arbitrageurs by making arb easier (and thus more competitive) while figuring out thoughtful acceleration of spend to lower BV naturally.\n\nNow, a month and a half later, we've mostly cleared those intentions:\n* [Fork 1](https://nouns.wtf/fork/1) occurred and long-time nouners that felt fundamentally misaligned (such as poap and beautifulnfts) joined the fork. We're not seeing additional forks being initiated by long-time nouners.\n* Book value has been lowered from the mid-30 ETH range to mid-20 ETH range through important bets on [Gnars ($300k)](https://www.nouns.camp/proposals/382), [Nouns Stories + Stoopid Buddy ($1.8M)](https://www.nouns.camp/proposals/397), [Protocol Guild Animation Film ($400k)](https://www.nouns.camp/proposals/407), [Nounish ($1M)](https://www.nouns.camp/proposals/413), [Messhup's Graphic Novel ($100k)](https://www.nouns.camp/proposals/423), [Rise of Blus ($1.1M)](https://www.nouns.camp/proposals/425), and likely [The Nouns Square ($270k)](https://www.nouns.camp/proposals/434). Happy with these high conviction bets.\n\nNow that we don't really need to worry about (for the time being) fundamentally misaligned long-time nouners being stuck in the DAO, we're in a position of mostly just dealing with arbitrageurs.\n\nI wouldn't be a proponent of raising the fork threshold if that meant arbitraguers would just accumulate more Nouns for longer, but given that the BV is now already lower, [arb modelling by the Verbs team](https://mirror.xyz/verbsteam.eth/W4gaOrp6NC6jopc6vGsGuhz3o4ej0G_0TFhBlcLed94) is showing that if we raise the fork threshold to 30% the expected BV at next fork would be in the low-10 ETH range, which means that if the true market clearing price is above that then we should start seeing real buyers outbid the arbitrageurs immediately.\n\nWe could just wait out a few more months for BV to naturally lower and the problem to resolve itself, but the benefits of adding new DAO members and getting true price discovery sooner in my opinion outweighs the governance overhead of adjusting the fork threshold and thus I propose we raise the fork threshold to 30% now.","proposer":"0xaE65E700f3f8904ac1007d47a5309dD26f8146c0","startBlock":18586084,"endBlock":18614884,"executed":true},"votes":[{"support":1,"voter":"0x8ac3ecf6973E020cC0E6e8989Fb71B4a77D65987","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":"Tbh I don't see the move to 10% as successful, felt like it just made it easier to arb the treasury, even if with a lower margin.

Lowering the threshold increases arber competition, accelerating the process, decreasing their profits, and allowing them to drain less of the treasury.\n**Doesn't inviting arbitrageurs disrupt governance?**\nA lower threshold doesn't change that arbers will vote No on proposals and attempt to block spending. Conversely, it makes it less likely that arbers grow into a big cohort with significant voting power, which is a side effect of accumulating to reach the fork threshold.\n**Why not raise the threshold instead?**\nWhile raising the threshold might seem like a good stopgap to defend the dao against further arbitrage, it comes with an air of intellectual dishonesty and risks being regressive, while not accomplishing that much in terms of protection."},{"support":1,"voter":"0x47C0224f6c298C4B03f2fbbB986815859a0Abd20","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":"🥌 🥌 x FOR\n↳ benbodhi.eth\n↳ ourrevolution.eth\n\n🥌 x ABSTAIN\n↳ 0x32d1...d4f5\n\nThrowing weight behind zero weight votes with reason."}]},{"prop":{"id":440,"description":"# One Noun, Every Day, Forever... in an Action Rogue-Lite Game!

We will also explore the game mechanics and creative direction with the Nouns community to discover product-market fit.\n\nPlay our pre-production demo [here](https://thepixelshop.itch.io/nounstown-demo)!\n\n# A Vertical Slice of One Noun, Every Day\n\n![stage_nouns_v_souls.png](https://i.imgur.com/hK0MOWs.png)\n\n**The One Noun, Every Day game mode will be the hook and anchor behind this game.  We want to re-imagine the continuity and diversity of Nouns through the lens of a dynamic and captivating game for the masses**.  \n\nJust as each blockchain hash determines the traits for each noun, every day, we will use a game seed to generate new elements for a each game, every day.  These changing elements include Nouns equipped with fun and diverse items, a generative world map populated with vibrant environments, random upgrades available to select from, and enemy minions and bosses you must battle to win.  Every player will have a 24 hour rolling period to defeat each version of the game.  This innovative mechanic has the potential to fuel a social and competitive gaming culture due to the following reasons:\n\n- Replayability - Optimize gameplay strategies through trial and error as you explore new characters and maps\n- Progression - Unlock new content and playable characters to use in the “Classic Mode” by defeating the game and a robust achievement system\n- Competition - Compete against all other players for the fastest clear time, and more importantly, bragging rights!\n- Game Metas - Discover unpredictable metas in a dynamic Nounish world\n\n## **Funding Details and Deliverables**\n\n**We are asking for $75,000 to develop a polished and playable vertical slice of the One Noun, Every Day game loop to demonstrate our intended player experience.** \n\nThis funding request provides for a $65,000 production budget (approximately 1,500 hours) and a $10,000 marketing budget, over an approximately 3-month period.  Key features required to produce this vertical slice include player character design, items and upgrades, environment design, sound design, UI/UX, and a single boss encounter.  Each feature will go through design and documentation, art and animation, programming and development, sound design, and testing and quality assurance, as applicable.  The deliverables and estimated allocation are as follows:\n\n- 1 Boss Encounter - 20 percent or 300 hours\n- Generative Map and Environment Assets - 20 percent or 300 hours\n- 7 Items and 7 Upgrades - 15 percent or 225 hours\n- 7 Rotating Nouns Characters - 15 percent or 225 hours\n- Sound design for completed features - 10 percent or 150 hours\n- Functional UI/UX for Menus and Gameplay - 10 percent or 150 hours\n- Comprehensive Game Design Document - 10 percent or 150 hours\n\nWe have allocated a marketing budget of $10,000 to produce the following deliverables:\n\n- Branding and Marketing Assets\n- Establish Social Media presence and Steam Page\n- Professional Teaser Trailer\n\n# Creative Direction\n\n## Nouns\n\nOur game embraces a clash of two starkly contrasting worlds. On one side, the Nounish personality will be at the core of the player character, the items and upgrades you acquire during each run, and NPCs you discover over time.  These elements will be designed to permeate Nounish personality through vibrant colors, joyful energy, and whimsical ideas. \n\n### Items\n\nWe are exploring ideas that are “outside of the box” and consistent with the outlandish and diversely strange Nouns world.  \n\n### Upgrades\n\nAs the player clears each room,  they are rewarded a pair of Noggles that unlocks a powerful new upgrade to use during the run.  Players will experiment with different combinations of upgrades to create fun synergies and provide a unique gameplay experience each run.  Each upgrade is inspired by various characters from the Nouns collection.  \n\n## Forgotten Souls\n\nAnd on the other side, you'll uncover the corrupt Forgotten Souls that have crossed into the Nouniverse upon discovering the power of Noggles.  The Souls are holding Nouns captive in their inanimate forms and using the power from the stolen Noggles to convert the Nouniverse into their own shadowy realm.  The Souls will serve as the enemy minions, bosses, and antagonist of our game, designed with contrasting dark personalities and colors.  \n\n### Minions\n\nAll minions will be designed to showcase their haunting personalities through fantastical and diverse character design, animations, and attack styles.  The contrasting nature of the minions will provide for an aesthetic design that emphasizes readability and a visual feeling of cleansing the corruption from Nouns Town as the player progresses.  \n\n![Minions](https://i.imgur.com/aZx9FC4.png)\n\n### Bosses\n\nOur boss encounters thrive to be one of the more memorable experiences that you will encounter in our game.  Our bosses will be inspired by rare Forgotten Souls characters but have our own stylistic flare.  These boss encounters will be visually stunning and paired with cohesive game play mechanics that immerse and challenge the player.  \n\n## Environment\n\nThe collision of these two distinct moods creates a captivating experience.  Each run will begin as a corrupt Nouniverse that has taken over by the Souls.  As the player progresses through the map, the corruption is pushed back and the vibrant Nounish world is slowly restored!  \n\nWe’ll design Nounish locations with their own distinct aesthetics and corresponding play styles.  Each location on the map will go through a similar design process and produce the following deliverables:\n\n- Concept Design - Establish the location’s identity with clearly defined characteristics\n- Map Assets - Represent each location by a low resolution design on the map\n- Tile Sets -  Outfit the walls, floors, and objects within the rooms of each location.  The following tile set was used in our demo and will receive a Nounish update:\n    ![Demo Tileset](https://i.imgur.com/Bc2Ms0C.png)\n- Decorations and Objects - Fill each room with decorations for personality and destructible objects for an interactive setting\n\n## Creative Commons\n\nAll of the art and animations that we produce will be open-source and available for anyone to use!\n\n# Future Vision\n\n**The goal of this proposal is to “follow the fun” through addicting game play and Nounish creative expressions.  However, we have a long term vision to produce and distribute a fully fleshed out Nouns indie game.**\n\n### Additional Classic Mode\n\nOur core game loop will be the One Noun, Every Day game mode.  However, as the player character and map remain constant in this game mode, we also plan to release a Classic Mode to serve as a more traditional rogue-lite focused on randomness and meta progression, or progression that exists outside of regular gameplay.  In this mode, no two runs will be the same as a fresh new map is generated with each play through.  \n\nBut there’s also significant depth beyond the randomness.  This mode will be accompanied with a robust achievement system that challenges the player to unlock exciting new items, upgrades, and cosmetics.  \n\n### Organic Growth\n\nDuring development, we’ll maintain a steady pipeline of project updates, promotional content, and social engagement to generate organic growth.  Additionally, we plan to attend major game development conventions such as GDC, PAX, and Gamescon to engage with our community in person.  \n\n### Game Distribution\n\nWe will use Steam as our primary distribution platform to release the game.  Steam provides access to the largest PC gaming community, as well as extensive marketing and analytics features.  We will explore porting the game to Nintendo Switch post-release to reach a wider audience.\n\n## Collaboration\n\n### Nouns Community\n\nWe are committed to an open and inclusive collaboration process throughout production.  We will regularly engage with select community members to explore creative discussions, validate game design concepts, and explore marketing opportunities.  Our goal is to create an immersive game that represents the Nounish identity and resonates with both the community and the player.  \n\n### Forgotten Runes Wizard’s Cult\n\nThe game will be in collaboration with our friends from the Forgotten Runes Wizard’s Cult.  Their team is well-respected and produce engaging and high-quality products and experiences.  This collaboration brings promotional support from both their community and team’s established network within the gaming, content creation, and entertainment industries.  This partnership presents an opportunity to elevate our game, expand its reach, and enhance the prospect for breakout success.\n\n### Nouns Esports\n\nWe will collaborate with Nouns Esports to generate excitement and promotional content with the game launch.  This partnership will explore ideas to engage the Nouns gaming community primarily through streaming, competitions, and giveaways.  \n\n# Why a Nounish indie game?\n\nA rogue-lite indie game provides a compelling opportunity for Nouns to enter the gaming sector:\n\n### Creative Expression\n\nIndie games provide for a perfect landscape to build a Nounish world complete with innovative game mechanics that are complimented with vibrant aesthetics and visual representation.  We aim to populate our world with original Nouns characters, an outlandish environment, and charming storytelling to engage players and cultivate a connection to Nouns culture.    \n\n### Strategic Advantages\n\nOur small indie team provides several advantages including streamlined communication, transparency, adaptability, and a strong team synergy.  Yet, while being a small team, we have access to powerful platforms such as Godot for development, Steam for distribution, and social media and Discord for our community.  Our game is thoughtfully designed to pack a punch with addictive gameplay mechanics, engaging progression and replayability, and long-term scalability and new content.  We’re able to accomplish all of this within a reasonable scope and production budget, and without sacrificing on the game’s entertainment or aesthetics.\n\n## Genre\n\nOur genre of choice may be a mouthful (Non Linear Action Rogue-Lite Bullet Hell…) but it’s a great platform for a Nouns game.  The generative rogue features share a strong parallel with the Nounish identity; bullet hells offer replayability.  We have described the key features of each sub-genres and the games that inspire us below:\n\n### Rogue-Lite\n\nThe key feature of a Rogue-Lite genre is a game loop that results in permadeath.  Each time a player begins their attempt or run, they will either defeat the final boss or die trying.  A Rogue-Lite game generally involves some meta progression that takes place outside of the run; usually in the form of upgraded items, statistics, abilities, or skill trees.\n\n### Bullet Hell\n\nBullet Hell combat mechanics emphasize complex bullet patterns for the player to navigate and dodge.  Our bullet hell game will be designed as a twin stick shooter where the player is on a flat plane with a top-down perspective.  \n\n### Non-Linear Progression\n\nOne of the unique selling points of our Rogue-Lite game is that it will have Non-Linear progression.  The two main features to highlight in this design include a unique map that is generated each run and the freedom for the player to decide their order of progression.   \n\n### Inspiration\n[Enter the Gungeon](https://store.steampowered.com/app/311690/Enter_the_Gungeon/), [Hades](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1145360/Hades/), [Risk of Rain 2](https://store.steampowered.com/app/632360/Risk_of_Rain_2/), [Nuclear Throne](https://store.steampowered.com/app/242680/Nuclear_Throne/), [Vampire Survivors](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1794680/Vampire_Survivors/)\n\n# Why The Pixel Shop?\n\n![The Pixel Shop](https://i.imgur.com/57yu7tx.png)\n\n[The Pixel Shop](https://thepixelshop.app) is an independent Art and Game Development studio founded in March 2022. We are a team of four talented artists and developers with over 30 years of art and game development experience, collectively.  Our team has experience producing artwork with major indie game studios; developing game engines, commercial software, and game mods; and managing large scope projects through completion. \n\nAs a team, we recently led the creative and art direction for Battle for Goblin Town, an upcoming on-chain “Settlers of Catan” style game developed by [Forgotten Runes Wizard’s Cult](https://www.forgottenrunes.com/).  During this project, we designed and produced all of the art assets, UI/UX, [gameplay trailer](https://x.com/GoblinTown_Game/status/1708859222623232363?s=20). \n\n![Goblin Town Promo](https://i.imgur.com/hGejLix.png)\n\nWe also just completed our latest Moonbirds project which demonstrates our creative and technical capabilities, and shares many parallels with this Nouns proposal.  For this project, we animated all 10,000 Moonbirds as pixel sprites and introduced a mini-game as a proof-of-work to showcase how these sprites can be used in indie-game development.

We will also explore the game mechanics and creative direction with the Nouns community to discover product-market fit.\n\nChanges from [Prop 414 (Version 1)](https://nouns.wtf/vote/414):\n- Focused attention on our One Noun, Every Day core mechanic and game play \n- Expanded on creative direction and process to capture the Nounish personality\n- Provided a detailed scope for the vertical slice deliverables\n- Added long term vision for collaboration with the Nouns community, and strategy partnerships with Nouns Esports and Forgotten Runes Wizard's Cult\n\n**Play our pre-production Demo [HERE](https://thepixelshop.itch.io/nounstown-demo)!**\n\n# A Vertical Slice of One Noun, Every Day\n\n![stage_nouns_v_souls.png](https://i.imgur.com/pBTUbZl.png)\n\n**The One Noun, Every Day game mode will be the hook and anchor behind this game.  We want to re-imagine the continuity and diversity of Nouns through the lens of a dynamic and captivating game for the masses**.  \n\nJust as each blockchain hash determines the traits for each noun, every day, we will use a game seed to generate new elements for a each game, every day.  These changing elements include Nouns equipped with fun and diverse items, a generative world map populated with vibrant environments, random upgrades available to select from, and enemy minions and bosses you must battle to win.  Every player will have a 24 hour rolling period to defeat each version of the game.  This innovative mechanic has the potential to fuel a social and competitive gaming culture due to the following reasons:\n\n- Replayability - Optimize gameplay strategies through trial and error as you explore new characters and maps\n- Progression - Unlock new content and playable characters to use in the “Classic Mode” by defeating the game and a robust achievement system\n- Competition - Compete against all other players for the fastest clear time, and more importantly, bragging rights!\n- Game Metas - Discover unpredictable metas in a dynamic Nounish world\n\n## **Funding Details and Deliverables**\n\n**We are asking for $75,000 to develop a polished and playable vertical slice of the One Noun, Every Day game loop to demonstrate our intended player experience.** \n\nThis funding request provides for a $65,000 production budget (approximately 1,500 hours) and a $10,000 marketing budget, over an approximately 3-month period.  Key features required to produce this vertical slice include player character design, items and upgrades, environment design, sound design, UI/UX, and a single boss encounter.  Each feature will go through design and documentation, art and animation, programming and development, sound design, and testing and quality assurance, as applicable.  The deliverables and estimated allocation are as follows:\n\n- 1 Boss Encounter - 20 percent or 300 hours\n- Generative Map and Environment Assets - 20 percent or 300 hours\n- 7 Items and 7 Upgrades - 15 percent or 225 hours\n- 7 Rotating Nouns Characters - 15 percent or 225 hours\n- Sound design for completed features - 10 percent or 150 hours\n- Functional UI/UX for Menus and Gameplay - 10 percent or 150 hours\n- Comprehensive Game Design Document - 10 percent or 150 hours\n\nWe have allocated a marketing budget of $10,000 to produce the following deliverables:\n\n- Branding and Marketing Assets\n- Establish Social Media presence and Steam Page\n- Professional Teaser Trailer\n\n# Creative Direction\n![Comic Strip](https://i.imgur.com/Aw5LE39.png)\n## Nouns\n\nOur game embraces a clash of two starkly contrasting worlds. On one side, the Nounish personality will be at the core of the player character, the items and upgrades you acquire during each run, and NPCs you discover over time.  These elements will be designed to permeate Nounish personality through vibrant colors, joyful energy, and whimsical ideas. \n\n### Items\n\nWe are exploring ideas that are “outside of the box” and consistent with the outlandish and diversely strange Nouns world.  These items will be packed with personality but also provide distinct play styles.  Early concepts we have explored include the Gnome Chuckaz, Sliced Bread Shurikens, and Pinata Blitzers:\n![item concepts](https://i.imgur.com/i2ciy7e.png)\n*Concept design for potential items*\n### Upgrades\n\nAs the player clears each room,  they are rewarded a pair of Noggles that unlocks a powerful new upgrade to use during the run.  Players will experiment with different combinations of upgrades to create fun synergies and provide a unique gameplay experience each run.  Each upgrade is inspired by various characters from the Nouns collection. \n![upgrade concepts](https://i.imgur.com/rUVjlxX.png) \n\n\n## Forgotten Souls\n\nAnd on the other side, you'll uncover the corrupt Forgotten Souls that have crossed into the Nouniverse upon discovering the power of Noggles.  The Souls are holding Nouns captive in their inanimate forms and using the power from the stolen Noggles to convert the Nouniverse into their own shadowy realm.  The Souls will serve as the enemy minions, bosses, and antagonist of our game, designed with contrasting dark personalities and colors.  \n\n### Minions\n\nAll minions will be designed to showcase their haunting personalities through fantastical and diverse character design, animations, and attack styles.  The contrasting nature of the minions will provide for an aesthetic design that emphasizes readability and a visual feeling of cleansing the corruption from Nouns Town as the player progresses.  \n![Minions](https://i.imgur.com/aZx9FC4.png)\n\n\n### Bosses\n\nOur boss encounters thrive to be one of the more memorable experiences that you will encounter in our game.  Our bosses will be inspired by rare Forgotten Souls characters but have our own stylistic flare.  These boss encounters will be visually stunning and paired with cohesive game play mechanics that immerse and challenge the player.  \n\n## Environment\n\nThe collision of these two distinct moods creates a captivating experience.  Each run will begin as a corrupt Nouniverse that has taken over by the Souls.  As the player progresses through the map, the corruption is pushed back and the vibrant Nounish world is slowly restored!  \n\n![World Concept](https://i.imgur.com/qC0bTvv.png)\n*Concept design for an environment that we will design a tile set for*\n\nWe’ll design Nounish locations with their own distinct and colorful themes, from quaint towns and snowy wonderlands, to barren deserts and tropical beaches.  Each playable location will go through a similar design process and produce the following deliverables:\n\n- Concept Design - Establish the location’s identity with clearly defined characteristics\n- Map Assets - Represent each location by a low resolution design in the Overworld Map\n- Tile Sets -  Outfit the walls, floors, and objects within the rooms of each location.  \n- Decorations and Objects - Fill each room with decorations for personality and destructible objects for an interactive setting\n    ![Demo Tileset](https://i.imgur.com/Bc2Ms0C.png)\n*Concept tile set used in demo that will receive a Nounish update*\n## Creative Commons\n\nAll of the art and animations that we produce will be open-source and available for anyone to use!\n\n# Future Vision\n\n**The goal of this proposal is to “follow the fun” through addicting game play and Nounish creative expressions.  However, we have a long term vision to produce and distribute a fully fleshed out Nouns indie game.**\n\n### Additional Classic Mode\n\nOur core game loop will be the One Noun, Every Day game mode.  However, as the player character and map remain constant in this game mode, we also plan to release a Classic Mode to serve as a more traditional rogue-lite focused on randomness and meta progression, or progression that exists outside of regular gameplay.  In this mode, no two runs will be the same as a fresh new map is generated with each play through.  \n\nBut there’s also significant depth beyond the randomness.  This mode will be accompanied with a robust achievement system that challenges the player to unlock exciting new items, upgrades, and cosmetics.  \n\n### Organic Growth\n\nDuring development, we’ll maintain a steady pipeline of project updates, promotional content, and social engagement to generate organic growth.

In my mind this adds a \"skilling\" element to the game of Nouns and could encourage people to build with their Noun.

Technically, this change involves refunding tx.origin instead of msg.sender.\n\nExact changes can be seen in [this pull request](https://github.com/nounsDAO/nouns-monorepo/pull/813).\n\nBecause this change is very minor, we're not going through an official audit process. This change has been reviewed by solimander.\n\n## Why this happened\n\nWe started work on V3 before the V2.1 fix, and V3 is in different files so syncing the master branch into the V3 branch did not apply the fix to V3 code.\n\nHere’s a short sequence of events:\n\n1. September 22, 2022 [v3 branch]: the branch that later becomes DAO V3 is created with initial code experiments.\n2. October 25, 2022 [dao 2.1 branch]: refund bug fixed.\n3. November 2, 2022 [v3 branch]: we sync from master and create a new DAO V3 file.\n4. November 9, 2022 [master] refund fix merged into master, to be deployed.\n5. January 4, 2023 [v3 branch] we sync from master, the refund fix is updated in the DAO V2 file, but we are focused on V3 and do not examine the merge carefully and miss the opportunity to copy the fix into V3.\n6. January 11, 2023 [v3 branch] we split DAO V3 into library files to overcome the contract size limit; this change makes the bug harder to discover, as we lose the ability to directly compare V3 to V2 line for line, as we still could have done between V2 and V1.\n\nAnother problem was that we did not copy or change all V1/V2 tests to test V3; most of the tests were copied to run on V3 as well, but we dropped the ball on the gas refund test.\n\n## How we’re preventing it from happening again\n\n1. Make sure tests are always running against the latest version.\n2. When merging a fix to master, make sure to correctly merge it into any open branch.\n\nRunning all tests on the latest version is the most important takeaway. As part of working on this fix we made sure all DAO tests are now running on the latest version, and removed old duplicate tests that were testing older versions. We believe we’ve reduced the chances of this happening again significantly.\n\nThe second point is helpful as an extra layer of safety, mostly helpful if we don’t have sufficient tests or failed to run all tests against the latest version we’re working on. We will certainly be more mindful in future merges.\n\n## Transaction\n\nThe transaction sets the DAO proxy implementation to be the fixed version deployed at [0xe3caa436461DBa00CFBE1749148C9fa7FA1F5344](https://etherscan.io/address/0xe3caa436461dba00cfbe1749148c9fa7fa1f5344).\n\nThanks,\n\nthe verbs ⌐◨-◨","proposer":"0x537e458B75A28F3B6529457d50a2047F28594947","startBlock":18636417,"endBlock":18665217,"executed":true},"votes":[{"support":1,"voter":"0x10deC36B4AC9d3b60490dFE2799881287d4a74cc","numberOfVotes":2,"reason":"card4rena"},{"support":1,"voter":"0xA86882277E69FbF0a51805cdc8b0a3a113079E63","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x7f64C6e6908DE72221A06A06b4a02A6546a4d6d2","numberOfVotes":2,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x2ED22eA03fEA3e5BD90f6Fdd52C20c26ff6e1300","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x008c84421dA5527F462886cEc43D2717B686A7e4","numberOfVotes":8,"reason":"Verbs are Nounish, ty guys"},{"support":1,"voter":"0xb0dd496FffFa300df1EFf42702066aCa81834404","numberOfVotes":3,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x8E37D5fD47016Fe5c671C7c1b980afbe6773595C","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x35f2A10B73aA0B5d8Dc6639C51Af7D5dDcD1846a","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0xa903C06BF35286f6d1cDAD25396748353979a44C","numberOfVotes":0,"reason":"Thank you 🙏"},{"support":1,"voter":"0x66cd193d0C0Fb3B9b44Dd371107617A7e9f38184","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x91dCCAA260CC4616E1a6e6b693DB7207C5E42937","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":"nounimander"},{"support":1,"voter":"0x849151d7D0bF1F34b70d5caD5149D28CC2308bf1","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":"fix it"},{"support":1,"voter":"0x2666f0C8FB58d182f2Dd79475DCA4A07B3724607","numberOfVotes":3,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x3B60e31CFC48a9074CD5bEbb26C9EAa77650a43F","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x387a161C6b25aA854100aBaED39274e51aaffffd","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x48466Bc93dF6563c2A638A4be20Feca46A1E314e","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x1db19B9903c5510AA5a866ea643Eb021CD12Bda0","numberOfVotes":2,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0xE3f27DEFf96fe178e87559F36Cbf868B9E75967D","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":"incremental patches good"},{"support":1,"voter":"0xcC2688350d29623E2A0844Cc8885F9050F0f6Ed5","numberOfVotes":8,"reason":"**FOR - 34 VOTES**\n\n**benbodhi** | *\"Verbs - the doing words.

We contend that despite the existence of various sub-DAOs, none of them are exclusively dedicated to cultivating the connections and inspiration vital for artists to actively and substantially engage in the Nouns ecosystem. Few subcommunity initiatives manage to captivate the interest of potential new members. The insights from esteemed artists, whom we deeply respect, have contributed to the prominence of several communities and projects. We aim to bring this prominence to Nouns while emphasizing the priority of advancing digital art.\n\n## Overview\n\nDigital art currently finds itself diminished in the broader artistic discourse, prompting our dedication to effecting change in this scenario. We aspire to propel digital art to a pervasive state. The establishment of the Mesmer: A Nouns Council for the Digital Arts emerges as a strategic initiative designed to cultivate widespread appreciation for digital art, fostering education and adoption on a global scale as we support the artists behind it.\n\n*“We're fortunate to have an exceptional team, and together within Nouns Community we're poised to create a lasting legacy in the history of digital art.”*\n\n## Team\n\n*The concept behind the concept*\n\n\"So I said 'What if we created something very provocative? A sanctuary for artists, but in its broadest interpretation, also a work of art, a creation, and a catalyst for meaningful discourse.\nWhat degree of intrigue generated by anonymity can truly be leveraged as a potent tool? What is the equilibrium of anonymity? Satoshi Nakamoto's execution in this regard was remarkable.\"\n\n**Note:** The project's creators have chosen to maintain their anonymity, prioritizing a focus on the project's message and artistic vision rather than individual recognition.\n\n**Advisors Description;**\nLeaders of the art community, tastemakers, builders, advisors, critics, curators, community supporters and industry art partners.\n\n• [Noah](https://x.com/cryptopunknoah)\nPrev Brand Lead [CryptoPunks](https://x.com/cryptopunksnfts) and Contemporary Art Specialist [Christie’s](https://twitter.com/christiesinc) & Founder and Artist [Howlerz](https://x.com/howlerznft)\n\n• [Alejandro Cartagena](https://twitter.com/halecar2)\nCo-founder and Artist of [Fellowship](https://x.com/fellowshiptrust) & [Obscura](https://x.com/obscuradao). Works in the SFMoMA, JPMorgan, MFAH, MoCP, National Gallery, and the Getty Museum collections.\n\n• [Sebastian Sanchez](https://twitter.com/sebastianss527)\nManager of Digital Art at [Christie’s](https://twitter.com/christiesinc)\n\n**Community Manager Description;**\n\n• [Multi](https://x.com/multivrsstudios)\nCommunity Moderator at [Beeple](https://twitter.com/beeple) & [XCOPY](https://twitter.com/XCOPYART).

Patrick initially started as a traditional painter and transitioned to digital art around 2012. He gained recognition for manipulating image files of paintings and photographs, creating captivating animated loops. Patrick is an incredibly influential and powerful voice in the art world.\n\n**Curators Description;**\n\n• [Micol](https://x.com/micolmicolmicol)\nFounder of [Verticalcrypto](https://x.com/verticalcrypto)\n\n• [Sofia Garcia](https://x.com/sofiagarcia_io)\nFounder [ARTXCODE](https://x.com/artxcode_io) & [Board Code](https://x.com/codeartorg)/[Art and Art Blocks](https://x.com/artblocks_io)\n\n## Movement\n\nAt the heart of this movement is art, a robust network that isn't assessed by the sheer quantity of connections but by the depth and quality of those connections. It places a premium on authenticity over superficiality, sincerity over pretense, and genuine engagement over mere presence.\n\nSolid networking within the artistic community recognizes the power of reciprocity, where giving and contributing to your network leads to receiving in return. It nurtures a sense of community where individuals support each other's aspirations, exchange ideas, and create opportunities. This movement is grounded in that when one artist prospers, the entire network reaps the benefits.\n\nThe Mesmer extends its influence across various domains. In the realm of knowledge, it fuels innovation and sparks fresh collaborative dialogues. In the world of arts, it propels the creation of innovative works through interdisciplinary partnerships.\n\nThis movement transcends the pursuit of extensive proliferation; it's about valuing quality and the long term, stability over flux, unity over division. It's about the enchantment that blossoms when diverse minds come together to pursue shared objectives.\n\nAs we navigate this digital age, the Mesmer serves as a reminder that art embodies an authentic movement and the most robust foundation for connections. It underscores the enduring value of impactful, long-term construction. In a world teeming with artists, this movement upholds the notion that art serves as both the point of origin and the ultimate destination, the bedrock of our triumph and contentment.\n\n## Rationale\n\nFinance a program/council that establishes a foundation for other projects with the aim of promoting art and providing a secure space for artists and digital art. (1) aesthetic diversification beyond the illustrative premise, (2) create a culture where the meme is implemented and placed in solid proliferation.\n\n*“What moves men of genius, or rather what inspires their work, is not new ideas, but their obsession with the idea that what has already been said is still not enough.”*\n\\- Eugene Delacroix\n\n## Aesthetic diversification beyond the illustrative premise\n\nThe world of digital art is currently undergoing a significant and innovative transformation. At its core lies the meme – a seemingly straightforward yet incredibly adaptable form of cultural expression. It appears as a flaw to me that the art within Nouns is predominantly characterized by an illustrative premise or animations. Memes are inherently multifaceted, effortlessly adjusting to diverse cultural contexts, languages, and trends. As such, the meme stands as an artistic formula that transcends boundaries, championing inclusivity and encouraging artists from various backgrounds to engage.\n\n*“I really appreciate the idea of Nouns pushing into different art styles.”*\n\\- [willpapper](https://twitter.com/willpapper) (nouner)\n\n*“i'm generally here for us diversifying the way nouns shows up”*\n\\- [Jesse Pollak](https://twitter.com/jessepollak) (nouner)\n\n*“I think showing the diversity of nouns brand to go beyond cute characters”*\n\\- [brennen](https://twitter.com/brennen_eth) (nouner)\n\n\\- Case study: Sensuality in Art\n\nOn the heels of [Prop 392’s](https://nouns.wtf/vote/392) The theme of sensuality, chosen for its delicate nature, served as a canvas for interpretation and became the subject of data research to understand the meme's applicability and the community's perspective on such sensitivity.\n\n“It is highly gratifying to witness the execution of the initial objective and the impact it generated, similar to major discussions such as fork and burn, the community's interest and the division of opinions regarding nounish applications in art is remarkable. The feedback provided, along with the articles published, has been deeply valued and considered in shaping our overall narrative. We have read each one with great appreciation.”\n\n## A culture where the meme is implemented and placed in solid proliferation\n\n***A monthly grant for digital art. Supports 12 Artists for 6 months, and the artist gets the prestige of being in the program. (This results in a total support of $50,000 for each artist.)***\n\n- Abstract Operational Process for monthly grant:\n\nWith the assistance of our curators, a careful selection will be made of the 12 most exceptional and inventive artists who could have nounish inspirations. These artists are anticipated to create and interpret nouns in the most unique way according to their individual artistic visions. They will produce pieces within their respective domains of art, leading to a grand exhibition at the program's conclusion.\n\n*“I'm eager to see which artists will be selected. Personally, I'm a big fan of [XCOPY](https://twitter.com/XCOPYART), and I'd be thrilled to witness one of his unique pieces inspired by Nounish.”*\n\n- Educational Opportunities:\n\nThe program establishes an educational pathway, offering workshops and outreach initiatives that enable artists to impart their expertise and skills to the wider community. Distinguished guests also bring valuable knowledge to the artists. Spaces with guests and other artists will be held every 15 days.\n\n*“Art prevails over the artists who create it and the initiatives that sustain this ecosystem, daring to experiment extensively. While I may not possess knowledge about Nouns or NFTs, but I do have some well-formed ideas about the digital art movement that I can share. I'm here for anything you need.”*\n\\- Anne Laure ( Director Department of Externals Affairs - Musée du Louvre )\n\n***Nounish Friday (Weekly Artistic Celebration): Every week we acquire $2,000 of art nounish.***\n\n- Abstract Operational Process for Nounish Friday:\n\nEvery Friday for six months we will announce on our twitter profile that we are selecting 3 pieces to add to the Nounish Art Vault. Each week, we will invite nouners, notable personalities, esteemed collectors, artists, critics and external guests to participate as our weekly curators. These people will have the privilege of choosing the works of the week and giving a few words about their selections, which will be published on profile every Sunday along with the chosen works.\n\nThis process represents a double honor for the artist: his creation shines under the unique choices made by our illustrious guests. The featured artists of the week will receive a guaranteed financial incentive through the selected pieces.\n\n- Specifications:\n\nThe Nounish Art Vault serves as a safe place where all pieces collected in Nounish Friday will be housed. This way, after the implementation of this program, we will have a vast and varied collection that can be utilized by other nounish projects, exhibitions, and in-person events organized by other builders.\n\n---\n\n## Benefit to NounsDAO Ecosystem\n#\n- **Future support of the artists from the team**\n\nBeyond the contours of a grant program, our commitment resonates on a profound level. The individuals steering this project are not just advisors and curators; they are visionaries, founders deeply ingrained in the art space. These are individuals with their own projects, daily immersed in supporting artists and various programs. Encountering such an opportunity aligns seamlessly with our beliefs and identity. It transcends the soul of grant programs, extending into a space of rich experience, extensive networking, and coveted access—traits cultivated over years at the heart of the art scene, by our team members.\n\nOur involvement goes beyond the grant phase; it's a pledge to personally invest in sustaining the cultural relevance of this project. It involves channeling collective efforts to secure strong collectors, galleries, museums and aspire for inclusion in esteemed institutional collections. As [exemplified by Alejandro's fellowship program](https://x.com/halecar2/status/1718789945857298785), where works found a home at [MOMA](https://twitter.com/MuseumModernArt). We are resolute in our dedication to ensure these works endure as culturally significant entities in the ever-evolving landscape of digital art, etching a lasting presence in the zeitgeist of our space.\n\n\n*Notes:* To start a grant program based on the productions of new art works permits a creation of a legacy. There will be possibilities to create stories, with NOUNS at the center of it, of the different generations that have passed through the program, the interconnections between the different artworks created in the program, the life changing opportunities that the grant will mean to the artists. The life of the grant lives on in all places where these artworks created during the grant period circulate in the artworld. When placed in museums, when collected, when awards are won; all these future moments will be opportunities for the NOUNS brand to proliferate to new places and new eyes.\n\n- **Expansion of Interest/New Members for Nouns: Collectors are to artists they resonate with, as artists are to the art they create.**\n\nIn one of our researches aligned with the created thesis, the current population of art collectors predominantly has [cryptopunks](https://twitter.com/cryptopunksnfts) in their portfolio, actively interacting with them, in addition, a significant portion of collectors express interest in any group or project that supports artists and can potentially become part of such a community.\n\nA substantial number of collectors have a comprehensive understanding of what Nouns represent, and a considerable percentage of them express disinterest because the artists in their collections are not part of such a community, this profile reflects collectors in general. Notably, there is a significant correlation between collectors participating in projects and the frequency with which artists mention them, resulting in higher levels of interactions within the space overall.\n\nEvery collector fondly remembers the initial piece they acquired, although the meaning of that first purchase is different. Many collectors make their first purchase after hearing mentions of specific projects from other collectors and artists. For a significant portion of collectors, the first piece obtained provided them access to a community that aligns with their visions and expectations of artists.\n\n\n*“I love nouns and loved what [Dustin Yellin](https://twitter.com/dustinyellin) x [Artmatr](https://twitter.com/artmatrco). I'm watching what's happening and seeing how it overall affects the community and market.”*\n\\- [Sebastian](https://twitter.com/sebastianss527) (Digital Art at [Christie’s](https://twitter.com/christiesinc))\n\n\nIn the panorama of Nouns and its ongoing projects, a notable gap becomes evident – the absence of initiatives specifically crafted to attract new members. While other developers prioritize proliferation, they fall short on projects tailored to a broader audience that significantly lacks the funds necessary to become a nouner. This observation carries particular weight when considering the broader view that the Ethereum injection brought by new members is a key factor for sustaining activation projects and proliferations to other audiences. This shift in focus considers a niche audience not commonly found at broad events or activations but existing within small communities of collectors, founders, and creators. The common thread uniting these groups is a shared appreciation for art, in essence, collectors who hold funds for such allocations.\n\n![](https://imgur.com/UWJKvmI.jpg)\n![](https://imgur.com/f9MJMAP.jpg)\n*CryptoPunk #110 Centre Pompidou Museum, Paris*\n\n*Notes:* To have this program be successful will open the possibility of a new generation of possible nouners with philanthropic pursuits to join the community. The program is a permanent promotional tool of the NOUNS values through the artists they support. The organic nature of how this works makes for the best advocacy program ever.\n\n- **Impact on the Nouns Brand**\n\nIn a long-term perspective, envisioning that with the execution of this project, Nouns can serve as an exemplary patron for all other projects in the space. It's a visualization possibility that can be considered a \"moment in history.\"\n\n\nWhen contemplating the team involved in this proposal, the depth of experience each member possesses within the art space presents the opportunity to craft distinct narratives. For instance, envisioning a Noun being regarded as a piece of art, displayed in a museum, becomes a plausible prospect. This possibility echoes what was achieved with Cryptopunk at the ICA Museum. The pivotal aspect here is that this project allows for the creation of a narrative, sparking interest and establishing a profound presence within the art space. In the long-term execution, the Nouns brand is cultivated within this narrative.\n\nA recent contemplation revolves around the fact that, despite the remarkable characteristics of Nouns, they are not commonly perceived as works of art. It's an unexplored visualization, which may explain the absence of discussions about Prints among Noun collectors. Nouns Prints are not something they currently visualize adding to the walls of their homes.\n\n**In general terms, we should consider this for conceptual and value structure:**\n\nOne of the things that can also be very attractive to NOUNS and to artists is a framework. What type of conceptual parameters will be explored in the program? Think of this like if you were to join a computer learning program. You would be expected to explore freely but have all work circle back to the core values of computer learning. So to land this in the NOUNS, we need to ask:\n\nWhat are NOUNS conceptually?\nWhat are NOUNS aesthetically?\nWhat are NOUNS in the context of generative art and the history of art?\n\n*For me, the general answers are around these ideas or values:*\n\n-Randomization\n-Collage\n-Seriality\n-Generative art\n-Community\n\nSo in that sense, we build the open call based on those values. It is open to all art practices, but we are looking for artists who want to a)continue to explore these values they already have in their art or b)artists who are interested in exploring their art in the context of these values.\n\nBy doing so, we are creating NOUNS art. Art that is in line with the values of NOUNS. This creates two effects: it validates NOUNS as art and makes these values cross-pollinate with other art forms that may have never considered these values (cinema, video, photography etc). \n\nThough this might seem limiting, it is actually value-centered. Parameters for artists are important and will filter from the start those artists who are willing to commit and expand their vision and welcome those who are interested in the NOUNS values.\n\n---\n\n## Program Organization\n\n1- Open call\n2- Mentorship\n3- Artist conversations\n4- Artist presentations\n5- Monthly work reviews\n\n**Operational Process Breakdown**\n\n1- Open call\n\n*How will we conduct the Open Call for the artist grant?*\n\n- **Awareness:**\n   - 4-week submission timeline\n   - Social media campaign\n   - Weekly Twitter and Instagram posts from all team members + friends with instructions for open-call submissions\n   - @NounsDAO account repost\n   - Strategic 1:1 outreach to artists and communities for encouragement to apply\n   - Weekly public discussions (Twitter spaces, Discord) to answer any questions about the grant and program\n\n- **Application Process**\n   - Define submission dates i.e. December 1, 2023 - December 31, 2023\n   - Create a micro-site that provides concrete instructions for artists to submit proposals and perhaps outlines the project a bit more (who the team is, timeline, and further project details)\n   - Set up a dedicated e-mail address for the submissions\n   - Curators review applications and determine a shortlist of artists for review with the larger team\n   - Weekly meetings with the team to review artist selections throughout the open-call process\n\n- **Example Artist submission form:**\n\n  - Basic info - name, location, social handles\n  - Proposed project overview\n  - Portfolio of 1 or 2 past projects (this is a great filter to see if they have a sense of their artistry)\n  - How do you plan on using the funds to realize the project?\n  - Project Timeline\n  - How the proposal reflects the ethos of the Nouns community\n  - Any other key information i.e.\n      - One (or a few) of the works created will be stored in the Nouns art collection vault\n      - Minimum requirement of works to be created \n\n- **We need to create phases in the process:**\n \n   - Administrative: Applications not complying with the solicited materials get discarded for fairness to all other that do\n   - Review: We all review independently the applications and we can create a simple voting system of 1-5. Best scored projects go to the next phase\n   - Group review: Sessions to advocate for and elucidate projects that we perceive as robust. The final selection of candidates should occur here. -Financial review. We need to come to a consensus about the monetary allocation for each project accepted\n\n*How will we select the artists?*\n\n- **Selection Criteria**\n\n   - Portfolio assessment: artist practice, background, body of work, past work \n   - Dedication to grant application / project: assess how invested the artist is in participating in the project with the quality of the answers in the open call \n   - Project assessment based on:\n      \\- Technical \n      \\- Idea \n      \\- Feasibility \n      \\- Impact on Nouns brand and community \n      \\- Future application (consider the longevity of the project)\n      \\- Resonance with the wider art ecosystem (will it resonate with the audience we are going for?)\n   - Artist profile: where to they come from (we want to be inclusive and build a global program but at the same time due due diligence on the applicants) \n\n- **Things to consider:**\n\n   - Tiered funding approach based on project ambitions?\n   - Tier: “New Voices” for emerging artists. It could be a range (From $$ to $$$)\n   - Tier: “Projects” for working artists with trajectory. Also with a range. \n\nRange permits us to individually value the scope of the project and not over allocate resources to projects that do not require so many funds.\n\nCreate a “cancel of the grant” clause in the open call. I´ve been part of many grant programs and I´ve felt that the ones that have that option tend to have more committed artists. Artists can get entangled and not produce work and for us as a program, would be damaging. Every artist should deliver a project at the end of the grant period. This is absolutely necessary for our longevity.\n\n2- Mentorship phase. \n\nIn this phase the artists that have passed through to be part of the program will have a 1-1 meeting to brainstorm with all curators and advisors. This is needed so that each artist will have a connection and a broad range of reactions to their proposed projects.\n\n3- Artists Conversation\n\nWe invite artists to do group zoom presentations with all the artists. These artists will present their work and motivate the grant artists through how they talk about their creative process, how they build their projects and how they navigate the life of being an artist. We should have at least one a month. These are moments to motivate the artist. The artists we bring should be charismatic and enthusiastic in order to convey their message.\n\n4- Artist presentations\n\nThere should be at three group presentations via zoom where the artists present their projects. One should be at the start of the grant, in the conceptual phase where the projects ar just ideas, a second at the middle of the grant to show the advances of the proposal and the last one as a conclusion of the project. These presentations should motivate the artists to work as they will have to be public about what they are doing and how much effort and proof of work they have for the grant and support they are receiving.\n\n5- Monthly work reviews\n\nEach artist should have a monthly 1-1 meeting with the curators in order to receive concise feedback to the work they are doing. The curator should receive the work previous to the meeting in order to bring to the meeting strong feedback that will help the artist in their pursuit.\n\n---\n\n## CC0\n\nWe will take the initiative to acquaint artists with the significance of CC0, enabling them to decide whether their pieces will be made available under this license or not.\n\nWe hold a shared viewpoint regarding the significance of CC0 for all projects within nouns. However, we acknowledge that each artist may have a distinct perspective on this matter. This is why we opt to offer them a comprehensive introduction to the subject and grant them the autonomy to decide how it applies to their work.\n\n## Transparency\n\nAll funds will be transparently deposited and utilized through the multisig that governs the Mesmer.\n\nIn total, we have five signatories: Two advisors, a trusted nouner, the project sponsor (who is also a nouner), and one of the project's creators.\n\n**Signatories:**\n[Brennen](https://twitter.com/brennen_eth)\n[Alejandro](https://twitter.com/halecar2)\n[Noah](https://twitter.com/cryptopunknoah)\n[Bigint](https://twitter.com/0xbigint)\nProject Creator\n\n***\n\n## Overall Cost\n\n$1,396,000 USDC\n\n*Budget Breakdown*\n\n**Artistry Spotlight - $654,000**\n- A monthly grant for Digital Art.\n$50k x 12 (6 months, each grant totals $50k per artists/ distributed in that period) - $600k\n- Nounish Friday\n$2k x 27 (3 pieces per week/ 6 months/ 27 Fridays) - $54k\n\n**Strategic Vision $553k / 8 months**\n\n- *Advisors Fees - $352k ($11000 per advisor / per month)*\n\n  - Feedback and evaluation\n  - Communication and targeting\n  - Creative oversight\n\n- *Curators Fees - $128k ($8000 per curator / per month)*\n\n  - Curation and relationship with artists\n  - Overseeing and managing\n  - Acquisitions and Deaccessioning\n  - Collection Management and Documentation\n\n- *Strategic guest fees - $40k ($5000k per month)*\n\n  - Communication traction\n  - Organic number planning\n  - Feedback and evaluation\n\n- *Community Manager fees - $33k ($4125k per month)*\n\n  - Engagement and Moderation\n  - Feedback Gathering\n  - Community Building\n\n**Management - $0k / 8 months**\n\nAs creators and founders, we have opted to forgo the budget initially earmarked for our compensation/project management fees.

One key factor to bear in mind is the delicate balance between financial support and the prestige associated with participation. These two elements often intertwine to make such programs successful. Therefore, it is essential to recognize that artists, at various stages of their careers, have distinct needs when it comes to funding and recognition.\n\nFor emerging artists who are just beginning their journey, the appeal of participation and the prestige it brings can be more critical than receiving substantial funding. Their participation adds a sense of freshness and vitality to the program, contributing to its overall appeal. This synergy benefits both the emerging artists and the program itself, creating a dynamic and mutually beneficial relationship.\n\nOn the other hand, more established artists may require a more substantial financial injection into their projects. These artists often carry ambitious visions that necessitate a greater level of funding. Their involvement brings a wealth of experience and influence to the program, further enhancing its reputation.\n\nAs we consider the program's structure, it is prudent to adopt a tiered system of support that caters to the diverse needs of artists. Such a model should not only address the artists' requirements but also leverage the network effect. The network effect relies on the concept that having fewer established artists can generate significant prestige for the program, while having a larger number of emerging artists strengthens the perception of the program as a staunch supporter of the arts.\n\nIn our perspective, a balanced distribution that favors a higher number of emerging artists can serve as a robust and equitable model. It bolsters the emergence of fresh talent and ensures a steady influx of innovative ideas. Simultaneously, it can leverage the prestige generated by established artists to further enhance the program's reputation and reach.\n\nThis project should aim to find the equilibrium between these elements, fostering an environment where emerging and established artists can coexist and thrive. By recognizing the distinct funding and prestige requirements at various career stages, we can create a program that resonates with both artists and the broader artistic community, ultimately enhancing the vibrancy and sustainability of the arts.\n\n## What comes next?\n\nUpon the program's completion, we will draft a new proposal for the main event, extending an invitation to the entire NFT community to experience the artworks of the 12 selected artists. This proposal will outline the event's execution.\n\nIn the future, following the completion of this program, we aspire to delve deeper into the narrative. We plan to create a documentary about the selected artists, exploring their backgrounds, inspirations, and gathering their thoughts on the experience of being part of this program. “Mesmer: The Council\" will be a 12-part documentary, with each episode dedicated to the story of one of the artists featured in the program.\n\nOur concept of art is deeply entwined with individual identity, a driving force behind much of cultural enthusiasm. In this endeavor, we aim to expand and emphasize the influence of personal history. While there is a wealth of knowledge about the artist's work, we seek to uncover the person behind these creations. What inspires them, and what is their creative process like? What is their life story?\n\n\"Mesmer: The Council\" is a unique exploration of creativity. By delving into each artist's identity and artistic journey, we hope to uncover something more profound. This involves masterfully navigating the intricacies of their craft while staying connected to universal themes through a personal perspective. It's quite remarkable to consider how humans have transformed art into an extension of the revolutionary essence of life, and art into an extension of technology.\n\n***\n\nWe extend a gracious invitation for you to consider listening to the recording of our conversation with Brennen, Toady Hawk, and Joshua Fisher on Talking Props.

What is the progress of prop ‘X’? Why hasn't the prop ‘Y’ team shared the bi-weekly updates they promised? What difficulties are the developers of prop ‘Z’ facing that require more time? How much return did prop “V” generate for the treasury?*\n\nThese are just some of the questions that often arise before and after the decision-making process in Nouns community. While we have funded numerous groundbreaking proposals since the DAO’s inception (such as Budweiser Super Bowl ad, the Rose Parade, Nouns E-sports) we’ve also encountered projects trying to take advantage of the DAO and it’s funds as well as builders that raised concerns within the community by not communicating effectively during the development phase.\n\nEven though we have many Nounish data dashboards and tools, we’ve realised that the tracking and evaluation process of funded proposals is not as efficient as it should. Additionally, solely relying on builders to submit reports voluntarily is not effective, leading to suboptimal results. What we lack is a bridge that fills the transparency gap between funded projects and the community.\n\nWe need to establish a set of proposal tracking and evaluation standards based on data, maintain regular communication with funded projects to encourage accountability throughout the community and have a place where all those info are available to everyone 24/7.\n\n![1](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rJKfcxiVa.jpg)\n\n\n# **How?**\nWe’re proposing to establish ThePASS team (the team behind a prominent [DAO aggregator](https://thepass.to/) and [analytical](https://dune.com/thepass) platform) as an accountability third-party service to keep track of each funded project progress by:\n\n**[1]** analyzing the progress of funded proposals by creating a comprehensive evaluation and accountability system\n**[2]** regularly communicating with builders to ensure proposal progress\n**[3]** archiving project updates and compile them into monthly reports\n**[4]** hosting monthly Nounish Townhalls where builders, community and special guests discuss the progress of funded props\n\n![4](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rkl7oejE6.png)\n\n\nThis approach offers several benefits such as:\n* Insights to the building process of funded projects\n* Solid data we can refer to in future decision-making\n* Recognition to the best builders\n* Attract new contributors and investors\n\n***We’re not aiming to be another proposal updates platform but the “bridge” between builders and the community ⌐◨-◨***\n\n# **Execution**\n\n**[1] Evaluation system/Proposal Analysis**\n\nHaving a standard evaluation system ensures fairness and objectivity in the evaluation process as well as helps with accurate measurement, boosts transparency, and assists in making more informed decisions thanks to data.\n\nWe have established a ‘Measurements Standard’ with specific criteria based on project types.

As far as attendees, our goal is to have at least 50 in each Townhall.\n\n# Goals, Deliverables & Timelines\n**Goals**\n\nBy handling the proposal tracking and reporting tasks in an experienced team we solve the ‘builders-community updates gap’ Nouns DAO faces drastically and directly. Community will know where and when they are going to get their proposal updates as well as where to look for past funded proposals info and builders will have to provide those updates to maintain the community's support and trust.\n\nHosting monthly Townhalls will boost community engagement by enabling direct interaction with builders as well as highlight exceptional teams and individuals. On top of that by inviting special guests we make sure projects gain more exposure outside Nouns ecosystem which will help in attracting new builders and investors.\n\n**Deliverables (6 months)**\n* Nouns Proposal Reports archive website\n* 6x Monthly Proposal Reports\n* 6x Townhalls\n\n**Timelines**\n\n* Month 1: Commense website building, Monthly Report #1 , Townhall #1\n* Month 2: Website Building, Monthly Report #2 , Townhall #2\n* Month 3: Website Release, Monthly Report #3 , Townhall #3\n* Month 4: Monthly Report #4 , Townhall #6\n* Month 5: Monthly Report #5 , Townhall #6\n* Month 6: Monthly Report #6 , Townhall #6![3](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/H1kV0ljVa.jpg)\n\n\n# Funding\nWe are requesting 26 ETH in total for 6 months of operations.

These three founders were very early builders in the Nouns ecosystem, without them the most active nounish communities today would not exist. Not only were they behind the earliest iterations of the Nouns auction and DAO structures, they have continued to contribute to the ecosystem as time has gone on.\n\nAs devoted builders in the nouniverse, they have proven their value and alignment with the DAO and would be ideal candidates to receive Nouns. \n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SyYinN_M6.png)\n[*Source (h/t MikeGood, Lil Nouner)*](https://twitter.com/GoodBeats/status/1706019634246213811)\n\nThese communities **far** exceed the size of the community of Nouners.

The Nouns in Rio team is requesting **10 ETH + 10,500 USDC** to create an immersive 2-day event and take Prop House IRL.\n\nWe received so much support from the community [last time](https://nounsagora.com/proposals/360) that we're putting this up again. But unlike our last proposal, which focused on sponsoring a conference and setting up a booth, we're now aiming to host **our very own event.**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/i4GzPZG.png)\n\nThis proposal is set to trigger a waterfall effect within Prop House, starting by **bringing in five new communities.** Each community will open gates for thousands of builders, expanding the platform's reach and impact. Keep reading to find out how we'll do it 👇\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/4tpMuq7.png)\n\nProp House is a platform where communities can fund their builders, so we'll make this event community-focused. We'll allocate **2 ETH to each of 5 communities**, with one essential rule: they must use it to establish their houses and conduct their own rounds on Prop House.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/3AUURR4.png)\n\nPeople will register for the event and indicate which community they belong to. We'll have a preset list of web3 communities in Rio, but participants will also have the option to add their own. We're expecting around 100 attendees.\n‎ \n## How 👀\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/41AKVPW.png)\n\nTo tell the story of Prop House, we need to go back and explain Nouns first. So, the first talk will be about Nouns and how it's growing in Brazil. Then, we'll have a talk about Prop House and how it works. After a break, we’ll host a workshop on writing great proposals and share examples of successful ones.\n\nParticipants will then have free time to write and submit their proposals, detailing the rounds they plan to set up in their new house on Prop House, utilizing the 2 ETH prize as a reward. After that, we'll kick off an afterparty, offering a perfect opportunity for communities to interact and engage with each other.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/0i64qr7.png)\n\nThe second day will start with a talk about the CC0 culture hosted by [Public Good Beer](https://twitter.com/publicgoodbeer). After that, we'll offer a workshop on how to set up a Prop House house and plan rounds.\n\nLast but not least, the voting begins! We'll use a [representative system](https://imgur.com/m5eKE99) for fairness. After voting, we'll announce the winners and outline the next steps. The event will conclude with an amazing Brazilian barbecue, featuring live music and a **Public Good Beer** activation for all to enjoy.\n\nWinning communities will join the Nouns in Rio Discord server. Our team will guide them in setting up their houses, managing rounds, and distributing prizes. If a community doesn't execute its plan within 3 months, **the ETH returns to the DAO.**\n‎ \n## Mentors 🫡\n\n3 mentors will lead the workshop on how to write a good proposal and will be available to assist the teams during the Prop Session. [JP](https://twitter.com/eusou_jp) has submitted dozens of proposals on Prop House, many of which have been approved. [TheBower](https://twitter.com/thebower_) is a Nouner and a Gardener, having voted in many rounds. [Guiriba](https://twitter.com/guiribabrb) is a researcher and has a lot to teach about governance.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/UQw87AM.png)\n‎ \n## Communities 🤝\n\nTwo weeks before the event, we'll start communicating it on our channels, inviting people to apply and explaining how the experience will work. This ensures attendees are well-prepared and ready to actively contribute.\n\nMembers of the [Ponziverse](https://twitter.com/JoeyPonzi) and from the [Casta Crypto](https://twitter.com/castacrypto) community have already signaled interest in being part of the experience, and of course, [NounsBR](https://twitter.com/nounsbr), [Gnars](https://twitter.com/gnars_dao), and [Nouns Graffiti](https://twitter.com/Nounsgraffiti) are all in.\n\nWe'll also be committed to bringing education-focused communities to the event, such as [Educarmais](https://twitter.com/educarmaisrj) and [Futuroon DAO](https://twitter.com/futuroon). Students from UFF, PUC, and UFRJ - three of the biggest universities in Rio - will join us as well. \n‎ \n## Public Good Beer 🍻\n\nDrinks on them! They'll host a talk about the CC0 culture and how the beer was funded by Nouns. Attendees will also receive free beer and collect [gotas.social](gotas.social) NFTs!\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/gZz0uTI.png)\n‎ \n## Why 🤔\n\nWe want communities to see Prop House as a place to fund their builders and individuals to see it as a way to bring their ideas to life. By showcasing the diverse groups already benefiting from the platform, we hope to inspire them to **engage their own communities** in similar ways.\n\nCheck out all the amazing things that have come from Prop House. **Nouns has funded one of the best web3 platforms, and it's high time we spread the word about it.**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/XnCp7Tz.png)\n‎ \n## Where 📍\n\nOur Prop House IRL Experience will be hosted at [casaJOMO.art](https://www.instagram.com/casajomo.art), a super cozy villa located in Santa Teresa, built in the 1930s by two Spanish families. Learn more [here.](https://casajomo.art/about)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/El7FbKV.png)\n‎ \n## Budget 💰\n\nWith **10 ETH**, we aim to support 5 communities, thus benefiting numerous builders and a wide range of projects with significant ETH value. The total event cost, including team compensation, amounts to **10,500 USDC.**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/vXhoJ0z.png)\n‎ \n## Team 🤝\n\nThis proposal is a collaborative effort between [Nouns in Rio](https://twitter.com/NounsInRio) and [Rio Crypto Hub](https://twitter.com/RioCryptoHub), two teams dedicated to promoting web3 in the wonderful city of Rio de Janeiro.\n\n**Nouns in Rio** (represented by [jp.⌐◨-◨](https://twitter.com/eusou_jp) and [Debinvest](https://twitter.com/debinvest)) - successfully organized various nounish IRL events, including [Nouns Week](https://nounsweek.wtf/rio-de-janeiro/), the [Treasure Hunt](https://twitter.com/NounsInRio/status/1574418495911219201), [social actions](https://twitter.com/NounsInRio/status/1606765831064588288) for Prop House's Nounish Holidays and many others.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/2yF0Dc9.png)\n\n**Rio Crypto Hub** (represented by [Douglas Miranda](https://www.instagram.com/daoglasmiranda/)) - an initiative whose principle is to strengthen the web3 scene in the city of Rio de Janeiro, connecting people through monthly IRL events focused on the ecosystem and sharing weekly content on [social media](https://www.instagram.com/riocryptohub/). In 2023, they successfully hosted 30 events.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/iIKp5Vj.png)\n\n**[Guiriba](https://twitter.com/guiribabrb)** - researcher at [Paradigma Education](https://twitter.com/ParadigmaEdu) and [Optimism Português](https://twitter.com/OptimismPT). Funded by Nouns through [Proposal 142](https://nouns.wtf/vote/142) and actively contributor to the NounsBR community. In addition to being a mentor during the experience, Guiriba played a key role in shaping the mechanics and agenda of this event.\n‎ \n## Success ✨\n\nAfter the event concludes, we'll provide the DAO with pictures, an aftermovie, and a detailed report, which will include key metrics such as the number of attendees and submitted proposals, among other details.\n\nTo amplify our impact, we'll actively engage the community through our Portuguese nounish accounts like [@nounsinrio](https://twitter.com/nounsinrio), [@nounsbr](https://twitter.com/nounsbr) and [@thenounsquarebr](https://www.tiktok.com/@thenounsquarebr), as well as Rio Crypto Hub's social channels. The engagement metrics from these channels will be included in our final report.\n\nOur aim is to not just host an event but to foster a thriving web3 community in Rio, turning ideas into impactful projects through Prop House. **Let's take Prop House to the streets!** 💡\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/nlpDpmX.png)","proposer":"0x6ec5A78Ed4755B13A6676dF608125624f66E8fF6","startBlock":18690188,"endBlock":18718988,"executed":true},"votes":[{"support":1,"voter":"0xA86882277E69FbF0a51805cdc8b0a3a113079E63","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":"As stated before i support this for its relatively low cost experiment.

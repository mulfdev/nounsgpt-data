[{"prop":{"id":50,"description":"#  Donate 51 ETH for humanitarian aid to Ukraine through the Rescue Toadz project\n\n## Summary\nDonate 51 ETH for humanitarian aid to Ukraine through the Rescue Toadz (https://rescuetoadz.xyz/) project and incentivize people to donate more.\n\n## Methodology\nRescue Toadz is an NFT collection of 18 toadz in which 100% of the funds are donated to Ukraine via Unchain Ukraine (directly coded in the smart contract). The project has a special bidding mechanic that encourages people to donate more.\n\nThe interesting thing is that you can not only mint toadz, but also match or increase the last donation for an already minted toad and it will automatically be transferred into your wallet. The toad will then drop its noun glasses as POAP in the wallet of the original holder.\n\nThis mechanism is coded directly in the smart contract and a toad owner cannot prevent the toad from hopping into another wallet. The idea is that this will encourage people to donate more. If they want to keep their toad they need to increase the price of the donation or acquire back the toad if somebody donated more.\n\n### Why not donate directly to Unchain?\n\nThe idea is to gamify the donation experience so people will donate more. For example, NounsDAO can donate for already minted toadz and “steal” them from the previous owners. Some of them will then donate again to get their toad back.\n\nThe goal of the proposal is to donate 0.2 ETH for 5 toadz that are already minted and “steal” them from the previous owners and also raise the prices for two other toadz to 10 ETH and 40 ETH respectively.\n\n### Transactions\n\nThe following transactions shall be executed if the proposal is approved:\n\nDonate 5x 0.2 ETH for Rescue Toadz #2, #5, #6, #11 and #16\nDonate 10 ETH for Rescue Toad #15\nDonate 40 ETH for Rescue Toad #8\n\n## Conclusion\nDonating 51 ETH through the Rescue Toadz project has the following benefits:\n\nFunds raised by NounsDAO to help Ukrainian people recover from the war\nRaised popularity of the Rescue Toadz charity project, so more people start donating\nPeople that had their Rescue Toad taken from them are incentivized to get it back by donating again.\nRecue Toadz or Noun Glasses NFTs collected by the NounsDAO","proposer":"0x8e71C9644898665a91E4dB3Dee8bDde97b3C71BC","startBlock":14534602,"endBlock":14554312,"executed":false},"votes":[{"support":0,"voter":"0xf6C625851d48FE26B50D96B821a87eFC7e35c222","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":0,"voter":"0x4754b7e3DEde42D71d6c92978f25F306176EC7e9","numberOfVotes":6,"reason":""},{"support":0,"voter":"0x008c84421dA5527F462886cEc43D2717B686A7e4","numberOfVotes":5,"reason":""}]},{"prop":{"id":51,"description":"# Gnars x Nouns Athletes\n\n![](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/nouns/original/1X/df0297e0030a5dda9107d39db82d67e739e58687.png)\n\n**Background: [Nouns Athletes](https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/small-grants-nouns-athletes/731)** received 3 ETH in funding from Small Grants for a proof of concept. We secured our first signing, [Joe Atkinson](https://www.instagram.com/joeatkinsons), who is currently working on his first Nounish production.\n\nThis proposal aims to facilitate a co-op between [Nouns Athletes](https://twitter.com/nounsathletes) and [Gnars](https://gnars.wtf), a community of action sports enthusiasts ready to expand beyond skateboarding, to all extreme sports.\n\n**Gnars DAO** is a natural progression for a project that’s well positioned to help extreme athletes reach the people, places and things that bring out their best – ultimately proliferating Nouns.\n\n## TL;DR\n\n**Extreme sports DAO tasked with…**\n\n1. Managing a Nouns DAO funded and decentralised treasury\n2. Sponsoring athletes with grants for travel and content creation\n3. Making production, merch, event and protocol decisions\n\n**Requesting 69 ETH** for Gnars DAO to steward an expansion of Nouns Athletes with travel sponsorships across various target disciplines.\n\nie. Gnars DAO (enthusiasts) proliferating Nouns DAO (professionals)...\n\n## Sub-DAOs\n\nNouns DAO inherently [faces a number of challenges](https://twitter.com/0xigami/status/1511601988915523585) around ideation and capital deployment, due to the broadness of application that comes with such an ambitious project.\n\n![](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/nouns/optimized/1X/336a6169a8e534d0e5a38077c5ea7b24a1cfc1d2_2_690x357.png)\n\nAs of 22 March 2022, Nouns DAO has:\n* Received 23,421 ETH\n* Sent 4,784 ETH\n    * Staked 3,000 in Lido\n    * Spent 458 on Foundation setup and ops\n\n**Only 1,326 ETH has been spent on directly proliferating Nouns,** which represents **just 5.66% of total funding raised,** most of which is not visible on the chart above.\n\nSub-DAOs may address the deal flow problems faced by a generalist organisation such as Nouns, by operating as an intermediary for impactful and domain specific capital deployment.\n\n![](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/nouns/optimized/1X/192fa943b3337ed1990092839abbdadd1b181009_2_690x288.png)\n\nGnars began as a simple experiment to see how people value team contributions versus allocation of funds toward meaningful and well aligned charitable causes. As expected, collectors want to see what the future holds and therefore tend toward adequately funding a team – tested using a [Humble Bundle inspired](https://support.humblebundle.com/hc/en-us/articles/204387088-Pay-What-You-Want-and-Contribution-Sliders) contribution slider.\n\n![](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/nouns/optimized/1X/3e838186abf3c575e92ffe393b44445d749b2258_2_690x239.png)\n\nBut perhaps more abstractly, the project was intended to serve as a dip of the toe, to understand whether I personally, should “Skate or DAO?” Having quickly attracted a community of talented and passionate individuals, I’ve discovered that the answer is unequivocally “DAO.”\n\nConnecting with the community has helped me to understand that we are uniquely positioned for experimentation. As a laser focused sub-DAO we can recruit and grow an extreme sports team through fan engagement. \n\nI’m proposing a domain specific sub-DAO structure **– a *SHRED*.**\n\n## Gnars DAO\n\nSkate or DAO -> Shred the Nouns 🤘\n\nGnars aims to operate as a ***Streamlined Hierarchical Really Excellent DAO (SHRED)*** and while the name is a stretch, the concept of ‘shredding the nouns’ can be hyper-focused and impactful.\n\nThe structure allows for off-chain voting with on-chain execution, without dependence on a single centralised entity. This hybrid model is more accessible since individual voters won’t need to pay gas. But it’s also an adequately secure means of sub-DAO treasury stewardship.\n\n![](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/nouns/optimized/1X/b74c48999630dffa607bfd7cbc72f059732d72ee_2_690x238.png)\n\n[Zodiac Reality Module](https://gnosis.github.io/zodiac/docs/tutorial-module-reality/get-started/) ([I've deployed here](https://etherscan.io/address/0xca553AC295EDA95594e77Aa97525Fc815090589a)) enables on-chain execution based on the outcome of events reported by the reality.eth oracle.

Twitter**](https://twitter.com/miguelfaus/status/1500867988341280771?s=20&t=7jVlhyOdDeGSoR8Wg9BoDg)\n\n[![Calladita](https://i.ibb.co/z4f3grt/calladita1.png)](https://www.calladitafilm.com/)\n\n\n## About the Film\n*The movie will be shot in Barcelona (Spain) in September, and is **expected to premiere in International Festivals in spring 2023**, and then in cinemas (there’s distribution agreements in place with Spanish and U.S. distributors) and finally in streaming platforms.*\n*We want this historic web3 movie to have several easter eggs of NFT and Web3 Culture, and the Nouns embody decentralization and CC0 like no other project, so we would love to find ways to showcase Nouns in the film.*\n\n*The entirety of the proceeds from the NFT collection will go towards the budget of the film: locations, equipment rentals, cast & crew, travel & accommodation, post-production…, and so I would like to propose that the DAO contributes to the budget of the film, and in exchange we contribute to “proliferating Nouns” by showing them in this pioneering web3 film.*\n*We believe that “Calladita” has the potential of starting a movement towards the decentralization of cinema via web3, because film is still the most centralized and corporation-controlled art form around.*\n\n## Nouns in Calladita\nNouns will be included in the movie as follows:\n1.    A Character in the film will wear Nouns Glasses in at least 1 scene.\n2.    There will be a chosen Noun put as decoration on the location of the film, which will appear in at least 1 scene. \n3.    Credits: either the Nouns glasses or one chosen Noun will appear in the Credits of the film, and NounsDAO will appear credited as an “Associate Producer” of the movie.\n\n## Funding Request\nThe total budget of the film is 1.4M$, so we’re looking to raise that amount through our NFT collection. We would ask for a **contribution of 6.9 ETH** from Nouns DAO for this collaboration.\n\nTransaction Details:\n```\ntx1: 6.9E to calladita.eth (contribution)\ntx2: 0.25E to apenoun.eth (oversight & coordination)\n```\n\n","proposer":"0x91dCCAA260CC4616E1a6e6b693DB7207C5E42937","startBlock":14562958,"endBlock":14582668,"executed":true},"votes":[{"support":1,"voter":"0xf6C625851d48FE26B50D96B821a87eFC7e35c222","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x01dB485f57Dc000E761b85641F78C9D212A2eEaB","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x83fCFe8Ba2FEce9578F0BbaFeD4Ebf5E915045B9","numberOfVotes":7,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x4754b7e3DEde42D71d6c92978f25F306176EC7e9","numberOfVotes":6,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0xf8A065F287d91d77cD626AF38ffA220D9B552A2b","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x696ed7b26f4B019CEeC78DC8b9140ad64A6f354B","numberOfVotes":10,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0xa4e232FcEedb3f43c8e707F8CF20B6BcF30f10E1","numberOfVotes":2,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x6D40c2da94C6522E361904383c37c605F39B8E73","numberOfVotes":5,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x6924686B3DCD04Ae8ef91a3fEccC262d020F519D","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x3F58588B59dA010031Dd8A355dCD7De229663ebf","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x353224270c2C9a7eCcE7d8dBA98a61587da6F50a","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0xcEb78aBFad166C11e350156fd671b385265a6C87","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0xa555d1Ee16780B2d414eD97f4f169c0740099615","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x1e32a859d69dde58d03820F8f138C99B688D132F","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x1977C4B06a76c160EfF920c67FbC0635124364c8","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":2,"voter":"0xb9d7a0daa17c1Ffe90C27b0FE3b38FF07edc9937","numberOfVotes":0,"reason":""},{"support":2,"voter":"0xf86A6FA100f50e9E715b57D176214c93e6d6bCEa","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x387a161C6b25aA854100aBaED39274e51aaffffd","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0xE8D24bE3ABF6EB27B800F752A969D3C1E84fD401","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x2573C60a6D127755aA2DC85e342F7da2378a0Cc5","numberOfVotes":25,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x8323f1C687F7e2296EC71eE3549a7430ea7Ec730","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0xcC2688350d29623E2A0844Cc8885F9050F0f6Ed5","numberOfVotes":7,"reason":"we

Now we need to start tooling and factory prep for production:\n\n2A: Tooling \nDevelopment and production of high quality precision steel molds for the mass manufacturing process.\n \nSample molds produced by Bigshot in similar materials\n\nInjection molds- ABS and PC (Polycarbonate), plus packaging design/layout, packaging dies & blister tray molds: \nCost estimate: $25-32K (10 ETH equivalent) \nAbove includes: Paint molds, tampo molds for keychain and any QR codes. Any kind of debugging and pilot run to test viability and revisions. \n\nNotes on tooling: tooling is a one-time charge, unless we need to increase bulk production to meet demand and make X more molds etc. Molds will be stored for reuse as needed.\n\n\n\n\nDeluxe gift box packaging, Satin finish with Spot UV, High gloss printing, Blister tray packaging packed in individual shippers for easy distribution. 5 ps per carton, and 4 cartons to master carton. Notes on package design: The package concept has space on it to showcase approximately 20+ nouns characters. We can chose the most Nounish or pleasing pieces that work in the layout (would love a list and images ASAP if community wants to weigh in)\n\n\n2B: Production\nCost estimate $13-17 USD per unit packaged as a final product\nSRP: $20-22 wholesale, $40-45 retail \n\nThe goal of these is to distribute as many as possible so these can be allocated as giveaways to shows and events or sold at a wholesale price giving the event an opportunity to make money.\n\nSample first order breakdown:\n\n5000 pcs Incl. 500 GOLD NOUNDER GIFTS:\n3000 red \n1000 blue \n500 TBD (Pink ???)\n500 BLACK \n500 CHROME GOLD -exclusive to NOUN holders and only available through our gated shop\n\nIF Noun Holders want one of each  of any exclusives we need to consider additional orders\n\nBest to make first order as large as possible to cover any events during the next 6 months to 1 year \n\nImportant to consider the Nounish community needs for these Funglasses in the initial order so that there is enough stock on hand to satisfy any and all proposed promotional efforts.\n \n2C: Logistics and shipping\n \nAir shipping for samples and any show exclusives\nSea shipping for mass production\nAll items shipped to our 3PL warehouse in the USA for warehousing & fulfillment.\n\nUnless otherwise specified, Bigshot will act as a custodian for the physical glasses products and continue to develop new colors and possible tie-ins with other brands.\n\n\n\n\n\n2D: Maintaining stock & availability in USA\n\nBigshot will maintain a public-facing web shop with stock. We will make quantities of glasses available to Nouns at the discretion of the DAO for events and promotions and any other purpose. Will allocate specified quantities to Noun holders through our gated web store at no cost.\n\nShould there be event planning for future activities where we would need to manufacture exclusive products in special colors or packaging, or larger quantities, we need about 4-6 months notice at least. Air shipping is always available to expedite delivery but that is much more expensive than slow sea shipping.\n\nNeed to create web content for any scans of QR codes or Box scans to launch interactive elements like 3D AR Nouns or animated 3D Nouns.\n \nNounish community benefit: each Noun holder or friend /family could claim 5 free sets of glasses + shipping and handling worldwide (for example). If there are 300 Noun holders, and each holder gets 5 free glasses, then we need to plan for US stock to be depleted by 1500 units right away.\n\nThe rest of the stock will be available in the shop at a $40 USD retail but allocated to the various events and promotions as needed at a wholesale of $20 each. \n\n\n\n\n\n2E: Sundries associated with creating and selling physical goods\n\nWe would need to purchase LIABILITY INSURANCE\nCost estimate: $6-8K per year (or ETH equivalent)\n\nIn all instances, when paying for physical goods projects in ETH, we need to address the volatility of ETH. We would need to convert all ETH payments into fiat immediately in order to pay vendors like factories, warehouse, logistics companies etc.\n\nSuggestion to establish quarterly payment to maintain all of the parts moving.  Warehouse, logistics/production manager etc\n\n2F: Global Community Engagement Strategies\n\nPromoting Noun glasses & increasing visibility of the brand. Some of our ideas include:\n\nToy & pop culture conventions around the world (UK toycon/DCON, TTS, Wonder festival Design Fiesta, Shanghai toy show, beijing toy show etc)\nNFT-related meetups & events\nSports events Pro and college level - Funglasses giveaways at stadiums\nPromotional tie-ins e.g. Bud Light? \nCommercial use / brand use of the products Custom glasses frames with unique packaging similar to Bearbricks\nArt shows and events like a space at ART Basel (wynwood walls or SCOPE) , a DesignerCon takeover, a booth at NYCC, etc\nActive social media placements through targeted giveaways and event appearances documented on social media \nDCON TAKEOVER (NOUN-A-PALOOZA) with a 20x30 or larger booth experience with DJs, live art and activities  (papercraft, coloring books. DIY glasses projects etc) - featuring all of the current & upcoming Nounish projects sponsored by the DAO presented as a case study for what is possible with Nouns and more.\n5000 sets of glasses insert into the VIP bags at Dcon\nA NOUNTOWN in a metaverse, a place to hold events, art shows etc. DECENTRALLAND or?\nWe could use Funglasses in an onboarding package for new community members, both Nouners and newbs. - can have QR codes to easily disseminate info about the Nouns community and what is available to community members - answering the questions who, what and why?\nInfluencer mailers\n\n\nTiming of New Production Projects:\nAny Funglasses needs / events that the community decides upon that would overrun our available inventory in the USA warehouse would have to be communicated to us within a timeframe that allows us to quote on, produce and ship the required goods. Both air and sea shipping are extremely expensive these days, so a lot of advance planning is required for bigger production projects (ideally 4 months advance notice, can be cut to 3 months if we do air shipping).\nCost estimate: TBD\n\nOne way to avoid long production delays is to initially produce an overage of thousands of pairs of glasses in the main colors and store them in our USA warehouse so we have an abundance of stock to ship out as needed.\n\nWarehousing extra units has a cost - our warehousing partner charges by square foot. So we would need to estimate monthly cost of keeping the inventory based on how many units we keep on hand and how long we intend to store them.\nCost estimate: TBD\n\n\n\n\nDue to fluctuating ETH value and the fact that we need to immediately convert ETH into fiat to send to factory, we need to calculate each of the above payments right before it is due.\n\n \nLETS GO!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSUMMARY OF COSTS:\n\nOVERALL FUNGLASSES ESTIMATED PROJECT COSTS\n(not including marketing / community engagement)\n\nTooling: 10 ETH *Note Small Grants is giving 5E to get this going now\nProduction @ 5K units: 26 ETH\nShipping / logistics estimate: 5 ETH\nWarehousing for 1 year: 4 ETH\nLiability insurance for 1 year: 3 ETH\n\nTOTAL ESTIMATE: 48-55 ETH (approx 0.01 ETH per unit)\n\nExpenses for a 2nd order would be lower per unit due to the elimination of the one time costs.\nSIMPLE PAYMENT BREAKDOWN:\n\nSharkDAO & Bigshot Multi-Sig -    0x6C3A3374f1250597431d4ead59C35FBadf132b40\n\n#1 tooling payment due ASAP to begin - 10 ETH (project is ready to go - there is a 35-45 day process between initial payment to test shots stage)\n#2 - 30 days later - production deposit payment 50% of whatever production ends up being\n(There may be minimal fluctuations in costs due to the deluxe packaging) \n#3 - 45 days  later - final balance production due\n#4 - 30 days later logistics - costs determined at time of payment due\n\nStill trying to figure out the final cost/process etc on the small details as it is pretty involved and needs to be developed for this and future projects. \n\n","proposer":"0xBd7Dbab9AEb52D6c8d0E80fCeBdE3af4CC86204A","startBlock":14586605,"endBlock":14606315,"executed":true},"votes":[{"support":1,"voter":"0xf8A065F287d91d77cD626AF38ffA220D9B552A2b","numberOfVotes":2,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x5ca6a2e5f53a48616d4ead87fF6034fc032D4722","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":"GO PLACIDLY amid the noise and the haste, and remember what peace there may be in silence.

This proposal is to fund the initial run and launch of the physical and NFT components of this project. More details here: https://ivory-pine-ebc.notion.site/NounsDAO-Proposal-29a658f763f74f958f7c6bd916533dbb.\n\n## Upcoming plan\n\nWe’re planning to launch these as an NFT collection of limited-edition glasses. Each NFT is *consumable* in the sense that it can be used *once* to redeem a physical pair. Once the NFT is used, a boolean value is flipped to indicate consumed status and the underlying tokenURI is permanently changed. A physical pair of sunglasses is then sent to you.\n\n**~7.2% of supply reserved for NounsDAO Treasury**\n\nThe total supply of the collection will be 6969 units. This project would not have been possible without the NounsDAO and the treasury.  As a thank you, we’ve decided to allocate ~7.2% of the supply to the treasury (500 units). We hope to make other such contributions as a thank you to the DAO in the future. \n\n**Custom Edition Glasses Just For Noun holders**\n\nWe’re also making a custom “special edition” pair *exclusively* for noun owners. The design of these glasses will be based off of the under-appreciated and rare “disco” glasses featured on some nouns. *There will only 500 of these glasses ever made, and will be available to the first 500 nouns during mint. This means, future nouns (up to #500) will also be able to receive the glasses.*\n\n## *High-level todos that still remain*\n\n- **Create Smart Contract, Website, Minting, and Redeeming Experience.**\n    - Have had a preliminary call with @blequity at Zora and will be using Zora’s smart contract system to launch this NFT.\n    - Both Signora Armati and I are software engineers so will be able to build most of this —but we may hire 1 or 2 engineers to accelerate the timeline.\n- **Finalize a storage/distribution facility for shipping the sunglasses.**\n    - We’ll need to organize a distribution facility which will serve a few functions:\n        - Long-term storage of glasses (for those that are unredeemed or redeemed later)\n        - We have items coming from multiple manufacturers (Sunglasses, Nouns Box, Carrying case, polishing cloth, thank you cards) — and will need an area to assemble and ship out all boxes.\n- **Promotional Video / Ad**\n    - We want to create a fun promo (IRL) video that showcases the glasses + nouns brand. We’ve had a preliminary call with [@jasonmorena_](https://twitter.com/jasonmorena_) (who was previously the filmmaker for Gary Vee) who has expressed interest in creating an ad for us.\n- **Finalize glass design and create units at scale.** \n\n### **Funds Requested**\n\n- 115Ξ for creating the smart contract, website, promotional/marketing material (this will be most of the remaining work), distribution facility, and to start manufacturing.\n- 1 Noun of the DAO's choice upon successful delivery of the first physical pair of glasses.\n","proposer":"0x2573C60a6D127755aA2DC85e342F7da2378a0Cc5","startBlock":14593484,"endBlock":14613194,"executed":true},"votes":[{"support":1,"voter":"0xf8A065F287d91d77cD626AF38ffA220D9B552A2b","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":2,"voter":"0x008c84421dA5527F462886cEc43D2717B686A7e4","numberOfVotes":5,"reason":"For the Proposal for the 115 ETH, but the addition of the Noun compensation is different than what was proposed before this got on chain (doc still reflects this) and is a major change.

Naturally it's a contentious and painful topic to discuss. Before seeing what the project delivers, how are we to know what the success reward should be? People are mostly arguing that 1 noun is a lot, but it can also be much too little. Ultimately, the correct success reward is infinitely harder to decide upon before the fact and can lead to much wasted heartburn each time. This is why I’d advocate for us to put into place something like [Retroactive Impact Rewards - Nouns](https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/retroactive-impact-rewards/884) to establish trust with proposers that we will reward success fairly and generously such that we can move the reward discussion moment to AFTER the project is delivered rather than before. In lack of such process and trust in the current state, I do not see it as bad faith or form that a proposer asks for what they want upon success as part of their funding proposal ask. I’ll leave the ambiguity of “successful delivery” which is the 1 noun delivery criteria outside of this discussion. I’m imaging there’s some judgement by the DAO to make when the time comes and should be additional incentive alignment for the proposer to actually deliver something clearly successful in order to earn the noun without debate.

It is an NFT collection of 18 toadz with 100% of the funds being donated to Ukraine via Unchain Ukraine. A special bidding mechanic encourages people to donate more.\n\nThe gamified aspect is that you can not only mint toadz, but also transfer someone else’s toad in your wallet by matching or increasing their last donation. The toad then drops its noun glasses as POAP in the wallet of the original holder.\n\nThis mechanism is coded directly in the smart contract and a toad owner cannot prevent the toad from hopping into another wallet. This encourages people to donate more - if they want to keep their toad they need to increase the price of the donation or acquire back the toad if somebody donated more.\n\n100% of the funds are immediately sent from the Rescue Toadz smart contract to Unchain Ukraine. It is a pure charity project - the project devs make no money from it.\n\n## Why not donate directly to Unchain?\nThe idea is not only for Nouns DAO to donate, but also to encourage other people to donate as well. For example, NounsDAO will donate for already minted toadz and “steal” them from the previous owners. Some of them will then donate again to get their toad back.\n\nThe goal of the proposal is to donate 0.2 ETH for 5 toadz that are already minted and “steal” them from the previous owners and also raise the prices for two other toadz to 10 ETH and 40 ETH respectively.\n\n## Conclusion\nDonating 51 ETH through the Rescue Toadz project has the following benefits:\n\nFunds raised by NounsDAO to help Ukrainian people recover from the war\nRaised popularity of the Rescue Toadz charity project, so more people start donating\nPeople that had their Rescue Toad taken from them are incentivized to get it back by donating again.\nRecue Toadz or Noun Glasses NFTs collected by the NounsDAO\nRaised popularity of the iconic Nouns Glasses, which are dropped as POAP for everybody that participated","proposer":"0x8e71C9644898665a91E4dB3Dee8bDde97b3C71BC","startBlock":14599075,"endBlock":14618785,"executed":false},"votes":[{"support":0,"voter":"0x008c84421dA5527F462886cEc43D2717B686A7e4","numberOfVotes":5,"reason":""},{"support":2,"voter":"0xf86A6FA100f50e9E715b57D176214c93e6d6bCEa","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":0,"voter":"0x4754b7e3DEde42D71d6c92978f25F306176EC7e9","numberOfVotes":11,"reason":""},{"support":0,"voter":"0x32d1A53f6709a03f4b6cf4cb0501204ba188d4f5","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":0,"voter":"0xa555d1Ee16780B2d414eD97f4f169c0740099615","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":0,"voter":"0xf8A065F287d91d77cD626AF38ffA220D9B552A2b","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":"Thought we already down voted this proposal, lol"},{"support":0,"voter":"0x83fCFe8Ba2FEce9578F0BbaFeD4Ebf5E915045B9","numberOfVotes":7,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x8e71C9644898665a91E4dB3Dee8bDde97b3C71BC","numberOfVotes":3,"reason":""},{"support":0,"voter":"0x5ca6a2e5f53a48616d4ead87fF6034fc032D4722","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":"I believe that the definition of definition is reinvention. To not be like your parents. To not be like your friends. To be yourself.\n\nCompletely.\n\nWhen I was young I had no sense of myself. All I was, was a product of all the fear and humiliation I suffered. Fear of my parents. The humiliation of teachers calling me “garbage can” and telling me I’d be mowing lawns for a living. And the very real terror of my fellow students. I was threatened and beaten up for the color of my skin and my size. I was skinny and clumsy, and when others would tease me I didn’t run home crying, wondering why.\n\nI knew all too well. I was there to be antagonized. In sports I was laughed at. A spaz. I was pretty good at boxing but only because the rage that filled my every waking moment made me wild and unpredictable. I fought with some strange fury. The other boys thought I was crazy.\n\nI hated myself all the time.\n\nAs stupid at it seems now, I wanted to talk like them, dress like them, carry myself with the ease of knowing that I wasn’t going to get pounded in the hallway between classes. Years passed and I learned to keep it all inside. I only talked to a few boys in my grade. Other losers. Some of them are to this day the greatest people I have ever known. Hang out with a guy who has had his head flushed down a toilet a few times, treat him with respect, and you’ll find a faithful friend forever. But even with friends, school sucked. Teachers gave me hard time.\n\nI didn’t think much of them either.\n\nThen came Mr. Pepperman, my advisor. He was a powerfully built Vietnam veteran, and he was scary. No one ever talked out of turn in his class. Once one kid did and Mr. P. lifted him off the ground and pinned him to the black board. Mr. P. could see that I was in bad shape, and one Friday in October he asked me if I had ever worked out with weights. I told him no.\n\nHe told me that I was going to take some\nof the money that I had saved and buy a hundred pound set of weights at Sears. As I left his office, I started to think of things I would say to him on Monday when he asked about the weights that I was not going to buy. Still, it made me feel special. My father never really got that close to caring. On Saturday I bought the weights, but I couldn’t even drag them to my mom’s car. An attendant laughed at me as he put them on a dolly.\n\nMonday came and I was called into Mr. P.’s office after school. He said that he was going to show me how to work out. He was going to put me on a program and start hitting me in the solar plexus in the hallway when I wasn’t looking. When I could take the punch we would know that we were getting somewhere. At no time\nwas I to look at myself in the mirror or tell anyone at school what I was doing. In the gym he showed me ten basic exercises. I paid more attention than I ever did in any of my classes. I didn’t want to blow it. I went home that night and started right in.\n\nWeeks passed, and every once in a while Mr. P. would give me a shot and drop me in the hallway, sending my books flying. The other students didn’t know what to think. More weeks passed, and I was steadily adding new weights to the bar. I could sense the power inside my body growing. I could feel it.\n\nRight before Christmas break I was walking to class, and from out of nowhere Mr. Pepperman appeared and gave me a shot in the chest. I laughed and kept going. He said I could look at myself now. I got home and ran to the bathroom and pulled off my shirt. I saw a body, not just the shell that housed my stomach and my heart. My biceps bulged. My chest had definition. I felt strong. It was the first time I can remember having a sense of myself. I had done something and no one could ever take it away.\n\nYou couldn’t say s–t to me.\n\nIt took me years to fully appreciate the value of the lessons I have learned from the Iron. I used to think that it was my adversary, that I was trying to lift that which does not want to be lifted. I was wrong. When the Iron doesn’t want to come off the mat, it’s the kindest thing it can do for you. If it flew up and went through the ceiling, it wouldn’t teach you anything. That’s the way the Iron talks to you. It tells you that the material you work with is that which you will come to resemble.\n\nThat which you work against will always work against you.\n\nIt wasn’t until my late twenties that I learned that by working out I had given myself a great gift. I learned that nothing good comes without work and a certain amount of pain. When I finish a set that leaves me shaking, I know more about myself. When something gets bad, I know it can’t be as bad as that workout.\n\nI used to fight the pain, but recently this became clear to me: pain is not my enemy; it is my call to greatness. But when dealing with the Iron, one must be careful to interpret the pain correctly. Most injuries involving the Iron come from ego. I once spent a few weeks lifting weight that my body wasn’t ready for and spent a few months not picking up anything heavier than a fork. Try to lift what you’re not prepared to and the Iron will teach you a little lesson in restraint and self-control.\n\nI have never met a truly strong person who didn’t have self-respect. I think a lot of inwardly and outwardly directed contempt passes itself off as self-respect: the idea of raising yourself by stepping on someone’s shoulders instead of doing it yourself. When I see guys working out for cosmetic reasons, I see vanity exposing them in the worst way, as cartoon characters, billboards for imbalance and insecurity. Strength reveals itself through character. It is the difference between bouncers who get off strong-arming people and Mr. Pepperman.\n\nMuscle mass does not always equal strength. Strength is kindness and sensitivity. Strength is understanding that your power is both physical and emotional. That it comes from the body and the mind. And the heart.\n\nYukio Mishima said that he could not entertain the idea of romance if he was not strong. Romance is such a strong and overwhelming passion, a weakened body cannot sustain it for long. I have some of my most romantic thoughts when I am with the Iron. Once I was in love with a woman. I thought about her the most when the pain from a workout was racing through my body.\n\nEverything in me wanted her. So much so that sex was only a fraction of my total desire. It was the single most intense love I have ever felt, but she lived far away and I didn’t see her very often. Working out was a healthy way of dealing with the loneliness. To this day, when I work out I usually listen to ballads.\n\nI prefer to work out alone.\n\nIt enables me to concentrate on the lessons that the Iron has for me. Learning about what you’re made of is always time well spent, and I have found no better teacher. The Iron had taught me\nhow to live. Life is capable of driving you out of your mind. The way it all comes down these days, it’s some kind of miracle if you’re not insane. People have become separated from their bodies. They are no longer whole.\n\nI see them move from their offices to their cars and on to their suburban homes. They stress out constantly, they lose sleep, they eat badly. And they behave badly. Their egos run wild; they become motivated by that which will eventually give them a massive stroke. They need the Iron Mind.\n\nThrough the years, I have combined meditation, action, and the Iron into a single strength. I believe that when the body is strong, the mind thinks strong thoughts. Time spent away from the Iron makes my mind degenerate. I wallow in a thick depression. My body shuts down my mind.\n\nThe Iron is the best antidepressant I have ever found. There is no better way to fight weakness than with strength. Once the mind and body have been awakened to their true potential, it’s impossible to turn back.\n\nThe Iron never lies to you. You can walk outside and listen to all kinds of talk, get told that you’re a god or a total bastard. The Iron will always kick you the real deal.

We’ve had 27 guests on over 9 episodes from extension builders to board members to DAO members and even Bud Light. I aim to keep these conversations interesting and informative, and I have a ton of other folks lined up and would love to keep working on this. I’d like to add a theme song and edit the audio while continually hosting these live on a weekly basis and then publishing to all podcast platforms.\n\n**3.

I’m requesting 214 ETH (120 funding props / 94 opex) to continue to explore the Prop House model as a way to scale capital deployment over the next 4 months. \n\n### What has  happened since [Prop 23](https://nouns.wtf/vote/23):\n- Built [prop.house](https://prop.house) \n- Funded 9 proposals for a total of 15 ETH\n- Received 69 proposals over two funding rounds (third round kicked off 4/13)\n- Opened dialogue with extension communities to onboard into Prop House, holding conversations with leaders and community members to understand their footing.\n- Gained 1,000+ followers on the Prop House twitter account\n- [Expense report](https://airtable.com/shr5UPKk4jyhveIDd)\n\n### Reflections:\n\n**Quality proposals**\nThe two core hypotheses with initial testing were that 1) there would be a meaningful volume of proposals given the ETH<>Proposal auction format and 2) some subset of proposals would be high quality. With 69 proposals and a double digit % of those being highly desirable, I feel confident that we should continue to pursue scale via the prop house model.\n\n**Communities are eager to participate**\nWith a total of 48 proposals and 520 votes casted by 77 non-nouners for Round 1, it’s clear that members of the broader community, both individually and as part of extension communities, are eager to participate. It’s behavior like this that points to how NFT communities can grow beyond their ownership-constrained communities (particularly true for Nouns).\n\n**DAO-only voting won't scale**\nGiven the volume of proposals received in Funding Round 1, it's clear that a Prop House where only Nouners are voting won't enable us to scale to 1000s of proposals. i.e. It's irrational to expect Nouners to be reading through 50 proposals every week. If we are to hit scale, decision making needs to be gradually decentralized. \n\n### Beyond funding - a new way to interact:\nFraming the ERC721 standard as the social graph, Prop House may be looked at as a “permissionless ETH power source that communities gather around” (h/t joel).\n\nAnalogous to reddit, we now have crypto-native subreddits but are missing the key ingredient that makes crypto so special - the ability to transact, transform and create value. \n\n**With this proposal**, Prop House looks to do two things:\n1) Focus development on the Nouns Prop House as the main node in the network:\n    - Nail down UX \n    - Experiment with different funding amounts, longer and shorter rounds \n3) Explore the ways in which the DAO can further its reach via independent Prop Houses (e.g. prop.house/**japan**, /**extensions**, /**budlight**)\n    - Enable these communities to become self-curating Prop Houses where their members both submit and vote on their own proposals.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/kQ1JnVC.png)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/le4Q4Xz.png)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/ElCNZge.png)\n\n\n### Team:\n- seneca (all hats)\n- devcarrot (backend)\n- toastee (design)\n- cdt (frontend)\n- jckbutcher (memes)\n\n### Budget:\n\nWe are requesting working + funding capital for **4 months** of operations. \n\n- Funding props, 120 ETH:\n    - 80 ETH for Nouns Prop House\n    - 40 ETH for 1-3 Nouns extensions Prop Houses (e.g. japan, nounpunks, budlight)\n- Operational, 94 ETH:\n    - 23.5 ETH per month:\n        - 10 ETH seneca \n        - 3.5 ETH devcarrot\n        - 3.5 ETH toastee\n        - 3.5 ETH jckbutcher\n        - 3 ETH for other potential misc expenses \n\n**Considerations**\n- Funding schedule is meant to be flexible so that we can both experiment (diff funding amounts) and slowly ramp up (i.e. start with 1 extension prop house)\n- Funding amounts and corresponding communities will be decided internally by the Prop House team. Some of the heuristics we are using to select communities:\n    - Enough activity to merit competition between proposals\n    - Willingness to onboard from leadership\n    - Alignment with nounish culture and proliferation\n- The ideal and final version of Prop House would allow for all decisions with regards to funds leaving the DAO to be decided upon by Nouners via vote. \n\n**Multi-sig**\nThe [multisig](https://etherscan.io/address/0x5BcD6f3B0a5519D448FBDf33204091bbE097C992) is currently 2/3 where the signers are seneca, devcarrot and toastee. It still holds ~20 ETH from [prop 23](https://nouns.wtf/vote/23). With the passing of this proposal, we will be adding 2 more signers (cdt and jckbutcher). The addresses are as follows:\n- safe: 0x5BcD6f3B0a5519D448FBDf33204091bbE097C992\n- seneca: 0xfC9e8dB5E255439F430e058462360Dd52b87cB4f\n- devcarrot: 0xB1C41C71d36cedEa7DdCd5f8D5c5C32BA8f3CBFc\n- toastee: 0x5F99FC2d2A98e046t9689d3117e0F96bb5c640d88\n- cdt: 0xD19BF5F0B785c6f1F6228C72A8A31C9f383a49c4\n- jckbutcher: 0xD1295FcBAf56BF1a6DFF3e1DF7e437f987f6feCa\n\n\n### Closing thoughts\nProp 23 enabled the first experiment of the Prop House model. Given the results, it seems to me that the answer to \"is there something here?\" was a resounding yes. Moving forward, I hope to continue to build with the same framing: an exploration to see what the model can amount to.\n\nFor this next phase, there are a few key questions that I'd like to have more definitive answers to, chief among them: \n- Is the volume of quality proposals meaningful?\n- Will funding align extension/external communities to proliferate Nouns? \n- Is the Prop House model a viable approach to pursue 100x growth? \n\nThe goal of this proposal is to answer these questions by continuing to develop the UX while taking our first steps towards independent Prop Houses.\n\nIf this second phase succceeds, I intend to eventually  develop Prop House into an trustless on-chain solution. As stated in [Prop 23](https://nouns.wtf/vote/23):\n> Conceptually, the contracts could be the seed to a crypto native Y Combinator model. Where as before you had partners, now you have DAO members. Instead of summer and winter batches, you have weekly or monthly cadences. And instead of demographic restrictions for applicants, you have anyone with an Ethereum wallet. It might be the case that breaking thresholds in the categories mentioned above transforms the model to something completely different.\n\nFrom lessons learned in the first phase, I'd reframe it by saying that utilizing only DAO members won't scale. Instead, plugging into open and available social graphs (ERC721) is the way.","proposer":"0x6f9e3976fa3b5b22761fe5D635E1f0d9d9aeB85d","startBlock":14624201,"endBlock":14643911,"executed":true},"votes":[{"support":1,"voter":"0x353224270c2C9a7eCcE7d8dBA98a61587da6F50a","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x6f9e3976fa3b5b22761fe5D635E1f0d9d9aeB85d","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0xf86A6FA100f50e9E715b57D176214c93e6d6bCEa","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x8323f1C687F7e2296EC71eE3549a7430ea7Ec730","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":"Please and thank you.

The goal of these videos will be to reach new audiences to amplify the reach of the projects we have funded.\n- Create a free resource of CC0 Nouns-proposal-related footage and assets.\n\n**The Problem**\n\n- Prop builders don’t necessarily have the skills/resources/time to execute a marketing campaign for their projects.\n- Wonderful projects with really great output are not being amplified and we are missing out on a lot of noun proliferation potential.\n- It’s difficult to explain what Nouns are to the world.\n\n**The Solution**\n\n- We propose to build a team dedicated to market the projects that Nouns fund.\n- We will offer the most promising projects the option to work with us closely to produce a video that markets their project.\n- We will do whatever is necessary to make the videos as compelling and impactful as possible, like:\n    - Develop a compelling story about the project.\n    - Send a film crew to the builders' studio for an interview and B-roll footage.\n    - Edit the videos in different formats for different social media platforms to maximize virality.\n    - Publish the videos on social media accounts - on all major social media outlets: twitter, facebook, instagram, tiktok, and youtube.\n    - Manage interaction with social media followers.\n\n**Why is this awesome?**\n\n- **Tell the Nouns story via the projects we fund**\n    - The best way to tell the story of Nouns is via its funded projects. The projects and builders that the treasury funds are what is nounish. The substance of the proposals are the most compelling and accessible narratives of Nouns DAO. These stories will also attract more builders to submit proposals to the protocol.\n- **Let the builders focus on building**\n    - Builders don’t have to be marketing experts.\n    - We want to enable builders to focus on delivering their projects in the best way - and let us produce the video marketing assets they need.\n    - We hope that potential builders who see these videos will get inspired to create quality proposals themselves, knowing that this support and exposure will be there.\n- **Use the treasury to its fullest potential**\n    - An awesome Nouns-funded project that not many know about is a waste of our treasury.\n    - We will make sure to amplify the work that’s being done by our prop builders and reach a wide audience.\n- **CC0 Nouns Video Stock**\n    - Similar to public domain stock videos, all footage that we will gather in the process of producing these videos will be CC0 and available online\n        - Initially we will share a Google Drive or Dropbox with these files. We will also experiment with posting the footage in CC0 stock video websites like [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/).\n        - In the future, if there’s demand, we may want to build a dedicated website to enable easy access to the footage.\n    - This will enable the composability of our storytelling by giving access to right-free footage to, for example:\n        - Projects like the [Rose Parade documentary](https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/proposal-nouns-go-to-the-rose-parade-a-documentary-by-the-makers-of-robot-chicken/1046) will be able to use our raw footage as part of their documentary, permissionlessly.\n        - YouTubers who produce an explainer video about Nouns.\n        - News outlets who are reporting about Nouns.\n        - All future documentaries about the protocol.\n    - This will enable more “memetic stimulus”: more visual content from our projects can result in more nounish memes!\n\n**Scope of The Pilot**\n\nWe want to start with a small pilot of 4 published videos, delivered within the next few months. These videos will be 30-90 seconds, bite sized content for easy consumption and maximum shareability. They will focus on summarizing a single project/proposal – with a little context about nouns as well.\n\nIn this pilot we want to experiment and learn as much as possible (e.g. How to work best with builders? What content type and format gets the most engagement? How do we manage remote film crews?).  Once we successfully deliver on the pilot and we have learned a ton, we will probably submit another proposal to produce more videos.\n\n- Work with builders to create videos telling the stories of 4 projects:\n    - Confirmed:\n        - Coloring Books by Messhup\n    - Other projects we would love to work with but haven’t fully confirmed yet:\n        - Nouns Psychogeography Sculpture with Dustin Yellin\n        - Perpetual Glasses to Kids In Need\n        - TSP x Nouns: Skateboard Design and Giveaway\n        - Luxury Noun Sunglasses\n        - Hong Kong Takeover\n        - Nouns 3D-printed fashion collection\n- Upload all relevant high quality raw footage to a cloud service and make it available to anyone.\n- Setup, brand, and manage new social accounts for Nounish on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, TikTok & YouTube\n- Share videos to social media accounts\n\n**Team**\n\n**[142](https://twitter.com/danpeguine)**\n\n- Strategy, scriptwriting, and storytelling\n- Coordinating with builders\n- Manage socials\n\n**[Goldy](https://twitter.com/Goldypix) & [Pixel](https://www.pixel.melbourne/)**\n\n- Strategy, scriptwriting, and storytelling\n- All video production: from footage to edited files, film crews\n- Visual brand assets\n\n**Questions or comments?

Think TV, but owned by and voted by the community. \n\n**The finale taking place on May 1st at Webster Hall** is for our first show Proof of Love, a community funded, created, participated, and decided dating show powered by NFTs.

Anyone in the world will be able to text our hotline to vote – similar to American Idol days — and by doing so will be able to mint one of our condom NFTs as well — not so similar.\n\n- 6:30pm ET - Doors Open\n- 7pm ET - Begin airing recap episodes from Season Zero\n- 8pm ET - Final Episode Airs on Youtube and live at Webster Hall\n- 8:30pm ET - One hour long live streamed After Show (with 2-3 musical performances)\n- 9:30pm ET - Winner of finale episode is chosen live\n- 10:30pm ET - Invite only after party at The Jane (you are invited to join us!)\n\n### **Why?**\n\nThe Mad Realities team has mad respect for NounsDAO as one of the pioneers of CC0 as a viable model to spread a decentralized brand & meme.\n\nWe ourselves are making that leap, and the night will mark history as Mad Realities enters Proof of Love into Creative Commons (CC0) and allows anyone to mint full episodes of the show and most meme-worthy clips, and own a piece of reality TV.\n\nIt will be a bold experiment in putting a whole TV show in Creative Commons — along with the infinite stories that we expect our community to tell far into the future.

They host the single largest prize pool tournament in esports, The International. The latest purse for this annual tournament was around $40 million USD. To qualify for The International, you participate in the Dota Professional Circuit (DPC) 2 league which takes place throughout the year. This is mostly an online, regional format, but each season culminates in an international LAN called a Major.\n\nOne of the first initiatives of our esports pod will be to sign “4 Zoomers” 3, a Division 1 North American DPC team.\n\n**Budget: 35 ETH**\n\nThe majority of this budget will be used to compensate the roster of five players, their manager and coach for the upcoming DPC season. The team has agreed to sign from the day the proposal is voted-in until the end of the third DPC season, July 17.\n\nWe will be working with former player and caster Brax to to act as an ambassador and liaison within the Dota community.

In game branding - Dota allows for DPC teams to have in-game branding through assets placed inside of the game’s landscape. Nouns branding will be visible in game as the team competes.\n\n3. Name branding - The team will rebrand from 4 Zoomers to **Nouns Dota**.\n\n4.

This way we ensure an inter-regional promotion of NFTs in the two biggest Cities of Bavaria (total population of ~2M people)\n\n**The first day** introduces the underlying technologies of NFTs such as blockchain and smart contracts through panels and talks. Different areas of application of NFTs and their economic significance will be presented using successful examples from the gaming, fashion and art sectors. A panel discussion will be held to critically examine the technology and its benefits and to take a visionary look into the future of NFTs. On this day, the audience will be introduced to the world of NFTs and informed about the basics and possible areas of application.\n\n**The second day** will be a deep dive into current topics and trends in Web3 and the world of NFTs. Representatives from Web3 projects and companies will present their NFT journey, current strategies and experiences. Trends, technological developments, as well as tax and regulatory aspects will be covered. The crypto and NFT communities and all interested parties are invited to exchange ideas in an interdisciplinary manner on this day.\n\nThe event is planned to attract ~400 people in-person and around the same amount to stream online over the course of 2 days.\n\n# who is organising muc.xyz?\n[Benjabo](https://twitter.com/benjabo): Benjamin Bauer (CEO of [ZOLLHOF](https://www.zollhof.de/) - Tech Incubator) is a long-time fan of blockchain technology. He first invested in Bitcoin and Ethereum in 2016 and went all-in on NFTs early 2021. Fascinated by the new possibilities of the decentralised web3, Benjamin pushes this topic for ZOLLHOF and the German startup ecosystem.\n[Cairol](https://twitter.com/cairol2_0): aerospace engineer, idea creator and value-based leader in the field of innovation and deep tech.\n[Aguwiku](https://twitter.com/aguwiku): architect and urban planner, sustainability and climate protection expert, grew up with art, big fan of tennis.\n[niftynaut](https://twitter.com/niftynaut): noun172, building [swap.kiwi](https://swap.kiwi) to help others swap their NFTs the safe way with each other.\n\n# how will the event proliferate nouns?\nIn general, as the event has an educational approach, we hope also to spread the word about cc0 and convince more builders to think about what kind of license they want to use for their future NFT projects. Moreover, Nouns are not yet proliferating in Europe and sponsoring the conference will help get more attention to the protocol outside of North America.\n\n+ We will let nouns nounify the event completely. Nouns will be THE sponsor who has their logo everywhere where the muc.xyz logo is.\n+ We will have posters around the city to draw attention to the event.\n+ We will nounify our website accordingly.\n+ We will add nouns logo on all of our merchandise which is free for all attendees.\n+ We will nounify the venue accordingly (roll-ups, photo wall).\n+ We will mention nouns in our press release.\n+ We will add a cc0 talk/panel to our event schedule\n+ We organise some side NFT exhibitions - here we have the possibility to display nouns and their story. \n+ With representatives from the city and the state of Bavaria, chances are high that there will be photos circulating in the regional and national newspapers.\n\n# event location and schedule\nwe are hosting the event at the [Haus der Kunst](https://hausderkunst.de/en/) (House of Art) which is a non-collecting modern and contemporary art museum in Munich, Germany.\n![image|\n100%](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f6/Haus_der_Kunst_-_Munich_-_2013.jpg)\nPhotographer: Avda / avda-foto.de\n\nDate of the event is the 27th & 28th of May 2022.\n\nThe NFT event will help to educate the interested public about NFTs. We are sure this event will draw attention to NFTs and blockchain because it is touching the Zeitgeist and there are not many other events to educate the public about this technology in Germany, and so far none in Munich.\n\n**There is still a great need for education and information in Germany.**  **There are a few events, but they differ in their objectives and focus.** \n**So far there are not many events to compare it even with.**\n\nRight now it is a right and important time for our muc.xyz, precisely because there are so many different approaches, ideas, areas of application etc… **Our approach also stands out above all because of the first day, which focuses on critical observation and informing the broader public.**  On top of it, Bavaria has developed its own blockchain strategy. The added value of this technology for society, the economy and even for the administration is seen.\n\nMunich is a hotspot for art! The art scene is alive and well. There are many collectors and art enthusiasts here. There is a lot of “old” culture and a lot of tradition. Our event fits right in as there is a vacuum currently we hope to fill.\nWe are also partnering with [Hackbay](https://www.hackbay.de) which organised many hackathons (200+ participants) and now organises its first web3 hackathon (Sponsors: Adidas, Siemens) in Nuremberg (population of ~800k).\n\nSome more info about Munich:\n* 3rd largest city in Germany, 11th largest City in the EU with a population of 1.6M\n* The city is a global centre of art, science, technology, finance and its economy is based (besides cars) on high tech, creative industries, as well as IT.\n* With large universities it attracts a lot of young people with whom it would be great to connect and educate about web3 and NFTs.\n\n# confirmed speakers\n+ [Annette Doms](https://twitter.com/Annette_Doms)\n+ [Jiayin Chen from Artnet](https://twitter.com/curatingthings)\n+ [snowfrow from Artblocks](https://twitter.com/ArtOnBlockchain)\n+ [Yat from Animoca Brands](https://twitter.com/ysiu)\n+ [Keith from TIME](https://twitter.com/KeithGrossman)\n\nLooks promising to be confirmed soon:\n[Judith Gerlach, Bavarian State Minister for Digital Affairs](https://twitter.com/gerlach_judith)\n\n# Expenses muc.xyz has\n+ venue \n+ catering \n+ event set-up \n+ technical support for the event and renting hardware (venue, exhibition, and streaming the event)\n+ advertisements (print and online)\n+ merchandise\n\n**The money from the sponsorship provided by the nouns will be used to partially cover the expenses (expenses > nouns grant).

This seems to be a bit above industry standard but takes into consideration the CC0 requirement for this experiment.*\n\nCreative Teams (click names for more info)\n 1) [BBDAO 1 - Animated Series - Scott Albert & Will Bryan](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dATW6a93NF5NelKz2PM3ap7HiOUWadFrOpcvmQurMao/edit)\n 2) [BBDAO 2 - Feature Film - Van Robichaux & Garfield Lindsay Miller](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dATW6a93NF5NelKz2PM3ap7HiOUWadFrOpcvmQurMao/edit) \n 3) [Sam Ellis - Animated Series](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yeSJcwZRSygWKAsRIJkQ2fMVY93Qcakax_YtOhOtTkU/edit?pli=1)\n 4) Studio DAO - Mixed Media Noun O'Clock - link\n 5) Greidiens/Keenan Thompson\n 6) TBD Group - \n\nA story bible typically contains a cast of characters, some story ideas, maybe a season 1 arch and is delivered in a fully fleshed out document with drawings, text, etc. Some examples can be found below:\n\nExample Story Bibles:\n[#writers-room, Nouns Discord](https://discord.com/channels/849745721544146955/921486884826406982/961336684505595995)\n\nDeliverables: Based on this thread we expect each Bible to include a general world/universe outline, 15-20 Characters w/ illustrations and character descriptions, 10+ story/episode ideas. We expect these to be illustrated and 20+ pages each.\n\nThe multi-sig would pay the writers on a schedule of 30% Up Front, 20% Upon Rough Draft, 50% Upon Completion. For this first round we will be focused on writer/creator teams that have high level credits and a history of delivering professional works on time.\n\nMulti-Sig: 0x9667Ac39E7534c43Ca1A2a4a5BC4a6FFC2783458\nSharkDAO Multi-Sig (5/7 signer wallet): 0xAe7f458667f1B30746354aBC3157907d9F6FD15E\nJoshuaFisher.eth\n\nStory Foundation & Development Lead \nJawshua Fisher\nI’ve been actively working with the teams, Nouners and Nouncil members on creating this proposal.

For this I am proposing a compensation of 6ETH/month for trial period of 3 months.\n\nAs a creative manager by trade I have experience helping creatives deliver while holding them to high standards and helping with ideas. I've also been here paying close attention since Noun 3 and feel I have a good foundation for many of the fun moments and underlying themes that have been embraced. Finally, I'm a multi-sig signer at SharkDAO and am active in the community. \n\nLegal & Set Up Fees \nI don't have a legal quote but think we could create a simple agreement with writers with a great lawyer for 10E or less, the high cost is due to uncertainty about DAO, CC0, etc. We will send back any unused funds.

The Wenbreakfast DAO.\n\nSo, our next plan is to start a series of spin-offs for a streaming platform. One episode per artist in the Wenbreakfast DAO.\n\nWe hope the artists will wish to join Nouns DAO after watching Dean’s film and going through the experience of being the next talent portrayed in our documentary series.\n\n**MORE ABOUT DEAN**\nAmong other things, he is hosting pixel arts lessons on twitch for the Noun Cats community.\n\nA firm believer in the power of web3, not only he is working full-time on his project with backseats, but he is also building yet another extension, Early Birbs, with his Discord community.\n\nDuring the live sessions, the PFP traits are created with the audience, in real-time.\n\nDean is paying it forward by teaching others the art and technique that transformed his life.\n\n**BUDGET: 12 ETH**\n\nPre-production and research\nProduction: 3 days of shooting in Nelson, NZ with a 5 people team\nPost-production: Editing / Graphics / Grading and online / Audio Mix\nOriginal soundtrack\nROADMAP / TIMELINE\n\n2 months from funding to online/final cut delivered\nTEAM\n\n[Leo Clark](https://twitter.com/leoclark) Discord: leoclark.eth ⌐◨-◨#2267\n[Filmmaker obsessed with NFTs and Nouns evangelist](https://www.linkedin.com/in/leoclarkribeiro/)\n\n[Neil Stichbury](https://www.linkedin.com/in/neil-stichbury-6374794/)\nDirector/producer with over 20 years of experience in factual and commercials.\n\n[Jacob Bryant](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jacob-bryant-4144b01a/)\nDP.

For 25 years this has meant creating and delivering physical goods like toys, collectibles and consumer products, as well as the related 2D and 3D digital files necessary for ad campaigns, animations, commercials, billboards, activations and experiences of all shapes and sizes.\n\nWhile crafting assets and collectibles for clients, Bigshot has also developed and produced a wide range of original collectibles under our own label, and sold them both DTC and B2B through our own shop and various distribution partners. Years of community engagement, several successful Kickstarters, booths at shows like New York Comic Con, DesignerCon, Licensing Expo and other events have allowed us to service an impressive range of happy customers and clients.\n\nWithin the past few years, the unique capabilities of Bigshot have been deployed more and more frequently by NFT project creators as they put out a mix of physical and digital collectibles under their IPs.

The Noun community has shown itself to be forward thinking, enterprising, generous, warm, funny and bold. Everything from donating to Ukraine, making eye glasses for the underprivileged, to being featured in a Super Bowl ad. This is a story worth telling!\n\nThis project will be unique for three reasons:\n\n1. Stoopid Buddy has spent years developing a very specific comedic tone we want to bring to this documentary. The doc will tell the story of the Nouns community and all the amazing initiatives it supports, but will be anchored with a strong narrative - the journey of getting the Nouns into the Rose Parade as the first ever NFT featured. This narrative lends itself to keeping things fun, silly and strange, while providing a strong hook to tether the larger story of Nouns.\n2. As part of the documentary story, we'll be building and featuring six life-size walk around Noun costumes that will spread the Noun ethos through activities the community will have a say in driving. Do we want them handing out glasses? Giving random hugs to people in Times Square? Running in a charitable half marathon? We'll have fun and create great content for the documentary, all while showcasing how the DAO works.\n3. Our story will revolve around the journey to get a giant, vibrant Noun float in the Pasadena Rose Parade in 2023. The film will reach a climactic end with the six life size Nouns partying their way down the Rose Parade with a massive Noun float in tow!\n\n_Tone_\n\nWe're inspired by docs like \"Exit Through the Gift Shop\" which was light, playful, and blurred the line between real and imagined. We want to tell this story in an imaginative way, often with tongue firmly in cheek.\n\n_Why?_\n\nWe are inspired by this community and think the world needs to know how amazing and revolutionary this DAO is. We also think this is a great way to get this organization and brand out to a much wider audience. The Rose Parade will create tens of millions of impressions but the documentary will give this story life and legs and tee up the Nouns to further their reach into mainstream pop culture.\n\n_Who are we?_\n\nWe are [Stoopid Buddy Stoodios](https://www.leagueofbuddies.com/). Most of you might know us from our flagship series, [Robot Chicken](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuWZzOusVJ8), but we're also the studio behind Marvel's MODOK, Crossing Swords on Hulu, and all the costumes on FOX's [Masked Singer](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/the_masked_singer-characters-publicity-split-h_2019.jpg). And the studio that built a 15 foot walk around for [League of Legends](https://www.leagueofbuddies.com/news/buddy-builds-at-pax-east/). We've been nominated for over [22 Emmys](https://www.emmys.com/shows/robot-chicken) and won six of them. We've also won Cleo Awards for our advertising work and have worked with brands from DC, Marvel, Walking Dead, Star Wars, LEGO, Target, and [Denny's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBLThhKIoFM) among many others. All that is to say we know how to translate the spirit of a brand into entertainment. We're also the studio that last year built a life-size walk around goat Noun that made [an appearance at NFT.NYC](https://twitter.com/grelysian/status/1456665812182487048). While our ambition for the next round of life size Nouns is even greater, this experience was amazing, and a source of inspiration for what's to come.\n\nBut we don't want to do this alone. We want to bring the entire Nouns community together to help tell this story. We've been amazed by the early positive support of this proposal and are excited to engage with you all. Nouners will have the opportunity to participate by voting on where these life size \"Nouns in the Wild\" go on their journey, and even participate by walking along with other Nouns in the actual Rose Parade. The documentary will feature interviews with Nounders and Nouners alike, and highlight projects that have been successfully funded and what type of impact they've made. This will be a movie making experience that engages the entire community.\n\n### BENEFITS TO THE NOUNS DAO\n\n\nROSE PARADE\n- HUGE AWARENESS OPPORTUNITY TO TELL THE NOUN STORY\n_(all data below provided by the Tournament of Roses staff)_\n  - Rose Parade seen by 22 million people in the US, and in over 60+ countries across the world\n  - 1,000,000 people line the streets in Pasadena for the parade, and another 150,000 visit the floats pre and post parade\n  - 1.8M+ social impressions\n  - 20 seconds of airtime during telecast with scripted description for Nouns\n  - Inclusion of the float in printed program\n  - Estimated media value of media coverage $300M\n\n\nDOCUMENTARY\n- First documentary about a DAO community to fully tell the Nouns story and cement their place in public imagination, but in a way that's funny and on-brand for both the Nouns and Stoopid Buddy Stoodios.\n- The Nouns community will vote on random acts of joy that our Nouns will spread throughout real world communities as part of our documentary so we can highlight other initiatives the DAO funds and feature other Nounish events.\n- Sequels and other content opportunities to expand on the story we tell in the documentary. Our plan is to take any net proceeds from the sale of the documentary and reinvest them into more Nouns content.\n\n### PHASES OF EXECUTION\n\nPHASE 1: (May-July)\n\n- Select and design the six life-size Nouns\n- Sign contract with the Rose Parade team for 2023\n  - (NOTE: Document each of these phases with our production team)\n- Line up interviews and identity storylines for the documentary (those that would like to remain anonymous will be free to do so)\n- **MILESTONE 1 - Fund 45% of proposed allocation\\***\n\nPHASE 2 (July-September 2022)\n\n- Begin building out the Noun costumes for the documentary and the parade\n- Begin the designs that will ultimately become the massive Rose Parade float\n\nPHASE 3 (August-September)\n\n- Community votes on winning float design\n- Approve the build\n- **MILESTONE 2 - Fund 45% of proposed allocation\\***\n\nPHASE 4 (September 2022-January 2023)\n\n- Film interviews and storylines for the documentary including the \"Nouns in the wild\" segments\n- Film behind the scenes of the parade build and the day of festivities.\n- Release short segments of the film to build awareness and hype for the parade.\n\nPHASE 5 (January-Feb 2023)\n\n- Party at the Rose Parade!\n- Post-Production and editorial cut\n- Screen film exclusively to the Nouns community for feedback on final cut\n- Determine best distribution outlets for the film\n- **MILESTONE 3 - Fund final 10% of proposed allocation\\***\n\nPHASE 6 (Q2/3 2023)\n- Distribution. Our objective is to maximize viewership with wide distribution. Tactics may include submitting to festivals, pitching to streamers and networks (SVOD), or even distributing on AVOD services like YouTube to keep from being behind paywall. We'll make this decision with transparency and will confer with Nouns DAO as we consider options.\n\n_\\* Milestones to be funded at commencement of each phase.

The event is the highest discipline of rallying governed by FIA.*\n\n*Being a native of Kenya, I decided to take into my care a team of 3 drivers both of who have extensive experience and have boasted great results in the rallies they have participated in. Mr Andrew Muiruri, the lead driver, who started his career under the FIA young stars and his co-driver Mr.Edward, one of the most experienced rally drivers in the Southern hemisphere, boasting over 51 podium finishes over a period of over 10 years ,by sponsoring them with 3 stock cars for modification,and to get them registration to be able to participate in the World Rally Championship.*\n\n[![Fia](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/nouns/original/1X/044a29041eb3f76db7e423bd85fc93b1c9823b00.jpeg)](https://www.fia.com/events/world-rally-championship/season-2022/2022-world-rally-championship)\n\n# Proposal\n*I am proposing that my racing team partner with the Nouns in the World Rally Championship Safari Rally that is scheduled for the 24th of June.

The Kenyan leg of the rally garnered 832 million impressions, putting up higher numbers than the Super Bowl and the Champions League. Streaming services such as Red Bull TV and WRC+ will also stream the event live.*\n\n## WRC Rally Car\n*WRC Rally cars are built to the standards stipulated in the FIA WRC Sporting Regulations Handbook. All participating Rally Cars are inspected by FIA, the governing body,to make sure they are up to safety and performance standards to the letter.*\n\n*Like all competition cars, a rally car features a roll cage, upgraded suspension and a strong braking system. In order to pound rough roads at high speeds, however, they require sturdier parts.\nBeefier engine mounts ensure the block won’t shake loose on bumpier road sections, while a thick aluminium skid plate prevents sharp rocks from lacerating an otherwise vulnerable oil pan. Meanwhile, bespoke wheels and tyres are essential for dealing with varied, challenging terrain.*\n\n*Today’s WRC cars are built to the specification set by the international motorsports governing body the FIA.In 2011, rules for WRC cars became more restrictive. Cars were smaller models and exotic materials such as titanium, magnesium and composite were forbidden expect when present in the base model. Initially, gear changes had to be made with a mechanical system, so the use of paddle shifters was not allowed, however this was reversed in 2015.*\n\n*In 2017, manufacturers were given more freedom to maximise aerodynamic performance, while the turbo restrictor diameter was increased from 33 mm to 36 mm, increasing the engine’s power output from 310 bhp to 380 bhp.*\n\n\n## Promotion and Nounified Onsite Clothing & Accessories\n*During the course of the Rally all members of Team Nouns will be donning some form of nounified apparel. The Rally driver’s and their co-drivers, the mechanics and the engineers (Service team) will wear noun safari hats or baseball hats to shield themselves from the scorching African sun.\nThe team will also be supplied with nounified towels to use after completing each leg.

Also, we overall acknowledge that established artists and brands can be afforded a certain baseline of trust to execute on ideas. However, having said that, many Nouncillors expressed concern at the fact that the Proposal included no mockups or design plans, and no Development Phases tied to Milestones. We would like to see, even from established brands, at least some basic mockups to determine whether the designs will be desirable, and/or Nounish. And some Phase Breakdowns, maybe with a design consultation Phase to start, would have made this Proposal more amenable to more Nouncillors (we think.) We're voting FOR, and excited to see the result, but hopefully this feedback is taken to heart by future proposers so that good ideas don't lose votes due to a lack of detail in their on-chain Proposal.

Nerman 1.0 is alive and well!\n\n- Currently running in private server\n- Manually retweeted and shared ~3000 Nounish posts as [NermanBot](https://twitter.com/nermanbot) \n- Curated 4 Twitter lists: [Nouners](https://twitter.com/i/lists/1495232888249491456), [Nouncillors](https://twitter.com/i/lists/1498451834545086470), [Nounish Projects](https://twitter.com/i/lists/1494410570161926147), [Nounish Content Mines](https://twitter.com/i/lists/1473482057246408707)\n\nTo showcase Nerman we released [Lil Nerman](https://twitter.com/LilNerman), a development bot currently running in NIL Discord.\n - will reshare Discord post content to  when :nerman: emoji used\n - has basic commands (/noun and /nouner)\n\nWe have also completed a first version of [Noun O'Clock bot](https://nounoclock.wtf/) that anyone can add. It is currently running in NIL and NounsDAO Japan.\n - shows time to Noun O'Clock in bot status\n - posts link to [FOMONouns.wtf](https://fomonouns.wtf) at Noun O'Clock \n\n___\n\n# 2. DISCORD BOT - NERMAN\n\n___\n\nThe Nerman Discord bot can help with internal governance and polling, sharing community news to the world, connecting people, lending a hand. A true friend.\n\n**2. A.) DISCORD - SIMPLE VOTING**\n\nNouncil / subdaos all use emoji polls to vote on Nouns DAO proposals. It's messy and a lot of work. Nerman can fix this.\n\n**Problems - Discord Emoji Polls**\n - people can vote for more than one option\n - if emoji votes are public, anybody can add reactions. Because of this you have to manually go through and manually tally results.\n - people can add unwanted emojis, cluttering the poll.\n - when the vote is finished you have to manually mark it closed and post the results.\n - the results aren't stored in a database, and there are no broad statistics calculated from them\n\n**Simple Voting - Features**\n\n - allow / disallow voting based on Discord roles (public, Nouner, Nouncillor...)\n - votes can be anonymous, or public. For anon votes participation will still be tracked but actual vote content won't be stored\n - can enforce one vote per user, or allow multiple\n - specify an end time\n - live visual feedback, which can be turned on or off\n - uses Discords new button API\n - stores votes in a database in preparation for future web apps that display voting stats\n - basic API for db queries so others can build with this data\n\n**FUTURE GOALS**\n - consider further voting methods: weighted voting, ranked choice, quadratic. Can any reliably be done from Discord?\n - manage and deploy votes from web app\n - create Snapshot vote and post to Discord\n - possibly automate executing Nouns DAO vote\n\n___\n\n**2. B.) DISCORD - SOCIAL SHARING**\n___\n\nNounish Discords are contain a stream of Nounish content, creators put their soul into noggley creations and the world needs to see it. Nerman can fix this.\n\nIn V1.0 we implemented basic social sharing, active in the NIL Discord and the [@LilNerman](https://twitter.com/lilnerman) account. \n\n**FEATURES - COMPLETED**\n - user reacts \"Nerman\" emoji, Nerman responds with \"NERMAN_BLAST\" \n - text & media (image, gif, video) are formatted appropriately for twitter\n - threshold function that determines how many votes needed to share\n\n**FEATURES - NEW**\n - better media handling, adding support for large videos and any other misc media that needs to be formatted and handled for Twitter\n - create Nerman social media accounts on other platforms (instagram, Facebook, LinkedIn). Format it appropriately and post it there as well\n - test thoroughly and improve error handling and messages\n - if user's post is just a tweet, allow Nerman to simply retweet\n - further develop Twitter thread functionality for long text posts\n - test the Threshold functionality with live public, tweak and dial in\n - experiment with Threshold calculations in an active Discord\n\n\n___\n\n **2. C.) DISCORD - COMMANDS**\n___\n\nSome people live in Discord.They live and breath Discord. They don't want to go on the *internet* to find Nounish facts and assets, they want it In-The-Chat. Nerman can... ah, whatever, you get it.\n\nV1.0 Nerman implemented the following commands using https://noun.pics\n\n**/noun [id]**\nReturned a PNG of the specified Noun in an ephemeral response.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/HZ4GiRE.png)\n\n\n**/nouner [address or ENS]**\nReturned a grid showing the Nouns owned by that address.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/vXxFXUs.png)\n\n\n**FEATURES - NEW**\nWe will switch to the Nouns DAO subgraph and offer more details.\n\n - /nerman noun [id]\nCan display a more detailed ephemeral message about the Noun. It could possibly include: a PNG image, the last sale price, current owner, basic DAO voting stats, other Nouns owned... we will try to express the most useful content in a minimal clean way.\n\n- /nerman nouner [address or ETH address] [include delegates]\nWe will change this to an ephemeral with more stats about that address, including owned Nouns and delegated Nouns. Possibly things like auctions won, etc.\n\n- Other Useful General commands\nWe’d like to add further useful commands as we think of them, while also not clogging up the Nouns command space. We will experiment!\n\n\n---\n\n  **2 D.) DISCORD - BOT MESSAGES**\n\n---\n\nNerman will be active in the Discord posting useful things about the State of Nouns, social media, and anything else he can chime in on.\n\n**FEATURES**\n\n - When a new Nouner !joins Nerman will provide a welcome package with all links and instructions required to enjoy their Nouns experience.\n - When someone wins an auction Nerman will look on ENS for connected Social Media accounts and try to tag them with a Warm Welcome when possible\n - All State of Nouns events will be available with nice formatting: new auction, bids, auction end, new DAO proposal, proposal executed, etc\n - Notifications whenever a Noun is transferred - if it occurs on a marketplace with an API (OpenSea, LooksRare, Zora) we will provide appropriate metadata like price\n - These notifications will be configurable - work with the commmunity to figure out which ones are useful, turn the rest off\n - top daily Twitter messages\n\n---\n\n  **2. E.) DISCORD - ADMIN CONFIG**\n\n---\n\nIn the beginning Nerman will only be allowed in approved Discords under the devs watchful eyes. We will tweak, and improve, and help Nerman be the best bot he can be.\n\nOnce Nerman is a well built, reliable bot, we will build out a simple config system for people to install and configure Nerman to run in any Discord and share to any social media accounts. \n\n**FEATURES**\n - configure which \"State of Nouns\" events post, and to which channel\n - configure which social media accounts Nerman posts too, including posting to your orgs own social media\n - where Nerman listens for posts to share to social media\n - turn options on and off (swear filter, welcome committee, etc)\n - customize messages things like the Noun O'Clock message\n - change language\n\n---\n\n  # 3. DISCORD BOT - NOUN O'CLOCK\n\n---\n\nNoun O'Clock bot is a very basic fork of Nerman that does two simple things:\n\n - Counts down to the next Noun O'Clock in the bot status:\n![](https://i.imgur.com/w7F9c0O.png)\n - At Noun O'Clock - posts a link to [FOMO Nouns](https://fomonouns.wtf/) in the designated channel:\n![](https://i.imgur.com/a0GLIjP.png)\n\nThis is currently running in several discords, including NounsDAO Japan and NIL. You can download and install the current version of Noun O'Clock here: https://nounoclock.wtf/\n\n**NEW FEATURES**\n - Integrate new State of Nouns libray\n - Add more details to announcement link, including an image of the sold Noun, sale price, and buyer address.\n\n\n---\n\n# 4. TWITTER BOT - NERMAN LISTENER\n\n___\n\nNerman surfs through social media (Twitter, LinkedIn, Instawhatever, etc), sharing, caring, looking for primo Nounish content to showcase. He is on a mission to automate his Twitter account. Nerman will try to figure out novel ways to find high quality Nounish content and decide which ones should be shared to [@NermanBot](https://twitter.com/nermanbot). This will take some experimentation, we have ideas but will be trying them out and continuously refining.\n\n\n**FEATURES**\n - Nerman will listen on Twitter @NermanBot tags. In the beginning he will retweet all of them, and when there are too many, will develop further metrics for choosing what to Tweet.\n - Nerman will listen for common Nounish content, like \"@nounsdao\", \"#nouns\", and \"⌐◨-◨\" and share the top results.\n - Nerman will share important events from the State of Nouns, including saying hello to New Nouners when an auction finishes, \n - Nerman will compare content from all methods and ensure only a reasonable amount of tweets are sent each day.\n - broadcast Nerman activity to additional social networks: Instagram, Facebook, LinkedIn\n\nIf the DAO desires Nerman can eventually post directly to [@NounsDao](https://twitter.com/nounsdao).\n\n\n___\n\n# 5. WEBSITE - NERMAN.WTF\n\n___\n\nNerman will maintain a presence in the *old web* at https://nerman.wtf. There will be some fun, basic info about Nouns DAO, a guide to following Nerman and Nouns activity, and a web app that displays voting stats from Discord polls.\n\n**FEATURES**\n\n - a summary of Nerman and Nerman's activities\n - discord bot documentation\n - State of Nouns documentation\n - instructions on how to engage with Nerman on Twitter\n - links to all Nerman social media\n - breakdown of vote results and decisions made\n - breakdown of behaviour across all votes, including user behavior (if not anon) \n\n___\n\n# 6. WEBSITE - NOUNOCLOCK.WTF\n\n---\nNerman will maintain a very basic site for Noun O'Clock. It's already complete. \n[https://nounoclock.wtf/](https://)\n\n**FEATURES**\n - a website with stuff on it. Go look\n\n___\n\n# 7. JS LIBRARY - STATE OF NOUNS\n\n---\n\nWHEN DO THINGS HAPPEN?! Nerman needs to know, and so do other Nounish bots. When a Nouns auction ends, when a proposal is created, when a Noun sells on OpenSea. Nerman needs these events, and the data associated with them.\n\nState of Nouns is a standalone JS library for the Nounish community. Nerman will use it, and any other JS project can use it to accurately get events from all Nouns DAO activity.\n\nOur first priority is developing this fully for Nerman. Afterwards we will package and release it as an open source, free standalone library.\n\n\n**FEATURES**\n - provides access to all Nouns events across governance, NFTs, etc\n - will report all Noun transfers. Will report sale metadata if on OpenSea, LooksRare, or Zora\n - simple JS library that can be incorporated into other projects\n - user provides own Web3 connection details (supports various JSON-RPC options)\n - no centralized service, simply fork the code and run your own\n\n\n---\n\n# 8. USER ROLES & META DATA RESEARCH\n\n---\n\nDiscord user roles are often verified with Collab.Land. Nerman will be able to function with existing User roles. \n\nWe will experiment with other options in a separate Discord, try to find a better way. We have specific advanced Nerman functionality we want to explore. There are solutions like [The Guild](https://www.the-guild.dev/) and devcarrot's [custom idea](https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/lets-build-a-better-way-to-verify-ownership/297). A simple connection to ENS would also be great.\n\n**FUNCTIONALITY RESEARCH GOALS**\n - connect Discord username -> wallet address -> Twitter username so we can correctly tag users on Twitter when sharing. This could be a custom app, or there might be existing tools we can use.\n - NOUNS: automating \"[Nouner](https://twitter.com/i/lists/1495232888249491456)\" Twitter list to automatically add new Nouners, and remove Nouners who sell their Noun\n - if people have ENS with twitter and Discord usernames added we can tag people live as the Nouns auction bids happen, and we could send winners nice welcome messages on Twitter and Discord.\n - We will publish our findings as a guide for other communities to follow\n\n\n___\n\n# 9. RECURRING COSTS\n\n___\n\n**HOSTING & MAINTENANCE**\n___\n**Discord Bots**\nNerman\nNoun O'Clock Bot\n\n**Twitter Bots**\nNerman Listener\n\n**Websites**\nNerman.wtf\nNounOClock.wtf\n\n**Code Libraries**\nState Of Nouns JS\n\nAll of these will need to be hosted and maintained over time. We will be in Discord and on Twitter paying attention to quality and listening to the community. We will publish the State of Nouns library on something like NPM, ensure it's accessible to devs, and answer questions from the community.\n\n___\n\n**SOCIAL MEDIA MANAGEMENT**\n___\n\nNerman has been active since January: https://twitter.com/NermanBot/\n\nThe account has been operated manually by Joel Cares for about 5 months now (almost 3000 RTs!) and involves scouring Twitter for content daily. We will continue this for 6 more months, until Nerman is ready to automate the content curation and take over the reigns.\n\nOnce Nerman Bot is live, we will still loosely moderate the feed to ensure quality is kept high and nothing Vile comes through. As the algorithms are tweaked to perfection this moderation will no longer be needed.\n\n**FEATURES**\n - Constant content moderation to ensure quality\n - Manual curation of [Nounish Content Lists](https://twitter.com/NermanBot/lists) until they can be automated\n\n___\n\n# 10. PRIORITY USE CASES\n\n___\n\nOnce Nerman is live these are our top priority use cases:\n\n - NOUNS: #nouncil-vote\n   - a channel where only Nerman can post\n   - votes are automatically created for every new DAO proposal\n   - Nouncillors can also create votes through /nerman vote command\n   - Nouncillor role has 1 vote per user\n   - votes last 60 hours, after which they close and display results\n   - Nouncillor manually process Gnosis Safe vote\n   - simple stats to help ensure Nouncillors are participating\n\n - NOUNS: #nouner-poll\n   - only Nerman can post\n   - Nouners can create polls through /nerman command\n   - Nouners have 1 vote per Noun\n   - Votes have 72 hour period.\n   - used for informal consensus gathering only. Used to gauge Nouner opinions, help choose between options when writing proposals, judge contests... Quick and semi-fair off-chain feedback from the Discord Nouner hive-mind.\n\n - TWITTER: [@NermanBot](https://twitter.com/nermanbot)\n     - automate content curation\n\n___\n\n# 11.

The final on-chain proposal is front-loaded with an easily digested paragraph outlining Deliverables, Timeline, Budget, and then the detailed proposal that follows explains exactly what the DAO will be getting for its ETH. We are looking forward to all the challenges Nerman Bot will be able to help solve within Nouns DAO discord (including several applications for Nouncil), as well as the other websites and bots that Joel’s team will build to help proliferate the meme.

Fund installation of Nouns glasses VISIBLE FROM EARTH ORBIT\n2. Serve as venue retainer for future Nouns IRL events\n3. Establish Nouns DAO as a founding supporter of charity beer garden that will utilize the space\n4. Provide drone photography of finished project and initiate media coverage\n\n**Benefits:**\n1. Imprint Nouns upon the permanent record via Google Earth, Google Maps, etc.\n2. Retain two venues for IRL Nouns events in the US Midwest\n3. Reinforce the Nouns ethos by supporting a community-oriented charity event series\n4. Raise Nouns awareness and proliferation potential on a previously unrealized scale\n\n![Event Space](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/nouns/original/2X/0/0d7ffadc9ee9fe961e06d937ecc2a31cf2273d46.jpeg \"Event Space\")\n\nThe DAO has already funded a Nouns expedition space and the ISS. This proposal will MAKE NOUNS VISIBLE FROM SPACE by installing a pair of Nouns glasses large enough that they’ll be seen from orbit and for long enough to be included when satellite maps are updated in Google Earth/Maps, etc. They’ll become part of the permanent record, visible even to normies that don’t frequent NFT social media. The glasses will appear less\nthan 300 yards from the largest stadium in the US (third largest in the world) and one of the largest universities — a destination for hundreds of thousands every year. It’s also an area that has undergone major municipal and private development over the past 12 months so updates to online maps are sure to follow.\n\nNouns funding will fulfill multiple goals simultaneously: the biggest and most visible being the massive Nouns glasses, obvious not only to online navigators but to in-person visitors and media providing ground & aerial coverage during sporting events. The glasses will be included as part of a synthetic turf upgrade at the site and will align with a North-oriented map display for a natural viewing angle. Replacing the natural lawn with\nsynthetic turf will improve durability at the site and preserve the Nouns glasses long enough for the next satellite maps update to take place.\n\nFunding will also serve as a retainer for Nouns IRL events in a Midwest US city accustomed to large gatherings and a short drive from an international air hub. The Nouns community is welcome at the charity beer garden and can also request a private visit. Nouns DAO will have access to a 10,000 square foot outdoor site and a\npremium residential venue for any dates not reserved for charity events).\n\nInstallation of the Nouns glasses at the site will identify Nouns DAO as an advocate for community-oriented events in public spaces and will benefit a well-established charity beer garden that began at this location in 2016. The family-friendly public tailgate successfully attracted tens of thousands of patrons each season (before a pandemic hiatus) and grossed six figures for cancer programming.\n\nA licensed drone photographer will capture photos of the Nouns glasses in situ so that images and Nouns backstory may be included in a press release for local and national media. The owner/manager of the charity event spent 26 years as a professional photographer and has numerous media and connections, including a spouse in the publishing and PR industry.","proposer":"0xf8A065F287d91d77cD626AF38ffA220D9B552A2b","startBlock":14807625,"endBlock":14827335,"executed":false},"votes":[{"support":1,"voter":"0xf8A065F287d91d77cD626AF38ffA220D9B552A2b","numberOfVotes":2,"reason":"Nouns from space, a space to play, thats a yes from me.

I'm voting AGAINST since I'm opposed to sending a signal to present and future nouns extensions that we value receiving NFT supply allocation in a special way.\n\nReceiving someone else's NFTs is kind of a headache. We're suddenly put into the position of having to make asset owner decisions (should we hold or sell) and in some cases such as this one we might have added governance responsibilities as well (e.g. have 10% responsibility of lil nouns' future). So unless we have some easy DAO level consensus on regularly selling the newly received NFTs, we're likely looking at the duties of holding onto an illiquid asset while incurring more DAO governance overhead. One might say that if we start receiving a lot of NFTs this way then some might really pop and have liquid markets and we might be able to experience some real ETH treasury gains through it. But if we really believed in that then we could have always bought new noun extension NFTs as pure investors with our ETH. I believe we have yet to do that because we don't think ourselves as NFT investors (even if the scope is limited to nouns extensions) and don't think that is where we create the most value from our attention. \n\nAn arrangement that we'd much rather prefer than being gifted NFT supply is a nouns extension buying Nouns with their treasury. In this arrangement, we get ETH and likely some governance participation as well, both things that we really like and no added responsibilities that we don't like. \n\nI'm not saying that we should be stingy or completely self centered in a short term way. I think Lil Nouns is a brilliant experiment and love that we're for example spinning up a lil nouns prop house and sending ETH their way to help bootstrap builders there, etc. I just think that rewarding NFT supply gifting over other acts such as buying nouns or participating in our governance (which both sharkdao and goop have done) sends the wrong message that is against our incentives.

I’ve been making Nouns-inspired art like my [Myth of Noun collection on Superrare](https://superrare.com/series/0xca4607aad52f654cf6357895c397094c077a3236) and my [Nouns at Work collection on Foundation ](https://foundation.app/collection/nounsatwork).\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/N70U3r8.jpg)\n\n*The Myth of Noun & Nouns at Work collections*\n\nI am an artist with over fifteen years of experience in children’s entertainment via animation and publishing. I’m writing this proposal because I think the world needs a Nouns children’s book - and I’d like to make one.\n\n**Goals**\nIntroduce the fun, positive energy of Nouns to a young audience (and their parents). Create a wonderful nounish illustrated experience in physical form. Open a path to the traditional publishing world for Nouns.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/biSbsDm.jpg)\n\n**I am a Noun**\n\nI am a Noun (tentative title) will be an illustrated book for young children where we meet, learn about, laugh with, laugh at, argue with, understand, admire and ultimately love the Nouns. It will read like a curious journey with occasional reader involvement instead of a traditional linear story. For those familiar with children’s books, think along the lines of Julie Morstad’s Today, Oliver Jeffer’s Here We Are, or Richard Scarry’s Best Word Book Ever - these books take a big idea and explore them visually and nonlinearly.\n\nThe book may start with asking a simple question to the reader: What is a noun? Our Nouns characters will have their opinions on this, which will lead to more questions, and more opinions - often at odds with each other and the narrator, with the reader stuck in the middle of it all. The book will be curious, funny, smart, absurd, and nounish… always. And it might end with another question for the reader: What kind of noun will you be?\n\nYou already have an idea of what it might look like. I don’t see the book as fully painted as my Myth of Noun pieces - probably more minimal like Nouns at Work with characters on simple backgrounds. And like the art I’ve done, I will base as much as possible on official Nouns traits. I’ll also be adding new characters (people, places, things…) and will put the Nouns glasses on almost everything.\n\nIt should be noted that the story will not directly reference the dao, nfts, crypto, ect. I would consider this project a very gentle trojan horse for nouns for a brand new audience.\n\nI will also encourage and welcome any input from the Nounders as I develop this story to keep the nounish vibes in check. ⌐◨-◨\n\n**Package**\n\nThis is not funding for a finished book, but rather funding for the development of a book submission package. Once a successful submission and sale takes place, the publisher would acquire publishing rights and offer an advance so that I may finish the rest of the book.\n\nI have literary representation (Emily Van Beek at Folio Jr. literary agency) who has already shown interest and encouraged me to pursue this idea. I will work with her to fine tune this submission and once we’re both confident that it’s ready, she will work on my behalf to find a publisher for it.\n\nI’d like funding from the DAO so I can devote time to write, illustrate and develop this idea into a package that would include:\n\n* A finished manuscript\n* A book ‘dummy’ (a sketched out layout of the full book)\n* 2-3 pages of finished art\n* Cover art\n\nThis amount of material makes up a strong package which solidifies all the main creative decisions (the concept, the story, the content and flow of the pages, and the final art style) for a confident submission.\n\nThe goal would be to have material ready to submit to publishers in fall 2022.\n\n**Funds Requested**\n\n15 ETH\n\n**Caveats**\n\n* There is a small possibility that the normy publishing world may struggle to support a project based on a nft collection, or using a public domain ‘brand’, or because we just don’t get it all those weird heads. I don’t believe any of these things will happen because A) I believe I can create a wonderful, unique book that publishers will want, and B) I love the Nouns, and I believe many others will too.\n* I’ll be relying on my agent for her experience and advice with regard to submitting, and any and all publishers, from the big 5 to smaller indie publishers may be considered. In the event that a traditional publishing deal proves difficult, self-publishing could be another option, in which case I would return to the DAO to explore further funding for production and distribution with a separate proposal.\n* The DAO should anticipate that any book published with a traditional publisher will most likely end up in a more traditional copyright situation and not CC0.\n\n**TL;DR** - I’m asking for 15 ETH to develop a robust submission package for a Nouns children’s book for traditional publishing.\n\n**About Me**\nI’ve worked for over 15 years in animation as an art director, director and creative director at Guru Studio on a range of hit animated series including Paw Patrol, True and the Rainbow Kingdom, Pikwik Pack, and Mecha Builders. I’m also the creator of my own series, the Emmy-nominated Justin Time.\n\nI’m the illustrator of I Was Born a Baby and I Live in a Tree Trunk with Harper Collins, A Bear, a Bee, and a Honey Tree with Astra Publishing/Hippo Park, Cow Says Meow with HMH, Snow Falls with Penguin Random House/Tundra Books, and The Dog Who Wanted to Fly with Annick Press.

Nouners. And Nounish Friends.\n\nAs Nouns continues to strive to be a household name throughout the world, our team began to think, let us not lose our tie to our everyday life. We are not necessarily here to use our digital space as a means to escape the real world, but rather, as a means to improve it. An ethos and belief that we know many Nouners also feel.\n\nWith this in mind and our team’s love and experience in the international coffee industry, we come to the DAO and the Nouns Community with a proposal for Nouns Coffee, the first ever Nounish consumable brand. With hopes of being on the shelves of your favorite cafe, local market, or frequented grocery store. With the potential of someday having special real world locations at the corner of your favorite neighborhood to meet up and sip a cup with some of your closest nounish friends.\n\n### Nouns Coffee Brand\n*Below you will find key details on how our team plans to bring this prolific coffee brand to life.*\n\n## Phase One\n### Coffee\n\n- For Phase One of Nouns Coffee, the team will be sourcing a high-quality roaster in order to whitelabel for the brand. (read more about the potential plans for phase 2 and 3 later in this proposal)\n- Our team will use their connections within the coffee industry to find the right partner to roast our coffee. We will work diligently to ensure the highest quality coffee. This includes virtually hosted cupping sessions where we will send the roasts around to members of the community so we can all decide on the roasts together.\n- All coffee will be fair trade and organic. We care deeply about not only who drinks our coffee, but the hands that were instrumental in the planting, growing, harvesting, and roasting of our coffee.\n- Phase One will include a variety of different single origins as well as a variety of blends so that all of our nounish palettes are satisfied and caffeinated (and decaffeinated for you weirdos).\n\n### Ecommerce\n\n- In order to get Nouns Coffee into as many cups as possible, we will build an ecommerce site in order to streamline operations and provide trustworthy purchasing and shipping of Nouns Coffee.\n- This will be inclusive of a custom web experience reflective of the existing Nouns brand, to ensure a cohesive experience.\nWe will most likely use Shopify along with an integration of Coinbase Commerce in order to accept payments in crypto as well.\n- The team will work on Web3 integration to enable all Nounders and Nouners to access and claim certain coffees/roasts for free as part of their participation in the DAO.\n\n### Collateral/Advertising\n\n- Beyond just caffeinating you, we will provide you with vessels to sip from as you listen to hosted noun o’clock spaces by CDT, while at work, or out for your morning walk.\nWe will create custom cards to place in each order with QR codes (or similar) sending people to nouns.wtf so they can check out the daily auction while brewing their morning coffee.\n- Phase One will also include the creation of other nounish collateral like tote bags to carry around your coffee, your mug, your books, your HW, you name it. We’ll work with the community to decide what pieces of collateral will be best used to show off your love for the community and your love for coffee. Proliferation is the name of the game.\n\n### By Nouns for Nouns\n\n- Being a Nounder/Nouner will open the door for monthly perks from Nouns Coffee. This may come in the form of monthly coffee deliveries, custom mugs and totes, and even “Noun of the Month” featured roasts where Nouners can have their Nouns featured on the packaging etc.\n- Beyond being a Nounder or a Nouner, if you hold a Nouns Bidder POAP (brkfstsndwch’s first project for the DAO), you will also have the chance for added features and perks from Nouns Coffee.\n\n### (If prop is approved by June 9th) Soft Launch at Korea Blockchain Week 2022 in August\n\n- In collaboration with alphanonce, holders of Noun 75, we will be the Coffee Break Sponsers of Korea Blockchain Week in 2022.\n- Being the Coffee Break Sponsors of the event means:\n- Possibly the greatest branding exposure at KBW2022 as attendees are\nconstantly searching for their next cup of coffee. Branding will include\nfull-colored signage at all coffee stations, and on branded napkins and\ncoffee sleeves.\n- Thousands of eyes, and mouths, witnessing the glory of Nouns and Nouns Coffee.\n\n### Project Timeline\n#### Phase One Accelerated for Korea Blockchain Week\nFull Timeline Can Be Viewed [Here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1G1l5sQb3JRQ5C0NGSklu_KoSe4p0KWk_/view)\n*Branding and Coffee Ready for KBW | 8-10 Weeks from Approval of Proposal*\n\n#### Phase One (if not approved by June 9th)\n4-8 Weeks | Roaster Sourcing for Whitelabel\n4-8 Weeks | Brand Identity\n6-8 Weeks | Packaging Design\n4-6 Weeks | Packaging Production\n6-8 Weeks | Collateral Design\n6-8 Weeks | Collateral Production\n6-8 Weeks | Website Design + Development\n2-4 Weeks | Coffee Production (begins after roaster is sourced)\n*Site is Live and First Bags Shipped | 12-18 Weeks from Approval of Proposal*\n\n## Phase Two\n*Sourcing/Roastery | Warehouse Leasing and Hiring Head Roaster*\n- Upon the successful adoption of Phase One and dependent on the demand for more coffee, we will submit a second proposal to lease our own warehouse and roaster, while also hiring a head roaster to roast and produce our own coffee.\n- The pros to this are the eventuality of bringing down costs, allowing us to keep our quality high, and giving us the opportunity to produce at scale.\n- A successful Phase Two will also set us up with a better position to execute on Phase Three (read below).\n- More details will of course be shared with the Nouns Community throughout Phase One as we begin thinking towards a Phase Two.\n\n## Phase Three\n*Nouns Cafe*\n- A real world cafe, bringing the meme to life. Imagine you are walking down the cobblestone streets of soho and you look to your right to see a bright red figure appear, to realize it’s a pair of noggles.

Each unique poster design will be posted in a grid of 8 (all 8 posters will be the same artwork), with different designs being posted in their own grid of 8 across different locations, creating a scavenger like hunt to collect all 8 artworks.\n\nEach poster will have a QR code that will allow individuals to mint 1 of 150 limited editions of each artwork. There will be 1,200 total mints at a price of 0.15 ETH each. All primary and secondary sales will go to the Vector DAO treasury to be used to purchase a Noun, replenishing the Nouns treasury. Any remaining ETH post Nouns acquisition will be split among the artists and team. As a stretch goal, we will try to support having the first 25 mints of each artwork be free, allowing this drop to be accessible to more people – this will depend on our ability to find an elegant sybil resistant solution in time.\n\nVector will provide photographers to take photos of all the posters to share on social to boost visibility (blurring out the QR code) as well as write an article about our collaboration experience with Nouns DAO to help future creators make proposals.\n\n![N|Solid](https://i.imgur.com/HB7iq5Y.png)\n\n## What’s in it for Nouns DAO?\n### Spread the Nouns meme\n- We're putting up 200 giant posters (6ft tall) around NYC during a high visibility week + taking photos to share online\n- The artwork will be done by a roster of top tier artists with their own audience and community\n- There's a fun game attached to being the first to find the posters and mint the limited NFTs, creating a viral loop to share back online\n- Vector DAO will use proceeds from the mint to purchase a Noun, forming a long term relationship between Vector and Nouns, helping replenish the treasury, and cementing the culture of paying it forward to more nounish builders\n\n### Pave a path for more creatives to contribute to Nouns\n- We'll bring 8 really amazing artists into the Nouns universe, who will then talk about it with their friends, driving more high caliber builders to the Nouns universe\n- This also forms a relationship with Vector DAO, a community of 80 super strong makers who are excited to further contribute to nouns\n- We'll write an article about the entire process to help onboard more makers into the community\n\n## The Artists\n[Shawna X](https://shawna-x.com) | New Yorker, Academy Awards, Nike, Google\n[Elijah Anderson](https://www.instagram.com/spacehose/) | Adidas, SNS / New Balance, Popeye’s\n[Lulu Lin](https://www.instagram.com/da__h_/) | Adobe, MAYDAY Magazine, Migrant Journal \n[Adam Ho](https://www.adamho.com/) | Cash App, Beat Foundry, Airbnb, Nike\n[Danny Jones](https://yasly.com/) | Grammy’s, Nike, New Balance\n[Haruko Hayakawa](https://www.haruko.co/) | New York Times, Bon Appetit, Fly by Jing\n[Moon Collective](https://www.instagram.com/mooncollective/) | Saturdays NYC, Instagram, Popi CBD\n_And more (pending proposal approval)_\n\n## The concept: Independent, together\n![N|Solid](https://i.imgur.com/bYQ8hIH.jpg)\n_(Similar concept for Art Basel in 2021)_\n\nWe’re commissioning 8 artists with distinct styles to create a series of posters remixing Nouns, showcasing each artist’s unique styles and perspectives (illustration, 3D, typography, color, etc). To create a consistent visual motif across the posters, the artwork must feature a Nouns artifact, but interpreted however the artist sees fit. Vector will have these artworks printed on 200+ wheatpaste posters and posted around the NFT NYC conference in Times Square and in neighborhoods like Williamsburg and SoHo.\n\nEach poster will have a QR code where viewers can mint 1 of 150 limited edition NFTs of that poster’s artwork. Each NFT edition will have a mint price of 0.15 ETH and be sold using the [Zora Protocol](https://create.zora.co/).\n\nWe hope the end product not only propagates the Nouns brand and reflects the power of placing goods in the public domain, but also the power of individuals in forming digital communities like Vector to create across both digital and physical mediums.\n\n## About Vector DAO\nVector DAO is a collective of artists, designers, and developers in web3. Our mission is to give individuals autonomy over all aspects of their work from lifestyle and creative freedom to team and compensation. We believe in a future where creatives and makers aren’t tied to any one employer but can freely contribute to communities, like Nouns, that excites them. We believe in the power of working independently, together. That means members run their own independent practices but share resources, risks, and opportunities as a community, working together in groups when projects call for it, or individually at other times. Over time, Vector hopes to prove this new model of working that other communities and builders can replicate, sustainably working for public goods and moving web3 forward.\n\n## Budget\n200 Wheatpaste posters in Times square, Williamsburg, SoHo [1]: **20 ETH ($36,000)**\n8 Independent artists’ commission [2]: **100 ETH ($180,000)**\nNFT mint mini-site design & dev [2]: **10 ETH ($18,000)**\nContribution process blog post w/ photos [2]: **0 ETH**\nTotal: **130 ETH**\n\n_[1] Vendor: TBD, evaluating several proposals_\n_[2] Vendor: Vector DAO Community_\n\n\n## Timeline\n**June 6, 2022** Artwork finished and sent to printers\n**June 20, 2022** Wheatpaste posters printed and posted around NYC\n**June 24, 2022** NFT minting closed\n\n## Artist work sample\n![N|Solid](https://i.imgur.com/d11dgfR.png)\n_Shawna X (http://shawna-x.com/, https://twitter.com/shawnax, https://www.instagram.com/shawnax/)_\n\n![N|Solid](https://i.imgur.com/E5h0QiU.png)\n_Danny Jones (https://yasly.com/, https://foundation.app/@yasly, https://twitter.com/yasly)_\n\n![N|Solid](https://i.imgur.com/Hc9nMJq.png)\n_Adam Ho (https://www.adamho.com/, https://twitter.com/omgadamho, https://foundation.app/@adam)_\n\n![N|Solid](https://i.imgur.com/KGVtNIO.png)\n_Elijah Anderson (https://www.instagram.com/spacehose)_\n\n![N|Solid](https://i.imgur.com/1Gazydq.png)\n_Moon Collective (moon-collective.com, www.instagram.com/mooncollective)_\n\n![N|Solid](https://i.imgur.com/8DbrpCv.png)\n_Lulu Lin (https://www.instagram.com/da__h_/, https://super-noodle.com/, https://www.itsnicethat.com/articles/lulu-lin-illustration-050319)_\n\n![N|Solid](https://i.imgur.com/WtWop9N.png)\n_Haruko Hayakawa (https://www.haruko.co/, https://www.instagram.com/harukohayakawa/, https://foundation.app/@haruko/)_\n\n","proposer":"0xA86882277E69FbF0a51805cdc8b0a3a113079E63","startBlock":14882359,"endBlock":14902069,"executed":true},"votes":[{"support":1,"voter":"0xC3598d91844B061195136600AD243b077Cc164e2","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0xA86882277E69FbF0a51805cdc8b0a3a113079E63","numberOfVotes":2,"reason":"Excited for art and dao2dao prop"},{"support":1,"voter":"0xDb94Daa8bF1b6F45B122F442F922a2C4DD2F7aDe","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":"If executed properly (which it seems like this team can do), this should be a great way to bring multiple different artist communities into the fold of nouns.

This activation will take place during NFT NYC (June 20 – 23) and will feature:\n- Hand painted mural by Jasper Wong who is an artist and founder of Worldwide Walls (http://www.powwowworldwide.com/ 3), the mural will be viewable from June 20 – July 10 and will promote NFT culture by highlighting several well known projects with Nouns at the center.\n- Simple website / landing page to commemorate the mural\n\n**The activation is estimated to generate ~2.5M impressions. The total amount being requested is 87.5 ETH.**\n\n## Why Should You Care? \nWe can all agree that art is a pretty powerful communicator; it appeals to our emotions, forces us to think, and does a pretty good job of bringing us together on some level. We hope to use this power to accomplish the following: \n- Increase awareness of Nouns at NFT NYC—online and IRL\n- Increase brand awareness of the Nouns DAO as a leader in the industry;\n- Invite NFT enthusiasts and the public at large to become involved with the Nouns DAO community. We want to let people know that we are here and we invite them to come build the future with us; and,\n- Create a website (nounsirl.live) that tells the story behind the art (plan is to also include art from other cities on the tour)\n  - High-res images and time lapse video of the mural, artist’s explanation etc.\n  - Links to Nouns website, twitter, discord, etc.  \n\n## Nouns IRL — Person, Place, Thing\nNouns: person, place, thing… We thought that it would be really cool to bring this concept to IRL via fun and engaging art activations around the world. Each stop on the tour will feature a specific artist (or group of artists), a city, and an interesting Nounified art piece. Imagine Nouns on Venice Beach, or Nouns on a rehabilitated basketball court in Chicago. Imagine the looks on people’s faces if a huge inflated Noun floated by them in Miami. These art activations will vary in flight time from several weeks to several months, with the goal being to create longer lasting pieces that become a part of the cultural backdrop in the city. There are a ton of things we can explore on this tour and we think NFT NYC would be a perfect place to start. \n\n## Person\nJasper Wong, founder of [Worldwide Walls](https://www.instagram.com/powwowworldwide/?hl=en).\n\nJasper Wong is an artist, illustrator, curator and art director; his art style can be described as a unique clash of Asian-influenced pop culture on paper. Jasper has exhibited worldwide in places such as Japan, California, France, London, Mexico, New York, Hong Kong, Chicago, and Australia. Jasper is also extremely accomplished having been chosen as one of the HB100, a list of Hypebeast’s 100 most influential figures in the industry, which includes the likes of Kaws, Pharrell, Banksy, Jay Z and Kanye West.\n\nJasper is a big fan of Nouns, he has been following the project for some time and is very excited at the opportunity to get involved with the DAO. In addition to painting the mural, Jasper will be sending out Nouns-related messages on his social media platforms to engage his followers before and during the mural’s flight time. Jasper is also very well known within the art community and will attempt to leverage his network to invite some of his artist friends to hang out with him at the completed mural during NFT NYC. The goal will be to use both Jasper and his artist friends’ followers to generate additional traffic at the mural and further amplify social media impressions.\n\nJasper is very involved with the community through his non-profit organisation Pow! Wow! of which he is the creator and lead director. Pow! Wow! is a group of contemporary artists committed to community enrichment through the creation of art outreach programs, educational programs, and engaging the community in the creation and appreciation of art. Pow! Wow! has executed projects (murals, school renovations, basketball courts, etc.) in 13 cities around the globe, such as Honolulu, Taipei, Tokyo, Nepal, Guam, Seoul, Israel, and others. \n\n![N|Solid](https://i.imgur.com/Gd2UFLO.jpg)\n_(Jasper Wong)_\n\n## Place\nNew York City during NFT NYC, the Super Bowl of NFT conferences.\n\nNFT NYC is the perfect staging ground for the first Nouns IRL activation. One of the stated missions of the DAO is to attract builders/creatives who are ready to create products that proliferate the Nouns brand to a wider audience and shed positive light on the concept of DAOs. NFT/crypto enthusiasts attending NFT NYC are a perfect target for this mission as many are informed about the space and are also builders/creatives looking for a project to support. The general public present in New York at this time will be surrounded by a ton of NFT related themes which should generate interest and curiosity. Many of these people (who may also be builders/creatives) have not yet fully explored the crypto space, this will be an opportunity to capture their attention and encourage them to become involved with Nouns DAO.\n\n## Thing\nSharable hand painted mural art piece promoting NFT culture (optimised for social sharing on Twitter and Instagram) and website.\n\nWe have encouraged Jasper to create a mural in his style that is a conversational piece. The mural will act as an introduction to the crypto space for many newcomers, we hope that it inspires a sense of curiosity and an urge to dig deeper. For those in the know, the mural will act as a proverbial nod of acknowledgment to the projects that have made an impact and have shed a positive light on the crypto space in general. The mural will showcase popular CC0 and non-CC0 projects such as BAYC, Doodles, Moonbirds, Cryptoads, Chain Runners, CryptoPunks, Coolcats, World of Women, Creature World, DeadFellaz, Okay Bears, etc. Each of these projects have extremely large and very loyal followings which we believe will ensure that the mural reaches the widest audience possible. The goal is to create a compelling piece which shows unity within the crypto space and inspires the viewer to get involved. \n\n![N|Solid](https://i.imgur.com/HKKgICa.png)\n\nThe mural will be located at 300 W Broadway, next to the entrance of the Soho Grand Hotel, facing the busy Holland Tunnel) and will measure 8’9” H x 16’ W in size.\n\nAs mentioned above, the ultimate goal is to launch a continued effort to promote Nouns worldwide through art. NYC is the first stop of the tour. The Nouns IRL website will act as an artefact for this and all future activations. The website will contain high-res images, time lapse video, artist bio, story behind the art, and links to the discord, the main Nouns website, discourse, etc. \n\n## Budget (all figures are in USD):\n- Mural Wall: $62,000.00:\nA soft hold was placed on the mural location until the 27th of May; we are in communication with the mural company about extending the hold for at least another week. If we are able to keep the current location, the cost for the wall will be $36,000.00. The $62,000.00 amount is a rough quote for an alternate location. We are in communication with the wall company to determine if cheaper locations are available. We are more than willing to return any funds that we did not end up needing to use to secure the wall.\n- Artist: $40,000.00\n- Team: $25,000.00\n- Nouns IRL Landing page + capturing of video and photos for social: $11,000.00\n- Travel / Accommodations: $6,000.00\n\n**Total: $144,000.00, total ETH ask: 87.5 ETH**\n_Based on $1,700.00 price of ETH as of May 27, 2022; we have added 2.5 additional ETH to try and account for volatility and fees._\n\n## Team\nThis activation is being executed by the [Nouns Collective](https://twitter.com/Nounscollectiv3) (formerly the Collective DAO) which is a liquid super team made up of friends building playful, useful, and beautiful products and experiences with the crypto communities they love. We have previously contributed to the community via the [Nouns iOS app](https://www.nounsapp.wtf/) (proposal 6) which was officially launched on May 16, 2022. The Nouns Collective is composed of experienced founders, brand builders, and developers with over 15 years of experience building successful products. \n\nFor this activation we have teamed up with [@miss_singh](https://twitter.com/Miss_Singh) who is a creative professional, cultural connector, community builder, experiential expert, and entrepreneur. @miss_singh has over two decades of experience that spans industries from tech, marketing, fashion and retail with her most recent gig being with Shopify. @miss_singh is extremely excited to jump into the Web3 world with us and looks to use her considerable experience and talents to deliver a memorable and lasting experience.\n\n## To be Nountinued…\n\nWe are super excited to merge Nouns with IRL. The Nouns community is strong and vibrant; we hope to show the world who we are and what we are about. The best way to onboard more individuals, especially builders, into the space is to meet them where they are. DAOs, NFTs, blockchains, this can all be difficult to grasp for newcomers. Using familiar / traditional mediums of delivery (pop-ups, art, events, etc.) to introduce these concepts are an effective way to drive engagement.

Both have already compulsively created all manner of high quality nounish, memish content, which has garnered hundreds of thousands of impressions, and been shared countless (no, literally, we don’t know how to do this) times on twitter and discord by the wider community to express their nounishness and spread the meme.\n\nYou can see gifs already by GOAT CLUB here: [https://tenor.com/users/goldypix\n](https://tenor.com/users/goldypix)\nAnd more nounish content below:\n\n**![|588x832](https://www.dropbox.com/s/mc7wudpn0zraryj/goatclubnounishness_march2022.jpeg?dl=1)**\n\n**CONTENT**\nOur vision is to focus mostly on the content we know works; we want more of it.

(Happy to either host these on a Goat Club discord server or give to Nouns DAO server admins).\n\nWe will also make dedicated efforts to share this content, as natively as possible (as well as find ways to encourage others) via twitter and discord to increase awareness of the existence of all of them.

Additionally, to trial BLVKHVND as an operational partner for Nouns DAO esports.\n\n**Pokémon Unite:**\n\nPokémon Unite released in June 2021 and is a MOBA for Nintendo Switch and Mobile. Currently the Unite Championship Series (UCS) season 1 is underway with 1 monthly final, the regional championships ($50,000USD prize pool) and the world championship ($500,000USD prize pool) remaining until the conclusion of the season.\n\nThe official Pokémon Unite twitch channel shows 36 hours streamed over the last month with an average viewer count of 2,398 and a peak viewer count of 20,574. That peak occurred during the European AEOS Cup finals, which our proposed team won first place in. Due to that we can assume that the European Regional Finals and especially the Pokemon World Championships will beat that viewer count.\n\n**The Proposed Team:**\n\nThe proposed team we are looking to acquire is known as Random Gaming who have consistently placed 1st or 2nd in all European UCS events to date, including winning the AEOS Cup and the $20,000USD first place prize, with the top 2 teams from European Regional Championship qualifying for the World Championship on August 19th-21st in London we are confident in the team’s ability to qualify for this event.\n\nThe team consists of five players who are;\n\nADESu (Spain) - https://twitter.com/ADESuUnite 1 - Twitch\nRedmaw (Norway) - https://twitter.com/redmaw_ 1 - Twitch\nBruv (England) - https://twitter.com/BruvHD 3 - Twitch 1\nGyz (Spain) - https://twitter.com/Cepriii 1 - Twitch\nGhatlue (Germany) - https://twitter.com/Gatlue 1 - Twitch\n\nAt the time of writing this proposal, the team in total has 976 hours streamed on twitch in the last three months with a team average of 56 viewers at any given time. Most notably is BruvHD who averages 167 viewers throughout his streams in this three month period.\n\n**The Proposed Agreement:**\n\nThis proposal consists of a three month agreement with the team which will have them representing Nouns DAO for the remainder of the UCS. This agreement will consist of a signing bonus and funding a boot camp in London on the 15th - 20th of June in the lead up and during the European Regional Finals. This boot camp will be documented by a videographer to produce a mini series and various other forms of video content for the Nouns community to engage with and to spread Nouns around the gaming and Pokémon Unite community, we would be looking to utilize the Nouns DAO marketing studio, however we do have alternative options locally to London.\n\n**BLVKHVND:**\n\nBLVKHVND are the first decentralized esports organization, fielding teams through Halo, Counter Strike, Pokémon Unite, Apex Legends, Rogue Company and Blood hunt. Being knowledgeable in both the esports/gaming industry but also the web3 industry we are in a unique position to be able to contribute to this project with in depth understanding of both elements. Our involvement would be being the point of contact for the team, organizing and executing all the elements of this proposal and working alongside the existing Nouns DAO esports contributors in Sasquatch, Brennen and Brax to scale the current Nouns esports resources and continue to develop and improve the operations as well as increase our branding image and implementation of Nouns culture throughout the operation.\n\nOur tasks include but are not limited to;\n\n* Organizing and executing the Bootcamp in London on 15th - 20th of June, this consists of booking flights, accommodation, training facility, media for content creation and having a staff member on site to monitor and assist.\n* Working with the players and media contributors to create engaging content and roll out on YouTube and Twitter.\n* Monitoring events throughout the three month period and posting results to Twitter.\n* Networking with the existing Pokémon Unite community to spread the Nouns brand through additional tournaments and media opportunities.\n* Using BLVKHVND in-house media team in potential collaboration with the Nouns media studio to implement Nouns branding to the players social media accounts and content platforms such as youtube and twitch, this consists of banners, profile pictures and stream assets.\n* Using BLVKHVND in-house media team in potential collaboration with the Nouns media studio to create engaging images and short form video to post to twitter during tournaments to drive engagement and viewership to Nouns esports tournament performances.\n* Maintaining consistent communications with all the players on the team to ensure smooth operations throughout the agreement and guarantee a positive interaction between the team and Nouns esports.\n* Pending qualification for Pokémon World Championships in London on August 19th - 21st, organizing all flights and accommodation in collaboration with the Pokémon Company. During the event having a staff member escorting the team to assist them with anything they require.\n* Pending qualification for Pokémon World Championships in London on August 19th - 21st, organizing media for content creation surrounding the London event and working alongside them to roll out the media.\n* BLVKHVND sourced the team presented in this proposal, negotiated on the proposed offer and constructed the proposal presented.\n* All the expenses listed above being the labour, travel and accommodation are covered in the BLVKHVND management services fee. This includes the labour cost of designers, editors and videographers. The proposed fee will cover the full three months of operation.\n\n**Content Creation Expenses:**\n\nThe proposed allocated amount for content creation expenses is 1.5ETH, this is to cover travel and accommodation for videographers to London for the boot camp and potentially for the Pokémon World Championship pending qualification. The videographer will be paid for their time out of the BLVKHVND management services budget, however their travel expenses are separated.\n\n**Budget:**\n\n3 month salary & signing bonus - 2 ETH per player (10 ETH total)\n\nBootcamp cost (Flights, accommodation & facility hire) - 3 ETH\n\nContent creation expenses - 1.5 ETH\n\nBLVKHVND operational management services - 7.5 ETH\n\nTotal: 22 ETH\n\n**Multi-Sig:**\n\nBrennen.eth (Nouns Esports DAO)\nSasquatch (Nouns Esports DAO)\nBrax (Nouns Esports DAO)\nSirsu (BLVKHVND)\nTeelon (BLVKHVND)\n","proposer":"0xcC2688350d29623E2A0844Cc8885F9050F0f6Ed5","startBlock":14935241,"endBlock":14954951,"executed":true},"votes":[{"support":1,"voter":"0xA86882277E69FbF0a51805cdc8b0a3a113079E63","numberOfVotes":2,"reason":"E-sports can be a great way to do digital activations outside of the crypto sphere.

With the top-tier UX talent from 0xDesigner, the unmatched creative prowess of SerNoadz, the development expertise of Plaid Shaman, and Brkfstsndwh (along with a direct line to Patricio and the POAP team), we aim to deliver a creative and engaging experience that will continue the spin wheel and proliferation of the meme to a whole new audience.\n\n## Why\nThrough our V1 experiment, our team believes that having an ongoing incentive around bidding in the daily auction is not only beneficial to the DAO (promoting increased bidding on daily auctions to add capital to the treasury), but also allows more people to feel like they are a part of the DAO without actually winning the Noun on auction. POAP and team also have some fun ideas for incentives that will be coming via a secondary proposal (think, raffling off a Noun to POAP winners).\n\n## What\n- Revamped Gallery Page + Auction House and POAP Integrations\n- More Advanced Claiming Mechanism\n- Updated POAP Art with New Artists\n- Retroactive POAPs for Winners Since V1 Ended\n- 6 Months of POAPs and Management from Launch Date\n\n## How\n### Revamped Gallery Page + Integrations\n- We will work with our team of designers and developers to create a revamped gallery page for showcasing the daily POAP, past POAPs, and winning bidders.\n- This page will also show the live auction data for each daily auction, showcasing which bidders are currently in the running to receive one of the daily POAPs.\n- Beyond that, we will integrate the POAP API more seamlessly to make the entire experience of the POAP page more engaging and informative.\n\n### More Advanced Claiming Mechanism\n- With our direct connection to the POAP team, we will work on building a more robust claiming mechanism than the direct send we conducted in V1.\n\n### Updated POAP Art with New Artists\n- Working with the incredibly talented SerNoadz, we will create a unique and updated art style for the Bidder POAPs.\n- We will also aim to commission featured artists monthly that are voted on by the DAO to create unique POAP art in their own nounish style.\n- Below is just an example of some of SerNoadz’s work, and is by no means the final art style. We will work with the community to land on the final and approved art style for the key POAP art.\n- See example art and full prop [here](https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/proposal-nouns-bidder-poap-v2/1440).\n\n### Retroactive POAPs for Winners Since V1 Ended\n- Once the art is complete, we will retroactively send all POAPs to their rightful winners since V1 concluded in May at Noun 296.\n\n## Who\nProducer + Project Manager | Brkfstsndwch\n**Experience:** With close to a decade of production and product management experience, Brkfstsndwch has managed projects ranging from rebrands for some of tech’s biggest companies to 360 campaigns to website + app builds to feature-length documentaries and so many things in between. Brkfst was also responsible for the proposal and execution of the Bidder POAP V1 project, Nouns Coffee, and has been a part of the Nouns Community since the beginning.\n\nLead Artist | SerNoadz\n**Experience:** An artist that needs no introduction, SerNoadz has been a staple in the Nouns community nearly since its inception, proliferating Nouns day in and day out with their project Noadz, among a plethora of other crucial pieces that have helped the DAO become what it is today. Most recently the current Nouncil site.\n\nUX Designer | 0xDesigner\n**Experience:** Being the lead designer on the POAP V1 project, 0xDesigner has a proven track record at executing to the highest degree. Beyond their involvement in the DAO, 0x is a product designer with a decade of experience working with companies ranging from seed stage startups to big tech like Facebook and Google. 0x has designed and helped launch over 50 digital products via founding a globally ranked UX agency.\n\nDeveloper | Plaid Shaman\n**Experience:** For nearly 20 years, Plaid Shaman (Brian) has been working with startups, agencies, and non-profits bringing 100s of projects to life. More recently, they’ve been collaborating on Web3 projects to create innovative experiences with NFTs and other blockchain technology. A few most recent projects have included, NounCats, Contract Reader, Chowies, and more.\n\nCommissioned Artists | To Be Voted On by Community\n\n### Timeline\n**6-10 Weeks | Overall Timeline**\n- 4-6 Weeks | Revamped Gallery Page + Integrations\n- 4-6 Weeks | POAP Art Development\n- 2-4 Weeks | Claiming Mechanism Development\n- 1 Week | Retroactive POAP Shipment\n\n### Budget\n32.5 ETH | Revamped Gallery Page, Auction House + POAP Integration\n- 12.5 ETH | UX Design\n- 15 ETH | Development\n- 5 ETH | Project Management\n\n40 ETH | Updated POAP Art\n- 20 ETH | Key Art Development\n- 5 ETH | Art for Retroactive POAPs\n- 10 ETH | Commission Budget for POAP Artists\n- 5 ETH | Artist + Project Management\n\n5 ETH | Updated Claiming Mechanism Development\n6 ETH | 6 Month Management of POAP Sends\n2 ETH | Retroactive POAP Sends\n2.5 ETH | General Project Management and Community Project Lead\n\n**Total Funds Requested | 88 ETH**","proposer":"0xDb94Daa8bF1b6F45B122F442F922a2C4DD2F7aDe","startBlock":14942061,"endBlock":14961771,"executed":true},"votes":[{"support":1,"voter":"0xf6B6F07862A02C85628B3A9688beae07fEA9C863","numberOfVotes":14,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x8321795bdACE7428D4faDFA30C2EE8e727e491e5","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0xA86882277E69FbF0a51805cdc8b0a3a113079E63","numberOfVotes":2,"reason":"While poap v1 was not entirely w/o problems id like to see the team take another shot at this.\n\nUltimately, projects built around the auction/NOC are worthwhile endeavors we should cont to experiment with.\n\nI also like the way brkfstsndwch has responded to criticism re poap v1."},{"support":2,"voter":"0xD19BF5F0B785c6f1F6228C72A8A31C9f383a49c4","numberOfVotes":2,"reason":"i worked on v1."},{"support":1,"voter":"0xa8d04Cd4e1951291740Ef977d56336fDC7f394c5","numberOfVotes":3,"reason":"I have heard and read the criticism of V1, but willing to give this team of active, talented, and engaged community members another shot at what can be a really great asset around the daily auction, if properly executed.

This proposal is to ask Nouns to fund a repository of cc0 space images for all artists to use freely in their work. Sponsored by the Nouns DAO, the website will feature nounish elements as well as an \"about section\" with information about Nouns. The Nouns ecosystem will be proliferated through exposure to the artistic community as well as any potential exposure from the featuring of the space images on mainstream and specialized media. Total amount requested: 12 Eth.\n\n# About me:\nIf you prefer to watch instead of reading, check out this short video I made for my SuperRare application to learn more about myself and my work. \n\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1iffK8n9uYuJgV8BmHjQaYXPuhgGmvHxi/view?usp=sharing\n\nMy passion for space and astronomy started at a very early age and I started shooting astrophotography about 7 years ago when I first paired a camera to the eyepiece of my telescope. After doing this as a hobby for several years, two years ago I decided to quit my job in TV and film production to become a full time astrophotographer. In early 2021 I minted my first NFT and throughout this past year I've released two collections and over 20 1/1 NFTs. During this past year, my work has been featured across several media outlets such as NASA’s Astronomy Picture of the Day and the European Space Agency's social media profiles, as well as a number of astronomy websites and magazines, and I've even had the honor of having one of my pictures used as a stamp of the Argentine Postal Service.\n\n\n\n# Goal:\n\nAs a way to give visibility to the Nouns DAO, a cc0 image bank of space images will be set up that will serve as a repository for artists working on space-themed art. Space is a huge theme in cryptoart and NFTs. These images will be free to be used as subjects, backdrops and to be repurposed as artists see fit without the need to attribute authorship, giving artists complete control. The url **cc0images.wtf** has already been secured to this end.\n\n**Nouns proliferation:**\n\nThe website would be designed in line with the Nouniverse aesthetics and would contain an \"about'' section with information about Nouns. Besides strengthening ties and gaining visibility within the artist community, space images are regularly featured on specialized and mainstream media, which could potentially increase visibility to the Nouns community outside the art/NFT circles, by being featured by space agencies and more traditional media outlets reaching the general public.

Taking hours and sometimes several nights to shoot with long exposures, these hi-res images combine complex processing skills with specialized equipment, resulting in unique artworks that capture the beauty that lies in outer space.\n\n# Example images:\n\n*NOTE: These are example images from my current body of work, all of the images for the image bank would be shot specifically for this project as stated in this proposal.*\n\n**Carina Nebula**\n\nLocated 7.500 light years away, the Carina Nebula is a region of ionized gas and space dust almost 500 light years across.\n\n![690x460]( https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/nouns/original/2X/e/e0388931de7aff71c05340b22cc050998b36d8f7.jpeg)\n\n**Lambda Centauri**\n\nIC 2944 or Lambda Centauri is an emission nebula located in the constellation of the Centaur.\n\n![690x460]( https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/nouns/original/2X/a/ab9e7457e1bc3f16493a8b4d0a80304251b6dbf4.jpeg)\n\n**Sun**\n\nActive regions 2993 and 2994 in the solar chromosphere imaged through a Hydrogen Alpha filter.\n\n![690x460](https://static.wixstatic.com/media/e2982b_b522ed9029144fa9b06c10bab3629fbf~mv2.jpg/v1/fill/w_420,h_584,al_c,lg_1,q_80,enc_auto/16_50_32_lapl5_ap4496%20wavelets%20copy%20ps%20(1).jpg) \n\n\n**Moon**\n\n30 panel mosaic of the Moon.\n\n![690x460](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/nouns/original/2X/2/2cba2114b0adcf3a73362bbb399e173c083af6f4.jpeg)\n\n\n**Deepscape** the core of the Milky Way rises over the archaeological site of Yacoraite in the Andes.

Tens of hours of exposures as well as extensive processing time are needed in order to capture these objects, and most objects only appear in the night sky during limited periods of time during the year so the collection would be slowly built throughout an entire year. Some of the images will be shot from my rooftop observatory but others require traveling to dark sky sites. The images will be a balanced mix of deep space objects shot on telescopes, solar system bodies (Sun, Moon and planets), widefield images (star fields, milky way shots, star trail images) and landscape astrophotography, to offer a wider variety of objects and backdrops for artists.\n\nLaunch of the website would be scheduled six months after proposal is approved with an initial amount of 15 images at launch, and another 15 images would be added after a second six month period (this second update could be scheduled at shorter, more frequent intervals with a smaller amount of images).\n\n# Budget\n\nProject management and execution, consisting of planning and acquiring the images throughout a one year period - 5 Eth\n\nEquipment upgrades (purchases to upgrade equipment already owned) - 3 eth\n\nExpenses for dark sky sites travel - 2 eth\n\nWebsite development and maintenance (according to scope of this proposal) - 2 eth\n\nTotal: 12 Eth\n\n**Thank you for reading!

This is a world first: a community-owned baked bean brand, and a true collaboration between Nouns and Sublime Butter (that’s us). To deliver on this vision, we’re asking for $150,000 (c.135 Ether).\n\n---\n\n**Who we are**\n\nWe’re Sublime Butter Ltd. We’re a UK-based butter company with a huge array of awards under our belt. We have excellent in-roads with distributors, a proven track record of amazing product development, and a profound understanding of brand.\n\n[![https://i.ibb.co/949CgRH/Awards.jpg](https://i.ibb.co/949CgRH/Awards.jpg)](https://sublimebutter.com/)\n\nBut that’s not all. We have in our midst a team of powerful developers, designers, storytellers, marketers and strategists who are at the absolute top of their game. Between us we have won two Emmy awards, three Webby awards, and had two BAFTA nominations.\n\n---\n\n**What are the opportunities?**\n\n1) There are a variety of legal, regulatory and licensing must-haves required to be an FMCG brand. It also takes a lot of skill, knowledge and experience to develop, produce and distribute a successful FMCG product. This makes it a tough market for a DAO to break into. UNLESS you have us as a partner. \n\n2) The baked bean industry in the UK is ENORMOUS. Brits get through two million tins of them every single day. And yet, it is one of the plainest and most uninventive verticals on a supermarket shelf. We think this makes it ripe for disruption.\n\n---\n\n**Introducing MOOØNBEANS**\n\nNouns-branded baked beans, developed according to Sublime’s incredible recipe. Each 400g tin will be sold for c. £2.50.\n\nWe really want to stress that this is a true collaboration, a first-of-type web3/CC0/real-world merger. Nobody has ever done anything like this before, because such a relationship has never been fostered before. It’s truly symbiotic, totally unprecedented, and paints an extremely exciting picture for the future.\n\nEach tin will feature a Nouns character that is also represented in our marketing and on-site. We’re thinking four tin variants should be a good place to start for launch.\n\nNouns DAO will get **20% of all profits** from MOOØNBEANS sales. \n\nMoreover, getting this right (which we know we will) opens up a huge range of other opportunities in the FMCG space, and therefore a huge range of prospective revenue streams into the Nouns ecosystem. \n\n![https://i.ibb.co/mHg8fJr/Can-V2.jpg](https://i.ibb.co/mHg8fJr/Can-V2.jpg)\n\n*Here’s a mock-up of some tins. Note: This is **super early,** and designed for illustrative purposes only. The actual branding, tins, website, etc. — all of which are a part of the scope of work — will be truly, abundantly Nounish.*\n\n---\n\n**Why we’re doing this**\n\n- We believe in web3/CC0\n- We love Nouns and everything it represents; we want to raise awareness of Nouns in an area that’s usually difficult to break into\n- We want to position Sublime as a pioneering FMCG brand in the web3 space\n- We believe there are a range of collaboration opportunities here, and this is an excellent test case for future disruption together\n- We want to build a solid foundation for the wider MOOØNBEANS ecosystem\n\n**Budget**\n\nWe are asking for $150k USD to take MOOØNBEANS to market (c.135 $ETH at the time of writing). Proposal costings within the model have been denominated in fiat because of the nature of FMCG engagements and their payments.\n\nBudget Breakdown\n\n- Brand & Product Development – $25k USD\n- Website & eCom – $25k USD\n- Initial MOOØNBEAN Production – $35k USD\n- Initial Marketing – $65k USD\n- **Total: $150k**\n\nProfits from MOOØNBEANS will be consolidated in ETH and proportionally distributed back to a Nouns wallet address of your choosing on a monthly basis from month seven post launch.\n\nA full model for the proposal is available as a spreadsheet on request.\n\n**Deliverables**\n\nIn terms of our approach to delivering this project, we wanted to stress that we’ll be operating with full transparency. MOOØNBEANS will function as a distinct profit centre, and all accounts will be made public for the Nouns community to view. \n\nIn terms of specifics, we’ll be delivering the following:\n\n- Brand development for MOOØNBEANS\n- Content strategy\n- Product development\n- Distribution strategy (UK first, then US by next year)\n- Basic website development\n- Integrated eCom functionality built into both [mooonbeans.com](https://mooonbeans.com) and [sublimebutter.com](http://sublimebutter.com) enabling the purchase of MOOØNBEANS\n- Marketing plan with a heavy focus on mainstream consumer press\n\n**Benefits to Nouns**\n\n- Access to CPG/FMCG\n- Real world revenues; first of its kind\n- Major marketing and PR exposure\n- Exciting new way to get people into crypto\n- Future potential (e.g. other verticals)\n\n**Timings**\n\n---\n\n![https://i.ibb.co/HFYQt37/Whats-App-Image-2022-06-10-at-11-57-31-AM.jpg](https://i.ibb.co/HFYQt37/Whats-App-Image-2022-06-10-at-11-57-31-AM.jpg)\n\n\n**Future Phases**\n\nIf you’ve seen V1 of this proposal, you’ll know that we have a big vision for MOOØNBEANS. One that extends beyond physical products. Once we have successfully delivered on this core proposition, we have a huge range of ideas that will deepen and enhance it — with a view to stimulating mass consumer adoption, further proliferating Nouns and its derivatives, and creating other FMCG goods that will expand the Nouns x Sublime brand universe. Ideas like:\n\n- Educational content that guides novices through their first crypto transactions/interactions\n- Games, stories, and easter eggs that spotlight Nouns and other communities\n\n**Transaction Details**\n\ntx1: 135E to sublime.eth (proposal funding)\n\ntx2: 0.69E to apenoun.eth (coordination & prop building)\n\nN.b. The plan will be to convert all the ETH to USDC/stablecoin assuming proposal passes\n\n**Project updates**\n\nFortnightly Twitter Spaces\n\nFortnightly Medium progress update posts\n\nDiscord community updates\n\n---\n\n**Closing**\n\nThanks so much for reading and considering our proposal, Nouners. We’re always around to answer questions or even just to chat, so we look forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\n\nTeam MOOØNBEANS","proposer":"0x91dCCAA260CC4616E1a6e6b693DB7207C5E42937","startBlock":14990115,"endBlock":15009825,"executed":true},"votes":[{"support":0,"voter":"0xAca3b4110403F3c4dacb35A7B3Aa0a84eFb6A3e9","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":0,"voter":"0xE8D24bE3ABF6EB27B800F752A969D3C1E84fD401","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x91dCCAA260CC4616E1a6e6b693DB7207C5E42937","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0xcC2688350d29623E2A0844Cc8885F9050F0f6Ed5","numberOfVotes":12,"reason":"\"Premium OpenSauce baked beans\" 🙏"},{"support":1,"voter":"0x9a2F6117D1FFa82ad0A2B36f133d476DB5bD55F5","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":0,"voter":"0x75Ee6eb3d8DAcf41eE2e5307090B197D3E1Cca6E","numberOfVotes":2,"reason":"Very thoughtful proposal but unfortunately I just do not think it serves the DAO's goals"},{"support":2,"voter":"0xBd7Dbab9AEb52D6c8d0E80fCeBdE3af4CC86204A","numberOfVotes":6,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x83fCFe8Ba2FEce9578F0BbaFeD4Ebf5E915045B9","numberOfVotes":10,"reason":"appreciate the founders flexibility based on feedback from the dao, and proposal is unique enough that i'm curious to see how this plays out. everyone i've mentioned it to thinks this proposal is hilarious, and that fact alone has a lot of memetic power and potential asymmetry. to the mooon!"},{"support":1,"voter":"0xD19BF5F0B785c6f1F6228C72A8A31C9f383a49c4","numberOfVotes":3,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0xA86882277E69FbF0a51805cdc8b0a3a113079E63","numberOfVotes":2,"reason":"I was very close to voting No on this.

I propose to display nouns glasses on 5 sailboats in the middle of Seoul, South Korea. Seoul is home to 15+ million people and a lot of interest towards blockchain and NFTs among the population. The Korean government, businesses, and people are interested in blockchain and the NFT space. Hangang river is surrounded by two highways and will be a perfect place to reach lots of people during rush hours. The two way distance will be around 40+ kilometers. This could be a great opportunity to advertise NounsDAO and attract potential future members and developers.\n- I know lots of sailors who want to participate in the Nouns Seoul PR campaign. I will create a fleet of five J/24 sailboats and sail along the river from Kimpo international airport to Itaewon bridge and back. This event is going to be organized for NounsDAO. There will be only 5 sailboats with spinnakers with Nouns Glasses logos.\n- The idea is to make as many people remember Nouns-glasses. I identify two types of impressions offline and online. Images of Nouns glasses on 5 sailboat in the middle of the river will spark curiosity in the minds of the bypassers. This campaign is not a spam like poster or post that many of us learned to ignore without noticing. People would remember Nouns glasses and later when they attend a conference or buy NFTs they would recognize the Nouns symbol and would eventually come straight to the NounsDAO!\n- The spinnakers are big and span an area of 8 meters in height and 4 meters in width. They definitely can be used as decoration at different events. I think the best use for sails is to give them to the teams.

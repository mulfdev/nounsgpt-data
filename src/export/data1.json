Early on, it appeared to me that these 32*32 characters would make great voxel models and could potentially be turned into 3D avatars for the metaverse. I kept making those models and posting them on Twitter as animated GIFs.\\n## What Is It?\\nSimilar to the Nouns playground, we would like to build a web app to let users create and download custom 3D Nouns. Users could pick attributes or leave the drop down to random (default value).\\n\\nThink of the « build your character » screen at the beginning of a game. You compose your Noun, and can test a few animations on your build, like \"walk\", \"run\", or \"dance\". Once you are done, there is a download button that outputs a textured and rigged GLTF file.\\n\\nThis extends the ecosystem beyond 2D into the 3D world and allows for animations, games, renders and more to be built using those prefabs. It opens a world of possibilities for the nouns ecosystem and will result in more derivatives and more memes over time.\\n## Project Ethos\\nThe project will be open sourced under GNU GPLv3 and all the 3D art will be available to download and use via the interface. We will share the code on Github once the project is completed. Our goal is to encourage artists and engineers to build on top of this and extend the Noun ecosystem.\\n## Scope of the Project\\nIn order to complete a working version of that site, we need:\\n1. All project assets modeled in 3D:\\n* 236 heads\\n* 30 bodies\\n* 136 accessories\\n* 19 glasses\\n+ Additional assets for the lower body (following existing colors):\\n* Approx. 30 pants\\n* Approx. 30 shoes\\n2. All assets rigged and animations clips preloaded into the GLTF models\\n3. A React + Three.JS (using react-three-fiber) interface that allows us to:\\nLoad all 3D files and texture in a database\\nCreate a front end with drop down menus for each of the six attributes + a 3D viewer in a viewport + 3-4 buttons to autoplay animations (idle, walk, run, dance).\\nBuild a random function to compose 3D nouns as the default drop down.\\nClick a download button to get your rigged and textured 3D noun, ready to be imported in a game engine or 3D editing software (GLTF, OBJ, VOX etc)\\nWe currently have a WIP proof of concept at [https://nouns.vercel.app](https://nouns.vercel.app). We bought [www.voxelnouns.com](www.voxelnouns.com) and [www.3Dnouns.com](www.3Dnouns.com). We also bought voxelnouns.eth and 3Dnouns.eth and will transfer them to the DAO on launch.\\n## Who Is Building This?\\n* CoralOrca - [https://twitter.com/coralorca](https://twitter.com/coralorca)\\n* OxFloyd - [https://twitter.com/0xFloyd](https://twitter.com/0xFloyd)\\n## Compensation\\nA total of 32 ETH to be transferred to the address below in one full payment:\\n* 28 ETH for V1 of the site as detailed in the scope of the project section\\n* 4 ETH for 1 year of maintenance including hosting, domain name, SSL certificate, cross-browser compatibility testing, mobile/desktop testing, back-ups, librairies/software upgrades. Also setting metric tools for checking website performance page load speed, responsiveness, stability, etc. If necessary, scaling for increased site traffic.\\n\\n**0x9c74aE08Fd4337E14786f086D911E964df35e623**\\n\\nSubsequent years of maintenance and future improvements/features to come in separate proposals. For future improvements, see the list below.\\n## What Could Be Built on Top of 3D Nouns?\\n* Allow users to walk/run/jump and control their noun in a 3D world using the keyboard or touch screen on their mobile device.\\n* Allow users to download AR files (USDZ file).\\n* Allow users to upload their 3D nouns design following the voxel template and organize a competition where the best nouns are selected. This would require user accounts.\\n* Option to mint your own 3D noun.","proposer":"0x2573C60a6D127755aA2DC85e342F7da2378a0Cc5","startBlock":13108132,"endBlock":13127842,"executed":true},"votes":[{"support":1,"voter":"0xf476Cd75BE8Fdd197AE0b466A2ec2ae44Da41897","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x008c84421dA5527F462886cEc43D2717B686A7e4","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0xA58899BBC983781d47C7Dd5A6b8aEEf53Cd34Bbc","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x54BE3a794282C030b15E43aE2bB182E14c409C5e","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x1254958BD5073C6B238E516298f0c48f6f60A78e","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0xeB1c22baACAFac7836f20f684C946228401FF01C","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x912A526852527dfB5D44c22a15B708AA493cDa6B","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x2573C60a6D127755aA2DC85e342F7da2378a0Cc5","numberOfVotes":2,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0xAe7f458667f1B30746354aBC3157907d9F6FD15E","numberOfVotes":3,"reason":""}]},{"prop":{"id":3,"description":"# Nouns Party\n\nNouns party is an effort aimed at making community-driven nouns bidding easier, more interactive, and more likely to win than today's strategies. \n\n## Links\n[Proposal Document](https://www.notion.so/Nouns-Party-020ce483fef64391831eb69d3e71fa74)\n\n## Scope\nThe new [nouns.party](http://nouns.party) will include a completely updated design and several innovations which should dramatically simplify group bidding while increasing the odds of success. This will transition [nouns.party](http://nouns.party) from a simple fork to a pool-driven bidding application for nouns. This will require new contracts, a new application, and a new design. \n\nThe following functionality will be included labeled by versions. V0 will be guaranteed to launch for the completion of this proposal. V1 items will be built as time permits within the 4-week scope. \n\n- **[V0]** Party contributions will be deposited in a \"vault\" style contract which carries forward from one noun auction to the next. These contributions will be withdraw-able at any time outside of an active winning bid. If they are not withdrawn, they **will automatically accumulate for the next noun auction.**\n- **[V0]** Nouns won through these contributions will be automatically fractionalized for the winners. Contributors can then claim the shares of their winning noun. If multiple nouns are won, they can claim all shares at once.\n- **[V0]** Real-time whale bidding viewer, to help inform the party. The UI will display any pending bids.\n    - **[V1]** We will also show the estimated remaining Ethereum for the top bidder.\n- **[V0]** Manual group bid submission when sufficient Ethereum is gathered.\n    - **[V1]** Auto-bidder mechanism to avoid bidding confusion and democratize gas fees\n- **[V0]** Currently nouns purchased through party bid must pay an upfront 5% Eth fee for each party noun. This fee is used for the ongoing maintenance and development of partybid. We propose the same fee, but instead of a \"pre-auction\" fee, we will introduce a post-auction fractionalization 5% token supply fee awarded to the nouns party multi-sig. This fee will apply to any nouns won through nouns party.\n- **[V0]** Social Cursors with a noun-y style\n    - **[V1]** If cursors become a UI burden, we will explore avenues to remove that burden\n    - **[V1]** We will explore a social platformer-type game\n\n## Contributors & Compensation\n\nWe ask that the nounsdao fund the design & development of this project. Additionally, we plan to introduce a 5%  per \"party noun\" win post-fractionalization fee (matching the existing fees of the party bid mechanic). This fee will be allocated to the [nouns.party](http://nouns.party) multi-sig.\n\n\n### Design and Development funding - Ξ96\n\n**Role:** Project lead & Software Engineer (Node+Go+Front-end, Solidity contract review)\n**Compensation:** Ξ48 (Ξ32 + Ξ16 escrow for contributor compensation)\n**Handle:** @devloper_eth (aka noun#13)\n**Wallet:** 0x912A526852527dfB5D44c22a15B708AA493cDa6B\n\n**Role:** Sr. Software Engineer (Solidity)\n**Compensation:** Ξ32\n**Handle:** hans_klaus#0998 on discord (aka noun#13 colleague) \n**Wallet:** 0xA340828B995016437351890D6b98AeC698E2ef74  \n\n**Role:** Front-end Engineer\n**Compensation:** Ξ8 (50% at proposal vote), Ξ8 (50% dispatched from escrow upon completion)\n**Handle:** @0xFloyd\n**Wallet:** 0xbFc80468Df050D2a73fE455d6b3e484caF00E12f  \n\n\n**Role:** UX/UI designer\n**Compensation:** Ξ8 (50% at proposal vote), Ξ8 (50% dispatched from escrow upon completion)\n**Handle:** @bstsrvdbld\n**Wallet:** 0x73F843d1668E36a2952F2e505879Fac9ABbf3dB4\n\n\n## Future Direction\nWhile we believe that nouns party is the highest impact work we can do today, we also believe there are many other exciting nouns' related behaviors that can be improved.  Those include predicting the next noun, announcing pending bids, and clarifying fractional governance. We also believe there are social aspects, such a \"register an e-mail to be notified\", which can open up additional nouns opportunities in the future.\n\nWe are excited to explore more opportunities in this direction.","proposer":"0x912A526852527dfB5D44c22a15B708AA493cDa6B","startBlock":13155118,"endBlock":13174828,"executed":true},"votes":[{"support":1,"voter":"0x912A526852527dfB5D44c22a15B708AA493cDa6B","numberOfVotes":2,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0xf476Cd75BE8Fdd197AE0b466A2ec2ae44Da41897","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0xC3b80922832450AAbAFE6AaE8a6Aaf1E5E6158eA","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x9646E0F7544B8eE3649e7aC77eef0Cf5B53B748A","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x54BE3a794282C030b15E43aE2bB182E14c409C5e","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0xD049b3064990869C9F73bD7896271d83325D2067","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x2573C60a6D127755aA2DC85e342F7da2378a0Cc5","numberOfVotes":3,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0xAe7f458667f1B30746354aBC3157907d9F6FD15E","numberOfVotes":3,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x75Ee6eb3d8DAcf41eE2e5307090B197D3E1Cca6E","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""}]},{"prop":{"id":4,"description":"# Verbs Prop #1: NOUN O'CLOCK AUTOMATION APP\\n\\n## IDEA: NOUN O'CLOCK AUTOMATION APP\\n\\nWe spoke with @4156#9052 and love his ideas of *Noun'o'clock* as an Internet cultural moment.

See schedule below:\n![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/BgbXeDvLixaC72v2vyE2fItB6m-_4AzgaEG6muxCixa-Xi0pKJSkU5DCCAE30DmjLSMgOuTT4PjOcyw6jJuf3F32P1eqbp-NffE617AU8vZlotywwkCOEF-F9ljK4Mx5kaJihnbT=s0)\n\n\n**Co-creation**\nWe love to build in public and plan to work in close collaboration with the Nouns community, through co-creation workshops and consistent feedback loops via Discord. We will be running a beta test of both the iOS and Watch applications to identify bugs early and other deficiencies, in the aim of increasing build quality and level of polish before launch.\n\n**Team**\nCollective DAO is a liquid super team made up of friends building playful, useful, and beautiful products with the crypto communities they love.\n\nWe’re really excited to focus our creative energy on Nouns (our fav NFT project ).\n\nInspired by Nouns DAO origin story, we assembled a dream team of experts to bring the Nouns app vision to life.

The project entails creating two 4 metre (12 foot) high bronze sculptures that will stand side by side in a major international city. One sculpture shall be of Nouns and the other will be of Noir.\\n\\n### What is it?\\n\\n#### Art\\nThe Nouns sculpture will be based on one Noun. The selection process of the Noun could be contentious and the process will need to be established, or at the least explored, in advance of any funding. The process needs to be collectively agreed on by the Nouns.\\n\\nNoir's sculpture will be an iconic 'Super Classic Head' of the kind Noir originated on the Berlin Wall in the 1980s. Noir’s early physical world avatars clandestinely painted on the Wall were a form of political activism through art and represented the people of Berlin at the time.\\n\\nThe NOUNS x NOIR sculptures are intended to be harmonious. Equal in height and overall proportions. Yet a juxtaposition will be apparent between the pixelated Noun and the more rounded analogue Noir. The sculptures are intended to be original works of original art and are not statues.  \\n  \\n#### Method\\nBoth sculptures will be cast at the largest fine art bronze foundry in Europe and either traditionally patinated or painted. A suitable permanent and prominent public location will be secured in a major international city and the sculptures will be installed together in dialogue.\\n\\nThe entire process of creation at the foundry through to installation shall be documented through film (ground and drone), photography and timelapse. Each stage of traditional bronze casting shall be captured.\\n\\nThe story of the project shall be told.\\n\\nThe resulting documentary will attract an audience drawn from both the native crypto world and the art world and propagate a crossover between the two worlds.\\n\\n### Scope of the Project\\n#### Project management and fabricators\\nThierry Noir and his studio team will oversee the day to day management of the project.\\n\\nThe proposed bronze foundry is Pangolin Editions ([https://pangolin-editions.com](https://pangolin-editions.com)). Pangolin Editions is one of the foremost fine art bronze foundries in the world and extremely highly regarded.\\n\\nFor transportation and public installation, MTEC are proposed ([https://www.mtecfreightgroup.com](https://www.mtecfreightgroup.com)). MTEC specialise in the installation of public sculptures internationally.\\n\\nBoth organisations have already been engaged about the project and have provided quotations for the work.\\n\\n#### Public location\\nTo justify the effort and expense of the project, the intention is to situate the NOUNS x NOIR sculptures at a permanent location in a major international city such as New York, London, Paris, Seoul or Tokyo.\\n\\nA major public area within the selected city is also essential to the legacy of the project. A public park or square will be the desired location. This will allow the sculptures to become an iconic landmark within the city and also serve as a meeting point.\\n\\nSuch a location will also facilitate the greatest number of people as possible to enjoy them, provide an aesthetically pleasing and iconic backdrop and create high culture impact internationally.\\n\\nThe ideal is to locate the sculptures on municipal land and not privately owned land. This chimes with the themes of freedom within the art of both Nouns and Noir.\\n\\nA 99 year lease (based on a standard form public art precedent) of the sculptures will be granted to the location.\\n\\n#### Past Discussions\\n[Initial discussion on Nouns DIscord](https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/nouns-x-noir-proposal/87)\\n[Further discussion on Nouns DAO Discourse](https://discord.com/channels/849745721544146955/884419393864495114/884513517535912026)\\n\\nThis project is phase specific with further advancement based upon the success of the preceding phase as decided by the Nouns DAO.\\n\\n  \\n\\n## Phase 1: Design and Scouting\\n\\nThis proposal relates to the first design and scouting phase of the project.\\n\\n#### Objectives:\\n- Originate the forms of each sculpture.\\n- Decide which Noun the Nouns sculpture shall be based on or to design the process for selecting the Noun.\\n- Scout for locations for the sculptures.\\n\\n#### Timescale:\\n- A timeline of 3 months is anticipated in order to achieve the above objectives.\\n\\n  \\n\\n### Progression to Phase 2: Fabrication and Installation\\n\\nShould the outcome of the design process be deemed unsuccessful from a collaborative, aesthetic or other standpoint the project will likely not progress to Phase 2.\\n\\nShould locations for the sculptures not be forthcoming then the project will likely not progress to Phase 2. If a location should then present itself in the future the option will remain to resume the project, such a decision will be subject to NounsDAO decision making.\\n\\nAn initial outline draft of Phase 2 is below. This draft document provides and overview of the bronze casting process and detail around the public installation of the sculptures. A budget based on official quotes from suppliers is also laid out.\\n\\n[Phase 2: Fabrication and Installation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1q8ZomF3u5WzWsQtWeg_QCW0KbOlAG5VAiI0dshLAF0E/edit#)\\n\\n### Compensation\\nThe artist is not seeking any compensation for his work on this project, will dedicate over a year of studio time to both phases of the project and is donating all project management resources. The artist can also add extra funding if needed.\\n\\nFollowing an invitation from the Nouns, the NOUNS x NOIR project is envisioned as a collaboration. It is therefore fitting that both sides should provide resources to the project.\\n\\nThe hope is that the project will be regarded as an important art historical crossover between two distinct artistic movements. Purely from an artistic standpoint, the prospect to work on an important public art project such as this is compensation alone.\\n\\nThe nature and spirit of Noir’s artworks originated on the Berlin Wall has since resulted in a largely self funded public art practice outside any top down commissioning processes. This project is being approached in a similar fashion.\\n\\n### Budget\\nSome hard costs arise do arise out of this phase of the project to a total of Ξ5\\n\\n- (i) sculpting and CAD design at the bronze foundry Ξ2;\\n- (ii) CNC milling and 3D printing of maquettes Ξ1;\\n- (iii) initial structural engineering work Ξ1; and\\n- (iv) travel provision for international site visits Ξ1.\\n\\n#### Funding Schedule\\n\\nΞ5 payable at the onset of the project.\\n  \\n### Who is building this:\\n\\nThierry Noir is a French artist based in Berlin. You can read more about him here: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thierry_Noir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thierry_Noir)  \\n\\nThierry Noir will manage the project in collaboration with the Nouns. Thierry Noir has assembled an in-house team highly experienced in delivering international public art projects, including monumental bronze public sculptures, from inception to completion.","proposer":"0x2573C60a6D127755aA2DC85e342F7da2378a0Cc5","startBlock":13282499,"endBlock":13302209,"executed":true},"votes":[{"support":1,"voter":"0x17bEaA158E68FF9225b4c85151831C7a0D8F258D","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x6f9e3976fa3b5b22761fe5D635E1f0d9d9aeB85d","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x43A330deC81bbd5E21f41c6B8354E54d481Efc93","numberOfVotes":4,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0xf476Cd75BE8Fdd197AE0b466A2ec2ae44Da41897","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0xA8b4367f09e63a5234AbD14f5eF6868B1AED0e7d","numberOfVotes":2,"reason":""}]},{"prop":{"id":8,"description":"# FOMO Nouns\\n\\n## What Is It?\\n\\nWe propose a tool that allows the Nouns community to vote on and mint the most appealing Nouns for each auction in real time.\\n\\nAs background, Nouns are psuedo-randomly generated for each auction based on the block when the prior auction is settled. Each block generates a unique Noun, and recent auctions have been settled on a random block when either the auction winner wants to receive their Noun or a random user wants to start the next auction.\\n\\nWe believe the Noun community can benefit from more deliberating selecting the next Noun for a number of reasons:\\n - More appealing Nouns build the appeal of the Nouns art\\n - More appealing Nouns have generally garnered higher bids in recent auctions. This helps build the Nouns treasury and influence.\\n - Voting enables wider community participation in the Nouns project even for users who don't hold and are unlikely to win a Noun\\n - The voting and settlement setup provides even more excitement around Noun O'Clock\\n\\nWe propose building a website that will allow community members to vote on whether to settle in a given block and mint a particular Noun, and if sufficient votes are received, immediately settle the auction in the same block to mint the desired Noun.\\n\\n\\n### Origin of the Project\\n\\nThis idea grew out of Shark DAO's interest in forcing a Shark to be minted for the DAO to acquire. After some discussion, we realized the whole Nouns community may have preferences on what Nouns to mint, and we could set this up as a platform for the community to voice their preferred attributes for the benefit of the broader Nouns ecosystem.\\n\\nThe builders:\\n|   [@_forager](https://twitter.com/_forager)   |     [@0xrayo](https://twitter.com/0xRayo)     |\\n|:---------------------------------------------:|:---------------------------------------------:|\\n| ![](https://i.imgur.com/Qr903QF.jpg =200x200) | ![](https://i.imgur.com/HCfkVnO.jpg =200x200) |\\n\\n\\n## Project Details\\n\\nThe website will allow users to see the Noun mintable in every block (approximately every 15 seconds). It will also contain relevant information and analytics (e.g. available settlement funds, whether any attributes would be the first minted).\\n\\nIn a short window after each block appears, users will be able to vote on whether the new Noun is attractive enough to mint. Voting may be binary (i.e. yes/no) or score based (i.e. 0-10), and it will require a threshold that adjusts based on the number of active users. MetaMask sign-in will be required to prevent vote spamming.\\n\\nAll features will aim to be fun, social, and interface. Ideas include voting via emoji (🤢 to 🥰), social cursor interactions (ala PartyBid), a real-time vote progress bar, and/or POAP awards for some-or-all participants during voting.\\n\\n### Early Mock-up\\n![](https://i.imgur.com/VSM5otQ.png =50%x50%)\\n\\nVotes will be tallied in real-time on the backend. If a sufficient number of votes are received, settlement will be instantly initiated. Settlement must occur in the same-block, so Flashbots will be used to speed inclusion. This will require a contract to provide miner tips and ensure the settlement transaction is not mined in later blocks.\\n\\nA contract will be also be built to store community donations and fund settlement costs.\\n\\n\\n## Project Deliverables\\n\\nThe project will encompass the following deliverables and support for 1 year.\\n\\n * **Development**\\n     * Frontend:\\n         * Instant display of mintable Nouns\\n         * Metamask integration\\n         * Voting mechanism\\n         * Social integration for chat, emojis, other fun mechanics\\n         * Relevant Noun analytics & history\\n     * Backend:\\n         * Aggregate and store user votes\\n         * Calculate and store relevant Noun analytics\\n         * Secure kick-off of auction settlement\\n     * Contract:\\n         * Accept community donations to fund settlement\\n         * Pay for instant block inclusion (via Flashbots)\\n         * Ensure late block inclusion is prevented\\n     * E2E Speed:\\n         * Settlement must occur **extremely** rapidly to ensure inclusion requiring tuning and optimizing each component\\n * **Infrastructure & Deployment** (1 year)\\n     * Frontend:\\n         * Domain name registration\\n         * Website hosting & SSL\\n         * Alchemy/Infura monitoring integration\\n     * Backend:\\n         * Redis (or other storage) hosting\\n         * Settlement infrastructure\\n         * Alchemy/Infura settlement integration\\n     * Contract:\\n         * Contract deployment\\n         * Settlement contract tests\\n\\n## Project Funding\\n\\nWe propose funding of **50 ETH** to help support the deliverables above. This will be split:\\n - 28 ETH to [@_forager](https://twitter.com/_forager) for settlement backend, contract for donations and Flashbots payment, on-chain Nouns monitoring and analytics components\\n - 22 ETH to [@0xrayo](https://twitter.com/0xRayo) for the front end, back end, and analytics\\n\\nStart-up deployment and infrastructure costs will be covered under development costs. The website and infrastructure will be supported for a minimum of 1 year. Support after that period will fall under a seperate proposal and/or be left for community support.\\n\\nSettlement costs will not be included in this proposal. Normal settlement costs ~0.05 ETH, and fast inclusion may require additional payment for higher gas or Flashbots miner tips. Community donations will be solicited to support this expense.\\n\\n\\n## Miscellanea\\n\\n### Project Ethos\\nThe project code will be open sourced under GNU GPLv3 with all code shared on GitHub upon project completion. Our goal is to help the Nouns community build the best roster of Nouns possible, promote the Nouns project, and maximally expand the Nouns treasury by driving higher bids on attractive Nouns.\\n\\n### Limitations and Risks\\nNoun auction settlement can be performed by any user. While recent auctions have taken ~10 blocks (and community may accept longer), it's possible for a competing tool or mischevious user to settle the auction immediately or on an undesirable Noun. However, this is possible even without this project, and we can adjust our configuration to minimize the impact of this type of activity.\\n\\nSettlement on a specific block is also not guaranteed, and there may be situations where users vote for a Noun but settlement does not occur. There will be a tradeoff between settlement guarantee, time allowed for voting, and the transaction cost. We will optimize the whole system as much as possible in order to strike the best possible balance between these factors.\\n\\nThe project will require a balance of ETH to settle each auction. Community donations will be needed, after a brief testing period, for the tool to continue to be useful. In addition, gas fees on Ethereum are volatile, so we may need to skip settlement or pay very high fees if the network is congested at the time an auction ends.\\n","proposer":"0xAe7f458667f1B30746354aBC3157907d9F6FD15E","startBlock":13303556,"endBlock":13323266,"executed":true},"votes":[{"support":1,"voter":"0x008c84421dA5527F462886cEc43D2717B686A7e4","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x2573C60a6D127755aA2DC85e342F7da2378a0Cc5","numberOfVotes":6,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x75Ee6eb3d8DAcf41eE2e5307090B197D3E1Cca6E","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x43A330deC81bbd5E21f41c6B8354E54d481Efc93","numberOfVotes":6,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0xAe7f458667f1B30746354aBC3157907d9F6FD15E","numberOfVotes":5,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0xA387c87102fc0B51939d0CF9A86F7edd05291D5c","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""}]},{"prop":{"id":9,"description":"# Nouns Bidder POAP\n\nThis proposal is to fund the 1st half of the payment for the Nouns Bidder POAP Project that takes that project to its Season 1 completion. Upon successful completion, I will propose another Proposal to fund the 2nd half to compensate the team for their work.\n\n**Nouns Bidder POAP tl;dr**\n\nAs more and more people find out about Nouns and make their way to the main auction page, we wanted to propose a way to not only invite people to bid on Nouns, but to reward them for bidding as well. Our proposal, in order to bring about this excitement for bidding/settling, is to create a microsite/landing page where all people who have previously bid on, or settled, a Noun will have the ability to claim a free POAP, marking, on-chain, their involvement in and excitement for the Nouns community.\n\n**Resources**\n\n[Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MzVMFQO3do_2IBzSPup4QWyB48OoEdChZyAdOC74uak/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n[Nouns Discourse discussion](https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/proposal-nouns-bidder-poap/243)\n\n**Microsite/Landing Page Details**\n\nBelow you will find key details on the thought and tech behind how our team plans to tackle this project.\n\n**POAP (Proof Of Attendance Protocol) | What even is it?**\n\n* In the simplest of terms, POAP is a system that event organizers can use to distribute unique badges/NFTs (ERC-721 tokens) to people that show up to their event (whether physical or digital). It also provides an open standard for developers to build on.\n* Our team will be building out a microsite with the ability to claim a POAP for digitally attending (bidding on or settling) a Nouns Auction.\n* You will be able to have this badge, this NFT, in your wallet, showing publicly your involvement in the Nouns Auction process and your belief in the proliferation of the Nouns ecosystem.\n\n* We will be using etherscan.io data from the [Nouns DAO: Nouns Auction House Proxy](https://etherscan.io/address/0x830bd73e4184cef73443c15111a1df14e495c706) to pull all addresses with bid and settle functions from each auction in order to verify your involvement and allow you to claim your POAP through the site.\n* We will be leveraging the [poap.xyz](http://poap.xyz) platform and API in order to create the cleanest experience for the claimer.\n\n*AMENDMENT BEGINS*\n\n**POAP Claiming Threshold**\n\nThrough community feedback and concern, we have amended this proposal by adding a claiming threshold. The threshold is based on a runners-up bidding function.\n\n* A POAP will be rewarded/be able to be claimed by the five (5) runners-up for every auction (unique wallets only, back-and-forth bidding will not be rewarded with multiple POAPs)\n* There will also be one (1) POAP reserved for anyone who settles an auction.\n* The reasoning behind this amendment is for two key reasons.\n  * First: Having unlimited POAPs available with the only requirement being a bid, would open the door to countless spam bidders, resulting in the arbitrary burning of gas.\n  * Second: By restricting the POAPs to only be claimed by the 5 runners-up allows for the value of the POAP to stay in-line with that of Nouns, while still being attainable by a broader audience. If there is an auction that receives exceptionally high offers, the POAP reserved for a Settler, still allows for anyone, no matter the wallet size, to have the chance at receiving a Noun Bidders POAP.\n\n*AMENDMENT ENDS*\n\n**Technical Considerations + Source Code**\n\n* The tech stack will be Typescript, React, Next.js, and TailwindCSS\n* High emphasis on mobile-first usability and functional programming\n* Site will be deployed to Vercel and will use their CI/CD pipeline\n* Code will be open-sourced on Github so others can fork it and create their own POAP claim landing pages in the future\n* We will have both a staging and production site for testing & bug-prevention\n* Leverage the POAP API where possible ([poap.xyz](http://poap.xyz))\n\n**Design**\n\n**![|271x189](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/nouns/optimized/1X/4f768d722a0618ef433356ceba9900abafb7ca8b_2_271x189.jpeg)**\n* ***Design of the POAP***\n  * Nounish beings by Sun-Min + David\n  * Each Nounish being holds a numbered auction bid paddle marking in history the specific Noun that your bid was counted for\n* ***Design of the Microsite***\n  * Create wireframes in Figma and generate a low-fidelity interactive prototype (mobile and web)\n  * Upload prototype into maze.design and test with the nouns community/discord to ensure that key tasks can be completed\n  * Iterate on prototype to resolve any usability issues based on feedback\n  * Once wireframes are validated, we’ll conduct two rounds of visual design to and share back with community\n    * Leverage tailwind design components for easy and efficient build\n    * Comments will be enabled to review feedback asynchronously and directly in the design\n    * The website will be branded similarly to nouns.wtf (Londrina Solid font for headlines, Segoe UI for body text, grays and whites)\n\n**Project Timeline**\n\nOur team anticipates this project taking approximately 6-8 weeks.

Here's the final version of the Nouns Comic proposal.\n\n**Nouns and Storytelling.**\n\nIn a world where everything changes, humans have maintained one consistent feature and that’s the “**art of storytelling**”. Storytelling is and has been one of our favorite ways of communication, from cave-drawings and sharing tales of discovering fire to building the metaverse ~ we all want to share stories that we find interesting.\n\n**Why Comics?**\n\nNouns Comic are that fun and engaging tool that we can use to share our interest for Nouns and their exciting universe to build upon. It’s a way to keep that memetic consistency that we so desire to maintain inside the Nouns community/universe. An event, if you will, to gather around and enjoy the things happening in the community with a mixture of my wild imaginations about Nouns and how they’d interact with each other.\n\n**Nouns Comic you say?**\n\n“Nouns Comic #0” is already out and available for the community and all Noun enthusiasts. The full version can be found below.\n\n“Nouns Comic #0” serves as the “**WTF? Handbook**” which is a meme translation of the [Nouns website](https://nouns.wtf) while introducing different concepts like *Noun o’clock*, *Nouns treasury*, *Nouns’ art on-chain* and… in an amusing comedic way in “*internet language*”.\n\n[Nouns Comic #0](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/855538581434007635/894304410182746182/SPOILER_Nouns_Comic_0_-_Final.jpg)\n\n\nMoving forward, all comics will be available for ***free*** on the Nouns Comic website/archive to log the history of Nouns Comic. Everyone will have access to both *.jpeg* and *.pdf* versions of the comic and they will be accessible for everyone. Also, a very limited number of comics will be minted for collectors that are interested in owning a piece of Nouns Comic history that comes with the animated version of the cover.\n\n**Budget and Timeframe**\n\n* 10 days per comic\n* 0.5 ETH per comic\n* Lasting for 3 months (9 issues)\n\nThat will bring the total to **4.5ETH** for **9 upcoming issues** over the span of **3 months** (90 days) to be synced with **Party Nouns** (Nouns ending with 1). \n\nNotes:\n- The comics will be extended over the 3 months period if agreed upon by both parties ~ details will be discussed in a future proposal.\n- 25% of the initial revenue generated from “special editions” will go back to the NounsDAO treasury.\n\n**Proof of Work?**\n\nUndead Oracle here ~ Artist and content-creator focused on internet culture and visual storytelling through art.

A Fitz Frames membership includes two complete pairs of prescription eyeglasses with unlimited replacement frames should they lose, break, grow out of the glasses, or their prescription changes.\\nIn addition to their Fitz Frames Membership each child will receive an additional free pair of Noun Frames, glasses that mimic the pair worn by their favorite Noun.\\nAs an initial pilot program, we propose Nouns DAO allocate **9ETH** (~$30,000 worth of ETH) to provide glasses to approximately 300 kids (aprox $100) per child. This will be done with in conjunction with our outreach partner Vision to Learn in an initial focus geography (probably Ohio and/or Detroit). Progress reports will be given to NounsDAO on an ongoing basis, but no less than once a quarter. The pilot program is expected to run approximately 90 days, but children will continue to receive replacement glasses for the full year as needed. The purpose of the pilot program is to validate and refine the offering and delivery process, with the goal of expanding the efforts nationwide and eventually internationally.\\nAt the end of the initial pilot program, Fitz present the results of the program and will put to a vote either a continuation, expansion, or termination of the program.\\nAdditionally, we request **2ETH** in one-time funding to build outreach materials (print, animation, and website) directed towards schools to explain the program, Nouns, Fitz, and the underlying technology of blockchain, NFTs, and additive manufacturing.\\n\\n**Proposal**\\nFitz would like to eventually build to a perpetual funding mechanism in order to expand our existing social good efforts and deliver eyewear on an ongoing basis to kids in need. In the interim, we’d like to propose a pilot program to prove out the model and refine delivery mechanism:\\n- $30K allocation from Nouns treasury to provide approximately 300 no-cost vision tests plus Fitz Frames memberships to kids in need, initially in a limited geographical focus area.\\n- Fitz will provide annual memberships at cost of $100)/kid/year discounted from $185.  Annual Membership consists of two pairs of custom fit glasses plus unliminted replacements.\\n- Fitz will provide an additional free pair of Noun Frames, mimicking their favorite Nouns, limited to an initial selection of 10 Noun options for the Pilot Program.\\n- Vision to Learn, will identify recipients and provide no-cost eye exams within the geographical focus area. Initial prospects are Ohio and Detroit.\\n- Initial Pilot Program is expected to run approximately 90 days, at which point Fitz will present a report of progress to the NounsDAO.\\n- At that point the NounsDAO can vote to expand, continue, or suspend the pilot program.\\n- Based on findings from the initial Pilot Program, elements can be refined including: delivery mechanism, offering, and outreach. Additionally, Fitz Frames will work to try and secure additional underwriting in order to extend the reach of the program. (possibly through Medicaid reimbursement, or local philanthropic partners)\\n\\n- In order to promote the program (and help surface Nouns to a wider public awareness) we propose dedicating an additional 2ETH to develop outreach materials including print, short form animation, and a dedicated website. This will target schools, the student recipients of glasses, and broader public. In addition to promotion of the program, this is an opportunity to introduce the technology elements underpinning both Nouns and Fitz Frames, and develop age-appropriate STEM curriculum for the kids who receive the glasses.\\nNouns is a fantastic example of people leveraging technology to come together and build long-term value in perpetuity.  Fitz leverages the power of technology to change the lives of kids. We think this is a natural partnership that would not only do a tremendous amount of good, but could serve as tangible application of blockchain doing tangible good. At Fitz, we believe that those who can see the world are the ones who can change the world. NounsDAO embodies this ethos completely, and we couldn’t imagine a better partner.\\n\\n**Noun Frames**\\nFitz will integrate Nouns Frames into their application so that users can pick their favorite Noun and receive glasses that mimic those frames as well as have the Noun itself printed on the side of the frames as well as the Noun number printed on the inside.\\n\\n\\n**About Fitz:**\\nFitz Frames: https://www.fitzframes.com/ \\nFitz for Good - how Fitz has worked with VTL to provide glasses for kids in the past:\\n https://vimeo.com/377468371 \\n\\nHow Fitz has worked with Healthcare community to provide protective prescription eyewear to drs and nurses across the country - https://news.yahoo.com/local-hero-nyc-glasses-maker-171104609.html \\n\\nFitz in the Press - How we came to be and why we matter to kids - https://abcnews.go.com/Business/startup-offers-affordable-eyeglasses-kids-flatter-faces/story?id=65014415 \\n\\n**About Vision 2 Learn:**\\nhttps://visiontolearn.org/about/from-the-founder/ \\n","proposer":"0xAe7f458667f1B30746354aBC3157907d9F6FD15E","startBlock":13460459,"endBlock":13480169,"executed":true},"votes":[{"support":1,"voter":"0x2E5CcFfbAe934a9Cb7e061Fca7Af01946e4E550E","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x6f9e3976fa3b5b22761fe5D635E1f0d9d9aeB85d","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0xf476Cd75BE8Fdd197AE0b466A2ec2ae44Da41897","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x75Ee6eb3d8DAcf41eE2e5307090B197D3E1Cca6E","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x48e3E06520fF208746B8555076f7AF3E71Af1A4F","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x33DaF8e90Cd1f214CC25A1865649e847254F2ece","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x6c0Cf880cB20EefabFB09341Fba9e2Bd29ad3DFA","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0xA387c87102fc0B51939d0CF9A86F7edd05291D5c","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x2573C60a6D127755aA2DC85e342F7da2378a0Cc5","numberOfVotes":7,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0xAe7f458667f1B30746354aBC3157907d9F6FD15E","numberOfVotes":5,"reason":""}]},{"prop":{"id":13,"description":"# Retroactive Funding and Small Grants Pool\n\n> *tl;dr -- Encourage creators (artists and devs) to build with Nouns by having a pool of funds held in a Safe for this purpose.

Despite this, many Nouns community members have added to the ecosystem and it would be great to honor their contribution.\n\nTo solve both of these issues, we'd like to propose that a pool of capital be sent to a Nouners controlled Safe. A Safe is much quicker mechanism to coordinate and distribute funds. We would like 20 ETH to pilot the pool, with a suggested range of 0.25-2 ETH per project, with the aim of:\n\n1. acknowledging, through retroactive funding, past contributions to the Nouns ecosystem\n1. granting funds for the development of small, one-off, or alpha version projects\n1. encouraging building and signalling that retroactive funding is a viable way to build on Nouns\n\n\n### Funding Committee\nThe initial signing committee on the Safe will be:\n- ![](https://bafkreiagjoe5qu3mcl37dwki2vp4fj4gb7kccmflsn2aaf7tzomoe7kw7a.ipfs.dweb.link/) Noun 12\n- ![](https://bafkreiffeqnv4rgab7e5o6vmn77ybkp3iuvcgjfu64lpu7yixiwhp7y3ty.ipfs.dweb.link/) Noun 16\n- ![](https://bafkreigj6v7xwubod6ustllhc5jjrhpeggzsyrmjodvqgq47zshzh2l3xi.ipfs.dweb.link/) Noun 22\n- ![](https://bafkreifald3ya6i62qy3s2mfefbzxnnkb25wazvqlnco3nr4xzuq6a7pae.ipfs.dweb.link/) Noun 32\n- ![](https://bafkreiaalajwukk3wfocjcbl6a7uufkcsepeerhvunmnyjewfhnipqn2v4.ipfs.dweb.link/) Nouns DAO\n\nThe Safe will require `2 of 4` Nouners to sign, with Nouns DAO acting as a largely symbolic owner and backup.\n\nThe committee will monitor the builder community, retroactively fund previous work as it comes up, and receive informal requests/applications for small project grants.

Proposal to name a recently discovered species of glass frog after Nouns\n\nI have been informed of an opportunity to name a species of glass frog newly discovered in the Dracula nature reserve in Ecuador. The EcoMinga Foundation (EcoMinga Foundation) is raising funds alongside its partner Rainforest Trust (www.rainforesttrust.org 2) in exchange for the right to name this glass frog.\n\nI’d like to propose that NounsDAO pay 25 ETH to purchase the right to name the frog Hyalinobatrachium Nouns, or Nouns Glassfrog in plain English. As far as I know, naming a species would be a first for the crypto and NFT community. Frogs have memetic value in the NFT community, making this species an appropriate choice for naming. Not only would this story be likely to get picked up by the press and social media, but the money goes to the cause of protecting biodiversity and rainforests.\n\nHere is a link to some photos of the frog, and the scientific write up of the frog's discovery (along with another similar frog). https://www.dropbox.com/sh/w5kmr9hyzvlxjwo/AABrxnch8PAYop8MQ-FTrozEa?dl=0\n\nThe breakdown of the use of funds would be roughly the following, subject to discussions with the non-profits:\n55% to Ecominga for operating and protecting the reserve\n5% to scientific publishing and discovery of new species\n40% to Rainforest Trust’s Climate Action Fund, which funds protection of rainforest to sequester carbon\n\nOnce this proposal passes and the ETH gets sent, I'll calculate the equivalent USD amount and wire the fiat to Rainforest Trust within 5 business days (unfortunately the non-profit doesn't accept crypto donations). Rainforest Trust will then pass on Ecominga's portion to them.

Scope for these contributions is considered open-ended, and will be defined on a monthly cadence with the input of the Nounders & the community. This proposal seeks to bring on three individuals with deep interest in the Nouns ecosystem, and a proven track record of delivering value on short timelines & at an early stage.\n\n### Context\n\nAs part of their original contributions, the Nounders built [Nouns.wtf](http://Nouns.wtf), home to daily Noun auctions, governance, an exploratory playground, and details of the project and its motivations. Given the rapid increase in interest and usage of the Nouns products, we propose bringing on world-class design & engineering resourcing to help iterate on the future of [Nouns.wtf](http://Nouns.wtf).\n\nMany Nounders remain involved in varying capacities in day-to-day community affairs, but the demands of the role are non-trivial and [critical to the success of any DAO](https://twitter.com/punk4156/status/1450990370528141315?s=20). We propose bringing on a talented community lead who will help strengthen the sense of shared purpose within the Nouns community.\n\n### Scope\n\nScope for these contributors will be defined on an on-going basis with input from Nounders, Noun owners, and the greater Nouns community. Contributors will be expected to communicate their deliverables & timelines in a public manner at least once per month. \n\nFor the design & engineering roles, the initial set of scope includes maintenance and improvements to [Nouns.wtf](http://Nouns.wtf). For the community role, contributions include (but are not limited to) scheduling & leading community calls, internal & external communications, Discord management, and onboarding of new DAO members.\n\n### Expectations\n\nContributors are responsible for documenting and communicating their decisions & output. Updates should be shared early and often, encouraging Nounders and community members to provide input given the shared vision for the Nouns ecosystem. Contributors are expected to be responsive, but are free to define the working style which lends itself to the best outcomes. The commitments will last for **3 months**, or 90 days, after which point this proposal will be resubmitted to extend the working relationship.\n\n### Contributors\n\nInformation on the contributors is available in [this post](https://discord.com/channels/849745721544146955/898682149585162270/907593435417038889) in #private on the Nouns Discord.\n\n### Compensation\n\nWe believe that the NounsDAO could fund this proposal, decreasing the burden of project maintenance on the Nounders and increasing the lifespan of product & community development for the community. For this initial trial, compensation will be paid out via streaming payments on Sablier. Each contributor will be paid `~5.9 ETH` per month, for approximately three months, or `~17.69 ETH` over 91 days. In the case of poor performance, the `cancelStream` method may be invoked, returning funds to an escrow and the contributor(s) pro-rata based on time elapsed.\n\nThe proposal also includes a transfer of `0.22 ETH` to [0x75ee6eb3d8dacf41ee2e5307090b197d3e1cca6e](https://etherscan.io/address/0x75ee6eb3d8dacf41ee2e5307090b197d3e1cca6e) as reimbursement for submitting the on-chain

Let’s make it happen and find out!\n\nTo contribute to the elevation of Nouns to cultural icon status, broaden the scope and understanding of what the Nouns characters can be, and also to encourage contribution and interactivity in Nouns-art-making, we will create 4 short films centered around Nouns.\n\nWe will explore the creative potential of Nouns by making each film with totally different genres and techniques. From this we will learn what works, what doesn’t, and inform what motion strategies we should explore next.\n\nThese short films will be the first of their kind, and hopefully will inspire other creators from the broader community to generate more motion projects featuring the Nouns.\n\nThis is just a first step to dip Nouns’ toes in the water of motion storytelling and for us all to learn. We have grand ideas for how this first step can seed one or potentially many Nouns content projects, including but not limited to: creating even more elevated Nouns content, creating a platform for Nouns in motion (or Nouns art generally), an ongoing narrative series, curated anthologies from artists around the world, and community-contributed storytelling.\n\n**The Films**\nWe want to cover as many genres and techniques as possible to be able to experiment and learn from how Nouns translate into all these different outcomes. Ideally, no two films will cover the same ground. Let’s explore...\n\n**Genres:** drama, comedy, experimental, family, action, adventure, romance, adventure, musical, thriller...\n\n**Medium / Technique:** Pixel art, traditional 2D animation, 3D animation, stop-motion, live action, puppetry, augmented reality...\n\nAward winning hybrid production company Pixel and web3 media collective StudioDAO will form the Nouns Stories team and collaborate to create all 4 films. Each film will have a different director but may share some production team members.\n\n**Distribution & Sale**\nWe are currently thinking about releasing one film per week for a month in 2022 (but are open to suggestions or ideas on this). It would be great to premiere them at noun'o'clock every monday for example The films will be made as accessible as possible and shared for free, potentially on many networks and platforms. We believe Nouns content should not be gatekept, our goal should be to reach the largest audience possible (and encourage others to do so).\n\nThe films themselves will be CC0 and everyone will be encouraged to use them however they wish. NounsStories team may decide that its a good idea to enter the films into festivals or other events or platforms around the world to increase both reach and gain prestige. The films shall always remain accessible online (and free) however, and we should not ever conform to any requests to pull them down in order to participate in an event (some film festivals may require this in order to screen at their events).\n\nThe films might also be minted as NFTs, ideally on a custom NounsStories contract, and auctioned off (and pending the level of success, perhaps assets, elements from the production, or offshoot artwork and content could be minted too). Ideally the royalites from these sales would go to the artists that are responsible for the film's creation.\n\n**Contributors & Compensation**\n* 7 ETH for the production of each film\n* 28 ETH total\n\n\n**Pixel**\n* Role: Nouns Stories Creative Direction team + Production Company on 3 films + Marketing and festivals\n* Compensation: 21 ETH\n* Wallet: 0x5184782cC00E90D2E0C82A8f22729f7f38a572B8\n* Handle: @goldypix (on behalf of Pixel)\n\n**StudioDAO**\n* Role: Nouns Stories Creative Direction team + Production Company on 1 films\n* Compensation: 7 ETH\n* Wallet: 0x09907f01d6192192f767deFB01C7Ee10cF82c24c\n* Handle: @studioDao\n\n**Project Timeline**\n\n* Development and Pre Production: 2 months\n* Production & Post Production: 2 months\n* Film Launch: 1 per week for 1 month\n\n\n**Meet the NounStories Team**\n**Pixel**\nAs a production company, Pixel has been creating award winning short form content for over a decade. We’re a highly collaborative team of producers, writers, directors, designers, animators, and technicians, that specialises in all things hybrid and animation.\n\nFollowing the success of Goldy’s acclaimed stop motion short film Lost and Found, we created the Original Content department at Pixel, with the sole focus on creating beautiful and meaningful narrative work, with a unique aesthetic that is intimately connected to the story we’re telling.\n\n**Goldy**\nGoldy, is an Oscar® shortlisted, Annie nominated, Australian Academy, Directors Guild, and Webby award-winning director and co-owner of hybrid production company [Pixel](https://www.pixel.melbourne/directors/goldy/). His heartfelt stop motion short film [Lost & Found](https://youtu.be/35i4zTky9pI?t=16), has been viewed over 10 million times online, bringing tears to the eyes of a global audience.\n\nGoldy has been an active member of the Nouns community since its formation, with a compulsion for finding small ways to tell stories with Nouns, from Nouns movie trivia games, to poetry, comic strips, remixing imagery of daily Noun auctions, and his own art derivative project. Goldy is also a founding member of SharkDAO, an admin of the Shark discord, and is the current representative of SharkDAO on the Nouns server.\n\n**studiodao**\nStudiodao’s mission is to develop a protocol that empowers creators to finance and control their own work, eliminating the restrictive features inherent in the standard practices of centralized media companies.\n\nstudiodao is redefining the role and popular notion of ‘studio’ and creating a new value proposition for creators and fans in entertainment and sports -- driven by the adoption of NFTs in 2021 and beyond.\n\n**kenbot a.k.a Kenny Miller**\nA creative and entrepreneurial leader, kenbot develops brands that target white spaces in digital media and the businesses that make them sustainable and disruptive.\n\nFrom the launch of Quicktime to video games, social networking, user-generated content, streaming media, dynamic ad models, and now NFTs, Kenny’s focus has always been on engaging audiences. This path has led to iconic work for culture-defining brands such as Apple, Disney, Nickelodeon, Sesame Street, MTV, The Walking Dead, Netflix, and the New York Knicks. His work has connected deeply with users of all ages worldwide.\n\nKenny has been an active member of the Nouns community from rinkeby, is a founding member of SharkDAO, and the founder of studiodao.\n\n[Previous Discussion on Discourse](https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/proposal-nouns-stories/308)","proposer":"0xAe7f458667f1B30746354aBC3157907d9F6FD15E","startBlock":13679128,"endBlock":13698838,"executed":true},"votes":[{"support":1,"voter":"0x008c84421dA5527F462886cEc43D2717B686A7e4","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x6f9e3976fa3b5b22761fe5D635E1f0d9d9aeB85d","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x696ed7b26f4B019CEeC78DC8b9140ad64A6f354B","numberOfVotes":9,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0xAca3b4110403F3c4dacb35A7B3Aa0a84eFb6A3e9","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0xAe7f458667f1B30746354aBC3157907d9F6FD15E","numberOfVotes":5,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x75Ee6eb3d8DAcf41eE2e5307090B197D3E1Cca6E","numberOfVotes":2,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x83fCFe8Ba2FEce9578F0BbaFeD4Ebf5E915045B9","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x4680cb63563472cac10236C07d288580D8d7B52A","numberOfVotes":3,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0xa555d1Ee16780B2d414eD97f4f169c0740099615","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x43A330deC81bbd5E21f41c6B8354E54d481Efc93","numberOfVotes":9,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x2573C60a6D127755aA2DC85e342F7da2378a0Cc5","numberOfVotes":11,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x14dFDd3613054dDB14AF2Fa51c8a75E17dADe764","numberOfVotes":2,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0xA387c87102fc0B51939d0CF9A86F7edd05291D5c","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""}]},{"prop":{"id":21,"description":"# A Very Nounish Gitcoinmas NFT Crossover Event\n\n*Written by Noun 12 but he can't propose because there's only 1 Live Proposal per proposing address at a time.*\n\nThe proposal is for Nouns DAO to become a matching partner to the tune of 169 ETH for the Gitcoin Grants Round 12 starting December 1st. We will also commission the artists behind the successful Gitcoin Moonshot Bot NFTs to make a series of 5 Moonshot Nouns, 1 of which will be auctioned over the course of the round with the proceeds going to Gitcoin general fund, and 4 of which will go to winners that the Nouns community selects from each GR12 category (Climate, Advocacy, Longevity, Ethereum), in a limited edition NFT crossover event.\n\n[Discourse Discussion for A Very Nounish Gitcoinmas](https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/proposal-a-very-nounish-gitcoinmas-nft-crossover-event-169-eth-to-crypto-public-goods/369)\n\n**What's Gitcoin?**\n\n* Gitcoin is a crypto-native public goods funding and open source jobs & coordination platform successfully built and spun out of Consensys into a DAO with its own ERC-20 ($GTC). [Gitcoin has raised $40 million for open source and public goods funding in its lifetime](https://gitcoin.co/results).  One popular Gitcoin feature has been quarterly funding rounds for grants to public goods and open source projects that are accompanied with quadratic matching by sponsors.  That quadratic matching is designed to assess both the quantity and quality of support that a given project gets, creating an effective way of measuring dollar voting without descending into plutocracy.  These rounds, the energy and money they incubated for public goods, have been a great success for the Ethereum community in general.  Gitcoin has raised tens of millions of dollars through their GRs alone.\n* [Vitalik on Gitcoin](https://vitalik.ca/general/2019/10/24/gitcoin.html) \n* [Gitcoin GR12](https://gitcoin.co/blog/announcing-grants-round-12/)\n* [Vitalik on Quadratic payments](https://vitalik.ca/general/2019/12/07/quadratic.html)\n* [Radical Markets, an overview of Radical Democracy tools like quadatic funding applied to solve economic and other problems](https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691177502/radical-markets)\n* [Lemonade Stand, A handy guide to financial support for open source](https://github.com/nayafia/lemonade-stand)\n\n**How does Nouns DAO benefit?**\n\n\n* **Fund the public goods from which we were created and on which are future depends.** Who's going to build the roads? We are.\n* **Signal to the Ethereum, crypto, open source, and builder communities that our ethos aligns with theirs.**  We will be the one of largest matching partners, if not the #1. [The Ethereum Foundation is giving $500k specifically for the Advocacy category](https://blog.ethereum.org/2021/11/16/advocacy-grants/) for example.\n* **Make it normative for DAOs to support both crypto and real world public goods just as part of their DNA.**  Everyone benefits from this, it's a good seed for open source crypto and decentralized organizations, because we are and always will be all in this together.  We're leaders, let's lead.\n* **Marketing to the types of creators and builders we want to attract for Nouns proposal that we are open for business.** Gitcoin projects have huge overlap with the types of projects and creators we would consider funding. It's a large gm to them all.\n* **Demonstration that business should be sealed with NFT miscegenation and crossover events**. In this case, between Noun DAO's NFT and Gitcoin's.  Who knows what this type of NFT-rooted relationship could evolve into but there's memetic consistency in sealing a deal with an NFT crossover event.  Worst case, we have created more fun symbolically important art.  Best case it creates deeper ways to engage and collaborate with fellow DAOs or boomer organizations like Arby's.\n\n**Moonshot Nouns**\n* These will be 5 NFTs, made and managed on the Gitcoin side with input from the Nouns side.\n* Will feature both Moonshot Bot and Nounish elements in some fashion.  Obviously, the most distinctive Nounish element are our glasses but there's also the distinctive heads which could be of use.  Artist may make a themed one for each category (Climate, Advocacy, Longevity, Ethereum) and then one uber-one. \n* The uber-one NFT will be auctioned on the 1st or 2nd of the round with an auction set to end on the 2nd to last day of the Round (December 11th).  Auction will be promoted on both Nouns and Gitcoin side. Proceeds will go to Gitcoin general fund or multisig.\n* The category Moonshot Noun NFTs will be doled out to a champion from each category, determined by a process we run on the Nouns side.  Likely a small Nouns team will pick the top 10 projects in each category and then put it up for vote to the public. Potentially we can create a polling page on Nouns.wtf to drive engagement directly to our home rather than Twitter.  TBD.\n* This is all subject to change if a better NFT crossover path and strategy emerge in process or it become unworkable.\n\n * [Decrypt on Moonshot Bot launch](https://decrypt.co/79606/moonshot-bots-nfts-gitcoin-ethereum-grants-1-8-million)\n* [Moonshot Bots](https://bots.moonshotcollective.space/)\n* [Moonshot Collective](https://moonshotcollective.space/)\n\n\n![E9f3Y__VUAg47fL|690x349](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/nouns/optimized/1X/9c6985a26194d4e43142051f595aa90d93c95f96_2_690x349.jpeg)\n\n**Steps and Timing**\n\n1.

At the end of each auction, Noun owners (Nouners) vote on which proposal gets funded.\n\nThis proposal aims to be the MVP for a trustless on-chain solution.\n\n### Why?\nThe NounsDAO treasury is accruing capital at a $100M+ annual run rate. While NounsDAO has pushed several proposals through to execution, the current funding process does not seem like the optimal approach to scaling to thousands of projects. Prop House is an exploration of an alternative funding mechanism: forced treasury spend that minimizes friction to propose while maintaining quality via Nouns DAO member votes.\n\n#### Forced treasury spend\nIf the underlying thesis behind Nouns DAO is that the more a meme is spread, the more its provenance is worth, then spending the treasury to proliferate Nouns 1 makes a lot of sense. Assuming there is ongoing supply of ideas to proliferate Nouns, Prop House aims to force perpetual spend to capture this supply.\n\n#### Minimizing friction\nAnyone who wants to build on Nouns 2 is encouraged to do so. To this end, there is documentation and guidance to help builders get funded as quickly as possible. Still, proposing to the DAO involves friction. It means joining a new community, proposing an idea, getting sponsorship, achieving community consensus and more. The process can take a week or more before proposing on-chain which takes yet another week. Prop House could alleviate some of this friction by redirecting focus to the proposal itself instead of other functions.\n\n#### Quality\nAssuming that being able to amass the significant amount of capital required to buy a Noun is correlated to being a good capital allocator, NounsDAO members represent a pool of intellectual capital that could be used as a quality filter for the best use of the Prop House auction funds.\n\n### How would it work?\nFunds requested from the DAO would be sent to a 2/3 safe controlled by cryptoseneca, devcarrot and Pixelz. The funds would be used to run three auctions of varying amounts and run times, for example:\n\n* 5 ETH with a 7 day proposal and 3 day voting period.\n* 10 ETH with a 14 day proposal and 3 day voting period.\n* 20 ETH with a 21 day proposal and 3 day voting period.\n\nThe differing amounts and run times are to test which scale (if any) is best suited for the format.\n\nA web app will be built as the home for the project where both auctions and voting will take place. Auctions will run for their allotted time, allowing anyone to bid with a proposal. The consecutive voting period will have Nouners vote for the proposal of their choice. At the end of the voting period, the funds will be transferred to the proposal with the most votes.\n\n### Funds Requested\nThis proposal requests a total of 36 ETH from the DAO:\n\n* 35 ETH to fund three auctions.\n* 1 ETH for operational spend\n\n### Who is behind this proposal?\nseneca, one of the Nouns project founders. I will be building Prop House alongside devcarrot (Nounder) and Pixelz (designer) with help from the rest of the Nounders.\n\n### Mock Up\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/ZRDauGe.png)\n\n\n### Other Considerations\nProp House aims to be the MVP of a trustless on-chain solution. If the experiment succeeds, the next logical step would be to build an unopinionated suite of contracts that automate the process.\n\nConceptually, the contracts could be the seed to a crypto native Y Combinator model. Where as before you had partners, now you have DAO members. Instead of summer and winter batches, you have weekly or monthly cadences. And instead of demographic restrictions for applicants, you have anyone with an Ethereum wallet. It might be the case that breaking thresholds in the categories mentioned above transforms the model to something completely different.","proposer":"0x2573C60a6D127755aA2DC85e342F7da2378a0Cc5","startBlock":13725563,"endBlock":13745273,"executed":true},"votes":[{"support":1,"voter":"0x696ed7b26f4B019CEeC78DC8b9140ad64A6f354B","numberOfVotes":10,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x3dbDF1a202d21aaC3309d91dAcFCEF84B8873f7a","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x14dFDd3613054dDB14AF2Fa51c8a75E17dADe764","numberOfVotes":2,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x43A330deC81bbd5E21f41c6B8354E54d481Efc93","numberOfVotes":9,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x01dB485f57Dc000E761b85641F78C9D212A2eEaB","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x91dCCAA260CC4616E1a6e6b693DB7207C5E42937","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x008c84421dA5527F462886cEc43D2717B686A7e4","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x75Ee6eb3d8DAcf41eE2e5307090B197D3E1Cca6E","numberOfVotes":2,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x2573C60a6D127755aA2DC85e342F7da2378a0Cc5","numberOfVotes":12,"reason":""}]},{"prop":{"id":24,"description":"# Noun Tracks - Unlocking the sounds of Nouns\n\n\nAuthors: Arpeggi Labs, Nate Fox & Joshua Fisher.\n\n## **TL;DR**\nNoun Tracks are the fully on-chain 1:1 CC0 theme songs of a Noun created using Arpeggi Labs' on-chain DAW with samples and patterns performed and written by Nate Fox.\n\nTogether we will develop and launch Noun Tracks.  These NFT's are claimable for Nouners plus all the tools will be public and sounds will be compeletely CC0 for the community to enjoy.\n\n## **How?**\n### Part 1 - The Noun Track Stack\nNouns have a stack of visual characteristics that make them unique, with Noun Tracks now they have their own sounds too!\n\nNoun Tracks contain a 1:1 sonic representation of every layer of a Noun. \n\nEach visible layer of the Noun corresponds to a unique component of the song:\n\n\n**Layer 1 - Backgrounds (2)** - Key, either Major or Minor.\n\n```\nKey_Background {\n    boolean major;\n} \n```\n\n**Layer 2 - Bodies (30)** - Chord Progressions containing unique Bass & Harmony patterns and samples. These correspond to the \"body\" of the song.\n\n```\nChordProgression_Bodies {\n\tPattern bass;\n\tPattern harmony;\n\tSample bassSample;\n    Sample harmonySample;\n}\t\n```\n\n**Layer 3 - Accessories (137)** - Drum Loops containing unique snare, hat, percussion and kick patterns and samples. These provide a nice \"accessory\" to the other melodic components to the song.\n\n```\nDrumLoop_Accessory {\n    Pattern kick.\n    Pattern snare;\n    Pattern hat;\n    Pattern perc;\n    Sample kickSample;\n    Sample snareSample; \n    Sample hatSample;\n    Sample percSample;\n}\n```\n\n**Layer 4 - Heads (234)** - Lead Sample and Sound Effects. 234 Sample + Sound Effect combinations give each Noun. \nThese custom Lead Samples plus fun FX Sample moments give each Noun Track a distinctive personality. For example, Nouns with the shark head will have a shark chomp sound effect!\n\n```\nFX_Heads {\n    Sample lead;\t\n    Pattern fx;\n    Sample fxSample;\n} \n```\n\n**Layer 5 - Glasses (21 patterns)** - Lead Pattern, aka the musical notation of the Lead Sample produced by Nate.\n\n```\nLead_Glasses {\n\tPattern lead;\n}\n```\n\n\n\n### Part 2 - Construction of a Noun Track\nOnce an auction is settled and a new Noun appears a new Noun Track is created and minted! \n\nUsing a custom \"Noun Track Creation Contract\" Arpeggi will pull the correspoding Samples and Patterns from the current Nouns features to create each days Noun Track. \n\n**Example Noun Track**\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SJaT7N4OY.png)\n\n[![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/ryOUougFt.png)](https://vimeo.com/647873210)\n\n\n\n```\nNoun_Track {\n\tKey_Background key;\n    ChordProgression_Bodies chords;\n    DrumLoop_Accessory drums;\n    FX_Heads fx;\n    Lead_Glasses lead;\n}\n```\n\n\n\n\n**Additional Noun Tracks Samples**\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HJbJ4ENut.png)\n\n[![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SJyni_xFt.png)](https://vimeo.com/647873573)\n\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rydSUNEOF.png)\n\n[![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/Syc0odgKt.png)](https://vimeo.com/647873417)\n\n\n(*please note that this was created using a BETA Version of Arpeggi Nouns where Percussion field was used or FX.  The final version will have greater flexibility)\n\n### Part 3 - Minting & Distribution \n\nEvery Noun has a corresponding Noun Track that can be claimed by the Noun owner. A Nouner simply connects the wallet to NounTracks.wtf and they can claim their corresponding Noun Track.\n\nIn addtion to the NFT being minted the Noun Track will be simultaneously uploaded w/ it's Noun artwork to the traditional music DSP's and platforms. Using a platform such as Revelator's on-chain IP rights management system the royalties generated will be split between NounsDAO, the Nouner, and the creators at 33.3% each. \n\nDon't worry if you don't own a Noun.

And with the result - a uniquely wearable Nounish 3D-printed fashion collection - Nouns and NounsDAO story can proliferate and get known with new audiences (like, more women, 3d printing enthusiasts, digital fashionistas, fashion students, and more!)\n\n**How will the collection proliferate Nouns?**\n\nI wanted to touch on this because it's the key question: how will people hear about this? how will this get attention?\n\nMy two last big collections, the 2015 [\"Liberty Leading the People\" 1](https://tinyurl.com/yt6dj264) and the 2017 [\"Birth of Venus](https://danitpeleg.com/the-birth-of-venus/)\", both received incredible amounts of press coverage. Why? because they both had strong underlying stories. The Liberty collection was a \"first\" - it was the first 3D printed fashion collection printed entirely at home, and the Birth collection was based on the 3D printed dress I [made for the Paralympics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xcvYRjWdfyU), and also it contained the first commercially available [3D printed jacket](https://danitpeleg.com/product/create-your-own-3d-printed-jacket/).\n\n![danit-peleg-venus-1_(1)1800×1008 183 KB](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/nouns/original/1X/4a4ddc3a75d3493d6859cb613d453922ff589842.jpeg)\n\n![WhatsApp_Image_2021-11-02_at_1.33.55_PM1600×857 219 KB](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/nouns/original/1X/11f4fea59fd76560d03d3fd969035d83e7ea6cfe.jpeg)\n\nThe Nouns + Innovative tech + Fashion angle will surely fascinate many. A good story will be crafted, and I am sure that this collection will get a lot of attention because it is touching on all the most fascinating topics of our times: cryptoculture, 3D printing, digital fashion, AR etc'\n\n**So, what are the phases required to produce a 3D-printed fashion collection?**\n\n1.  **Research** - Inspiration board, material research, printing samples\n2.  **Design** - sketches (and more sketches)\n3.  **Modeling** - 3D modeling the sketches into 3D-printable files (working with **zeeraffe)**\n4.  **Print testing** - testing many different types of printers, configurations, materials etc\n5.  **Printing finals** - printing the entire collection\n6.  **Assembling** - using different techniques (e.g. gluing, knotting, etc) to assemble the collection together\n7.  **Photoshoot** (with real-life models) - for press materials, websites, AR filter etc\n8.  **Runway show** - either invited to showcase at an event like nft.nyc, fashion weeks etc'\n9.  **Marketing** - prepare press kit, the collection get PR, is booked for events, and showcases galleries & museums\n\n**Budget & next steps**\n\nTo kickoff phases 1+2, I am asking **3.15 ETH** so I can commit to start the creative process, defining the technology I need to use as well as developing a detailed budget.\n\n**Deliverables for this first phase:**\n* Creating a full sketchbook of what I envision the collection will look like\n* A robust budget for phases 4-9 that can then be presented to the community for feedback.\n\nJust to give a sense of the sizing of this project to reduce uncertainty --- and it really all depends on the type of technologies we will use for printing (e.g. polyjet is MUCH more expensive than FDM) --- I estimate a full fashion collection can be done for **$80K-150K.**\n\n![https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/nouns/optimized/1X/9a898527788f6f81df411e5d32a0b5a10ab083dd_2_244x400.jpeg](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/nouns/optimized/1X/9a898527788f6f81df411e5d32a0b5a10ab083dd_2_244x400.jpeg)  ![https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/nouns/optimized/1X/d3a3cc6a176310931bd8351c6f3e191148302495_2_276x142.jpeg](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/nouns/optimized/1X/d3a3cc6a176310931bd8351c6f3e191148302495_2_276x142.jpeg) ![https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/nouns/optimized/1X/3e73dd086b1500552ad124d0bfd3629b0a719ec5_2_108x375.jpeg](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/nouns/optimized/1X/3e73dd086b1500552ad124d0bfd3629b0a719ec5_2_108x375.jpeg)\n\n*A 3D printed noun sample of textile idea and a sketch of one of the outfits*\n\n![https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/nouns/original/1X/7a10dea807982fcc6c42bdbdf2fa9028a53ebeb3.gif](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/nouns/original/1X/7a10dea807982fcc6c42bdbdf2fa9028a53ebeb3.gif)\n*A 3d-printed fabric I created in the past year, I would like to use this tech in this collection*\n\nFor this project, I will be collaborating with Zeeraffe, a 3D Modeller and Developer who created [Turn a Noun](https://opensea.io/collection/turnanoun).\n\n\n*A bit more about me:*\nI’m a 3D printed fashion designer. I recently filed 2 patents about soft 3D printable materials. I believe that 3D printing opens up fascinating new opportunities in fashion, combined with the power of NFTs my vision of downloading and printing clothes is closer than ever.\n\nIn 2018, I was recognized as one of Europe’s Top Women in Tech by Forbes. In 2019, the BBC named me as one of the 100 most inspiring and influential women in the world. In 2021 I opened the first 3D printable fashion NFTs store. I was fascinated to learn about the nouns movement and want to contribute so I can learn more about how the DAO is operating from first hand. I’m passionate about making this innovative collection inspired by the cool nouns!\n\nYou can read more about me here: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danit_Peleg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danit_Peleg)\n\n[Previous discussions & more details on Discourse](https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/nouns-3d-printed-fashion-collection/402)\n","proposer":"0x01dB485f57Dc000E761b85641F78C9D212A2eEaB","startBlock":13745359,"endBlock":13765069,"executed":true},"votes":[{"support":1,"voter":"0x110A924D724f4BfFC8B0ec7AE416565365e7aB34","numberOfVotes":0,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0xD70823761C043255f70a322388de2eD32F7f71e2","numberOfVotes":0,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x0D60943d3C4248D33ab1474DB126b9573D911D31","numberOfVotes":0,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x2EF24DDBb0551F71e270EBa4DA94fe72f98C178a","numberOfVotes":0,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x04Ba88309915D0210666790b9e9C9CB400235e3a","numberOfVotes":0,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x008c84421dA5527F462886cEc43D2717B686A7e4","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0xf504211d774c9B7d4c61959D6FE773D250A44DcF","numberOfVotes":2,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x6f9e3976fa3b5b22761fe5D635E1f0d9d9aeB85d","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x696ed7b26f4B019CEeC78DC8b9140ad64A6f354B","numberOfVotes":10,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0xAca3b4110403F3c4dacb35A7B3Aa0a84eFb6A3e9","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x01dB485f57Dc000E761b85641F78C9D212A2eEaB","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0xA387c87102fc0B51939d0CF9A86F7edd05291D5c","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x14dFDd3613054dDB14AF2Fa51c8a75E17dADe764","numberOfVotes":2,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x2573C60a6D127755aA2DC85e342F7da2378a0Cc5","numberOfVotes":12,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x91dCCAA260CC4616E1a6e6b693DB7207C5E42937","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""}]},{"prop":{"id":27,"description":"# Nouns Center by cdt.eth\n\nadapted from cdt.eth's post on discourse:  \n\n![n](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/nouns/original/1X/70ba17820156a1a258994d06263ec04c7de22a14.png)\n\n## Who is behind this proposal?\n\n**[cdt.eth ](https://twitter.com/cdt_eth) -** [Christian ](https://twitter.com/cdt_eth) is a software engineer who has worked on the [Nouns POAP](https://nounspoap.com/) team, created [ToadzToolz ](https://toadztoolz.com/) for Cryptoadz, and [SharkDAO’s ](https://sharkdao.community/) website as well as the forthcoming SharkDAO PFP project and a secret Nouns project with [12BNoun ](https://twitter.com/12bnoun). He’s also opened some PRs on https://nouns.wtf/ and has been an early-supporter of Nouns.\n\n## What is it?\n\n[Nouns Center ](https://twitter.com/NounsCenter) ([nouns.center ](https://nouns.center/)) will be a home for the Nouns community. The hope is to document all existing creators & projects, and help people discover the hundreds of new ones that will launch in the future. I did something similar with the Cryptoadz community by creating [ToadzToolz.com ](https://toadztoolz.com/toolz), but that was mainly to showcase projects. Whereas my vision for Nouns Center is to serve the community in 3 main ways.\n\n**1.

Until the forthcoming Design System is released, which can also live on this site. Imagine simply visiting [ `https://nouns.center/assets` ](https://nouns.center/assets) and finding everything you need to work and create with Nouns. Whether that be PNGs for artists or links to the folder on Github. The answers to all questions asked should be one link away.\n\n![i|450x372](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/nouns/original/1X/68dd2750be337c655a27f75d160b1ff6425f6c53.png)\n\nMy second pitch is to the Nounders to open their Discussions forum feature on [the monorepo ](https://github.com/nounsDAO/nouns-monorepo) to begin to capture all the answers they give to user questions every day. I added some example categories below to help visualize this. We could break up question types be category and begin to collect dozens of questions & answers in each section. The Nounders have spent a ton of time answering every question imaginable and very thoroughly, on a daily basis and I want to give them their time back. It will be some work up front to get the Discussions content up and running, but to have a technical content repository would be invaluable.\n\n![a](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/nouns/original/1X/f99536abdd4a03261d7e5a13aab4c52a0fbaad5f.png)\n\nGithub Discussions is free, comes with Search built-in, and the Nounders are Github-native. My plan is to fetch this data and bring it into the site. Imagine, if someone has a question they could simply visit [https://nouns.center/dev ](https://nouns.center/) to find all these answers, and I would fetch the data on this new site because artist and non-devs could benefit as well. Those who don’t have a Github account nor would ever go to the Developer channel on Discord could simply go to [https://nouns.center/artist ](https://nouns.center/) to find questions answered already about where to find assets, how to compose a Nouns, canvas dimensions etc.\n\nIt will snowball once the infrastructure is in place.\nQuestions will be asked once, and linked forever.\n\n# 2) Project Aggregator\n\nI’ve aggregated every piece of Nouns content (so far) that I could find in [this spreadsheet. ](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QlE93Uv4L3pTOPmrgLvr1NinPDB6atQ_ZbbU6vkHmXs/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nIt’s a lot. We’ve done a lot. I want to showcase all this effort.\n\n![r](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/nouns/original/1X/71224aa3e3eadc1c68f37dee22632c5707ab51bb.jpeg)\n\nImagine going to [ `https://nouns.center/projects` ](https://nouns.center/) and being able to see and access every single derivative, podcast episode, proposal project, YouTube video, and news story about Nouns. We should have a one-stop-shop for that as well. It should be compelling visually and truly highlight the power of CC0 and our community. We’ll highlight creators and link to their profiles as well. I’ll create a backlog submission system so we can capture user-submitted projects to streamline the process of getting added to the site. I did this with [https://toadztoolz.com/ideaz ](https://toadztoolz.com/ideaz).\n\nI want to inspire the next hundred projects to spawn out of Nouns,\nand we’ll be ready to give them the tools to do so.\n\n# 3) Onboarding Ramp\n\nLastly, I’d like to reduce as much friction as possible with people understanding the concepts & processes of NounsDAO. I’d like to find an artist to help with create some infographics about some key aspects of Nouns to help explain concepts like Proposals (How to Submit, Criteria, Timeline, and Payment), the Auction & Settlement process, buying a Noun = 1 vote in Dao, cloning & getting the Nouns webapp running locally for devs etc etc. There’s plenty of room to play with here, and yes, all these questions can be answered by a long paragraph of copy, but I loved what The Oracle did with the Proposal infographic.\n\n![h](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/nouns/original/1X/91dea0df191f4f42c0f030955f4ae66108b32e22.jpeg)\n\nand SharkDAO has an excellent one explaining its role within the NounsDAO. I believe these things work and they help solidify the concepts for folks. Plus it adds an air of Nouns both high-quality and creatively capable.\n\n![b](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/nouns/original/1X/53d2efcd3848707f471b3281f91f68d1d62c9a90.png)\n\nMake the unknowns, known.\nLet builders get back to building.\n\n## Where Does This Go?\n\nSome random thoughts where this could go in the future:\n\n* integrate Nouns official Design System?\n* sub-DAO onboarding?\n* Nouns Newsletter?\n* Verb Team [Nouns O’Clock integration](https://www.notion.so/Nouns-Automations-using-Integromat-Zapier-7f3af840dc1d4a04b1d728f978c785b0) to build something off auction endings?\n* Specific Nouns lore (integrate with [nouns.wtf](http://nouns.wtf/) sub-pages? show projects using a specific Noun in them?)\n* [Decentraland](https://decentraland.org/) meetups with [3D Nouns ](https://3dnouns.com/)?\n* _________________?\n\nRight now my plan is to establish this site as the central resource hub to serve the DAO and our community. Once the solid foundation is established the site can serve as a flywheel for creativity and projects to be housed and built on top of it.\n\n## Funds Requested\n\nThis proposal requests a total of 15 ETH from the DAO for design, development, planning, commissioning an artist, and maintenance for 6 months.\n\n\n\n","proposer":"0x3dbDF1a202d21aaC3309d91dAcFCEF84B8873f7a","startBlock":13762779,"endBlock":13782489,"executed":true},"votes":[{"support":1,"voter":"0xa555d1Ee16780B2d414eD97f4f169c0740099615","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x696ed7b26f4B019CEeC78DC8b9140ad64A6f354B","numberOfVotes":10,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0xAca3b4110403F3c4dacb35A7B3Aa0a84eFb6A3e9","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0xA387c87102fc0B51939d0CF9A86F7edd05291D5c","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x008c84421dA5527F462886cEc43D2717B686A7e4","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x6f9e3976fa3b5b22761fe5D635E1f0d9d9aeB85d","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x01dB485f57Dc000E761b85641F78C9D212A2eEaB","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x9Cb8C1463471eE4D8Dd6887035f4835a1745E92A","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x48e3E06520fF208746B8555076f7AF3E71Af1A4F","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x75Ee6eb3d8DAcf41eE2e5307090B197D3E1Cca6E","numberOfVotes":2,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x912A526852527dfB5D44c22a15B708AA493cDa6B","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x2573C60a6D127755aA2DC85e342F7da2378a0Cc5","numberOfVotes":13,"reason":""}]},{"prop":{"id":28,"description":"# Send a Noun to the International Space Station\n\nI’ve been speaking to a space company (name is confidential) that sends cargo up to the International Space Station (ISS) and assigns tasks (such as experiments) to astronauts on board.

This would be the first time a crypto or NFT character has ever traveled in space, and would generate a lot of publicity and forever be part of Nouns lore. The memes that can be generated from this event would be endless. With this project, Nouns DAO would be pushing the boundary of what crazy things can be achieved by DAOs.\n\nDANIT will design and 3D print the Noun to be delivered into space. She will send it to the company, where it will put the figurine through a variety of tests to make sure it is safe for entering space. \n\nNoun 22 will provide governance and an extra pair of eyes on all communications with the company to make sure everything is done above board. \n\nLaunch will occur sometime in H2 2022. The Noun will get sent up on a Space X (or similar) rocket to the ISS. Astronauts will take a picture of the Noun, with various backgrounds such as the inside of the space station and the window looking out on the Earth. These pictures would be sent to us and circulated in traditional and social media. We could choose to pay extra to deliver the Noun safely back to Earth, or pay less to dispose of it in however way NASA usually disposes of stuff. \n\nWe have the proposal from the company and if this is approved, I would personally enter into a contract with the company to begin this project, and use the ETH from the DAO to pay USD deposits on the work.

After the 10th page, NounsDAO made a coloring contest where everyone had the opportunity to paint and send multiple entries. The contest was a huge success and there were a lot of people who even recruited family members to join the party. \n\nIn the following link you can check the winners and finalists:\n\n[Nouns Coloring Book Contest Results](https://www.notion.so/noun22/Nouns-Coloring-Book-Contest-01857bc9cef14d4899f3fa99c45c13bc)\n\nAt last but not least, I have to thank Noun22 for all the amazing support, help and guidance on this since the beginning!

The donut is on top of Randy’s Donuts in Ingelwood, California.\n\n**Placement**: Fabricate & Place Nouns Glasses On Randy’s Donut\n\n**Renderings**:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/JUYEIIF.jpg)\n\n**Contributor Info**: My name is Josh and I own Plutus Media, a full service marketing agency based in NYC. In collaboration with a Los Angeles based business partner, WOW Media, I am proposing this unique outdoor placement for the Nouns! I am able to place media on Randy’s Donuts, a landmark donut shop in Inglewood, CA. Maybe you’ve seen it featured in Iron Man 2 when Tony Stark was eating a donut in the Iron Man suit on the donut.\n\n**Where**?: Randy’s Donuts- 805 W Manchester Blvd, Inglewood, CA 90301\n\n**When**?: Based on time to go live, the placement is available the entire month of March. So any week within March can be reserved.\n\nMy goal for this is to present the Nouns with a unique and viral outdoor advertising opportunity worthy of the DAO and Nouns brand. Something that everyone will talk about, share, and appreciate.\n\nThis outdoor placement is in true Nouns style, and not the typical Times Square NFT placement. The donut is also illuminated when the sun is down, so the donut will always be visible since Randy’s is open 24/7. The placement can be live for up to 3 weeks.\n\nThis Nouns glasses placement involves fabricating an over 30 foot pair of Nouns glasses and placing them directly in front of Randy’s Donut. Glasses will be fabricated using an aluminum frame with fabric, vinyl or mesh stretched over the frame to match artwork. Randy’s Donuts does not allow anything to puncture the donut statue, so the only option is having these glasses sit on a discreet frame.\n\n\n**Turnaround Time To Going Live (Post Payment & Receiving Creative)**: Up to 4 Weeks\n\n\n**Nouns Glasses Pricing Breakdown**:\nGlasses Fabrication + Install + Hardware= $35,000 (Additional Equipment Rental Fee Of $600/Week)\nDonut Rental Per Week= $27,000\n\n1 Week Live: $62,000 USD \n\n**Proposal Transactions**:\nTo account for price fluctuations of Ethereum, this proposal includes a transaction to send 30 ETH to the Nouns DAO Retroactive Funding and Small Grants Pool.  If the proposal passes, Small Grants will send the ETH equivalent $62,000 to Josh at Plutus Media.\n\nThis proposal also includes a 0.10 ETH gas reimbursement for submitting the on-chain proposal.\n\nThank you very much for taking the time to read this proposal, and I hope to work with the Nouns soon on this cool opportunity. \n\nA special thank you to Noun 22 for his guidance and support during this proposal process.","proposer":"0x75Ee6eb3d8DAcf41eE2e5307090B197D3E1Cca6E","startBlock":14082156,"endBlock":14101866,"executed":true},"votes":[{"support":1,"voter":"0x17cd072cBd45031EFc21Da538c783E0ed3b25DCc","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0xa555d1Ee16780B2d414eD97f4f169c0740099615","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":0,"voter":"0x5C503Df9051B1dbb941f3046cb293C97d7CEf4aD","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x696ed7b26f4B019CEeC78DC8b9140ad64A6f354B","numberOfVotes":14,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0xd3e2e76e4Ab0322614fe7aaA3be0B04beD83d0D0","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0xa4e232FcEedb3f43c8e707F8CF20B6BcF30f10E1","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x2573C60a6D127755aA2DC85e342F7da2378a0Cc5","numberOfVotes":18,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x75Ee6eb3d8DAcf41eE2e5307090B197D3E1Cca6E","numberOfVotes":2,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x83fCFe8Ba2FEce9578F0BbaFeD4Ebf5E915045B9","numberOfVotes":7,"reason":""}]},{"prop":{"id":37,"description":"# setProposalThresholdBPS(25)\n\nThis change would enable Noun owners or delegates to submit Nouns DAO proposals using a single vote until, and including, Noun 399.

TSP provides the resources, advocacy skills, grants and fellowship programs that guide skaters in creating their own community skateparks, from conception through construction. This is a collaborative process between skaters and city authorities to invest in capital improvements that will enrich a community for decades. The Skatepark Project’s grant programs have awarded over $10 million to help fund nearly 700 public skateparks in all 50 States, enjoyed by an estimated 6 million people annually.

We will be developing special filaments for the collection’s color palette. More on this in the next update!\n\n# New proposal for: milestone 3+4 - Patternmaking, Rendering & Modeling, as well as continued Print Testing\n\nI am working with 3 different experts for this part of the project:\n* **Patternmaking**: I have partnered with [Optitex](https://optitex.com/), a leading fashion design software company, who are working with me on patternmaking for the colleciton free of charge.\n* **Modeling**: I am working with a very talented modeler to turn my sketches and the patterns into 3D files that are printable. \n* **Rendering**: I am working with a brilliant 3D designer to create beautiful renderings of the collection, to be used in the Metaverse, or with potential 3D-printable NFTs, and generally to market the collection in the digital realm.\n\n**Here is an example of what a model looks like (these files will be used for 3D printing):**\n\n![Screen Shot 2022-02-20 at 13.15.30|284x500](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/nouns/optimized/1X/dd57ccf121bdaeee90207a93a4f56fe896cb8823_2_568x1000.jpeg)\n\n**Here is what Rendering looks like:**\n\n![Screen Shot 2022-02-20 at 13.15.30|284x500](https://media4.giphy.com/media/7zY33p99h4C2Cxph0a/giphy.gif?cid=790b761131099bc02407b61b96f8c44ed8440e634d29dc89&rid=giphy.gif&ct=g)\n\n\nHere's the budget for these milestones: \n\n* **Modeling 7 outfits (15 items):** 7 ETH\n* **Rendering 7 outfits (15 items)**: 2.3 ETH\n* **Prints tests**: 1 ETH\n* **My work (around 3 months)** 7.6 ETH\n* **Total** = 17.9 ETH\n\nThis would bring the project up to now to a total spend of 21.05 ETH (3.15 + 17.9), which is approx $63K in USD value. I now expect the total cost of the project to be around $100-150K, depending on printing costs and marketing costs (mainly photoshoot/runway).\n\nThank you all for the support.

Update the UX of the auction page and integrate it with the Noun profile pages\n2. Update the UX of the governance page\n3. Update the UX of the proposal page\n\nI achieved all of these goals during Prop 17. In addition, I also took it upon myself to do the following:\n\n1. Created the (recently revamped) nounsstats.wtf page which provides insight into Noun rarity and Noun Governance participation\n2. Created (pro bono) a bot to automatically create snapshot votes for Shark DAO based on the creation of new on-chain Nouns DAO proposals\n3. Helped automate parts of Bidder POAP\n4. Review PRs for nouns.wtf\n\n### What I will do during my next residency\n\nI have two main goals for my next residency:\n\n#### Continue to maintain nouns.wtf\n\nI will be taking on more of an ownership role of nouns.wtf going forward. This means that in addition to reviewing inbound PRs, I will be responsible for ongoing bug fixes and improvements. \n\nOne particular task to call out as part of improvements is getting to a few UI details that we didn't have time for during Prop 17 (ex: bid history modal).\n\n#### Make nouns.wtf more robust, extensible, and contributor friendly\n\n1. Revamp CI / CD pipeline to allow easy deploy to prod (process right now is very manual)\n2. Add real time error monitoring so we can rollback bad changes quickly with minimal negative user impact\n3. Generally improve code quality and documentation of the codebase to make it more contributor friendly (in particular, documentation around our Github processes to make it easier for new contributors to onboard)\n4. Refactor nouns.wtf to use a nouns component library to allow people to easily build on our “look and feel”\n5. Localize nouns.wtf to increase the reach of our brand to non-english audiences \n6. Security audit to assess risk and patch any potential exploits should they exist\n\n### Proposed workflow\n\nI propose the following framework for tracking my progress and giving the DAO visibility into my work. \n\n#### Monthly updates\n\nI will give monthly written updates to the DAO. These will be akin to investor update emails.\nThey will include:\n1. What did I say I was going to get done last month\n2. What of that did I actually get done\n3. What am I committing to getting done in the coming month\n\n#### Project scoping docs\n\nFor every distinct project I take on, I will write a short scoping doc (1-2 pages) which I will share with the community for visibility (either on Discord or Github). In this context one project roughly equals one bullet point in the section of my goals (ex: localize nouns.wtf would be one project).\n\nThese scoping docs will include the following information:\n1. Project goals (project must do x, should do y)\n2. Project non-goals (what, if anything, is explicitly out of scope)\n3. High level description of technical aspects of proposed change\n4. Project milestones with ETAs\n\n#### Github projects + Discord\nIn addition to tracking progress at the project level, I will continue to use Github issues, Github projects, and frequent updates to the Nounders (in a private project Discord channel) to promote accountability and give the DAO visibility into my daily work. \n\n\n### Proposed compensation\n\nI propose that I am compensated 62.52414 ETH over 6 months (10.42069 ETH per month distributed via a Sablier stream).\n\nI think this is a fair rate for 2 reasons:\n1. 22's recent proposal passed at this rate. We were both previously funded by Prop 17\n2. This rate is fairly in line (in fact a bit lower) on an annualized + USD converted basis with what I was making in my previous normie tech job / what I was offered by normie tech companies when I recently interviewed (~4 months ago)\n\n\n\n### Closing thoughts\n\nI believe that over the last 3 months, I've show that I can execute with little oversight and generate value for the DAO (in excess of original project scope). I have greatly enjoyed building with all of you over the last 3 months and hope you will give me the opportunity to continue with you on this great journey.","proposer":"0x75Ee6eb3d8DAcf41eE2e5307090B197D3E1Cca6E","startBlock":14452235,"endBlock":14471945,"executed":true},"votes":[{"support":1,"voter":"0x4754b7e3DEde42D71d6c92978f25F306176EC7e9","numberOfVotes":7,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0xf8A065F287d91d77cD626AF38ffA220D9B552A2b","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x696ed7b26f4B019CEeC78DC8b9140ad64A6f354B","numberOfVotes":12,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x33DaF8e90Cd1f214CC25A1865649e847254F2ece","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0xaf05abCfe204F9C2e5e5cdF83e485F7F72EB0e9f","numberOfVotes":2,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x32d1A53f6709a03f4b6cf4cb0501204ba188d4f5","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0xf86A6FA100f50e9E715b57D176214c93e6d6bCEa","numberOfVotes":0,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0xcC2688350d29623E2A0844Cc8885F9050F0f6Ed5","numberOfVotes":5,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x6f9e3976fa3b5b22761fe5D635E1f0d9d9aeB85d","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x83fCFe8Ba2FEce9578F0BbaFeD4Ebf5E915045B9","numberOfVotes":7,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x2573C60a6D127755aA2DC85e342F7da2378a0Cc5","numberOfVotes":23,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x91dCCAA260CC4616E1a6e6b693DB7207C5E42937","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""}]},{"prop":{"id":46,"description":"# Marketplace Pod Proposal\n\n## Goal\n\nCreate a Nouns marketplace for originals and extension projects.\n\n## Why?\n\n* Create a free marketplace for secondary sales of Nouns.\n* Facilitate the exentions ecosystem: make it easier to search and discover the Nouns ecosystem.\n\nBuild distribution for the NounsDAO: build community and liquidity that NounsDAO can use to potentially curate in the future.\n\n## Considerations\n\n* 0% fees\n* No official endorsement of derivatives\n* Linked to from nouns.wtf header\n* Feels nounish in branding and aesthetic\n* Entirely open source\n* Low barrier to entry for derivatives to be added to the marketplace\n* This will be manually operated to start and managed by the marketplace pod.\n* We can work on an automated and more trustless way to recognize derivatives and get closer to permissionless listings.\n\n## Budget\n\n50 ETH for 6 months of marketplace pod operations\n\n## Milestones\n\n* Design sign off from community\n* 2-4 weeks initial development time\n* Deployed at nouns.town domain (need to confirm)\n* Marketplace launch with initial batch of derivatives\n* Offchain orders\n* Add in Daily Nouns Auction experience\n* Automated derivative addition\n* [Stretch]: Aggregate other marketplaces\n* [Stretch]: Enable swaps\n\n## Team\nNoun 174 ([Jacob](https://twitter.com/js_horne))\nNoun 178 ([Blequity](https://twitter.com/BlequityDAO))\n\n## Disclosure:\nWe are the co-creators of Zora, the NFT marketplace protocol.

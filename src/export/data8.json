[{"prop":{"id":350,"description":"# Pay Dustin Yellin 50 eth to complete purchase of PERSON, PLACE, or THING\n\nThis proposal is a continuation of proposals 327 and 328.  328 was not properly executed and all of the NAC eth was transferred back to the nouns treasury.  As such, i am proposing that we approve a final 50 eth payment to complete the purchase of this sculpture.  As detailed below, we will then submit a new proposal for the first placement of the sculpture at Zero Bond in New York City.\n\nPrevious proposal text:\n\nIn April 2022 the Nouns DAO voted on and executed Proposal 48 - Nouns Psychogeography Sculpture with Dustin Yellin, wherein the Brooklyn-based artist was commissioned to update the Leviathan image by creating PERSON, PLACE, or THING, a new sculptural portrait layering each Nouns avatar into one fantastic body. For the commission, Yellin hand painted the 402 Nouns minted in Year One, integrating them into a unique glass artwork to forge a record of the history of the Nouns DAO, while branding its newest emblem.\n\nMuch like a yearbook, a ship’s manifest, or the signatures under a document, this snapshot provides a freeze frame of the DAO’s founders and builders. This in-all-is-one super-avatar represents the shared vision and trust between all stakeholders, while providing a rallying banner - an art object - that crystalizes how individuals are more powerful when they come together, and how a community can achieve the seemingly impossible by focusing its collective resources and talents around a common task.\n\nUpon acceptance of Proposal 48, the Nouns DAO compensated the artist with an initial deposit of 50ETH and made a donation of 100,000 USDC to the non-profit cultural center, Pioneer Works.\n\nA second payment of 50ETH and 1 Noun NFT (Noun 252 from the Nouns treasury) was agreed to be paid upon completion of the PERSON, PLACE, or THING sculpture and its accompanying NFT.\n\nLink to images of the finished sculpture: https://www.dustinyellin.com/d/6afb72\nLink to the NFT: Psychoprogeny - https://opensea.io/assets/ethereum/0x3dde7d56735d5ab659544070679e9350d23d5b0b/2\n\nUpon acceptance of this proposal, the NFT for PERSON, PLACE, or THING will be transferred from DustinYellinDeployer to a Nouns DAO wallet.\n\nDustin Yellin Studio will then submit a new proposal to Nouns DAO requesting 12ETH to cover the expense of crating, transporting, and installing the 3,000 lb sculpture in the foyer of the main dining room of the Manhattan social club, Zero Bond, and back to the artist's studio at the conclusion of the loan period. The expected loan period will be 1-3 years, during which time Dustin Yellin Studio will work on additional loan placements for the work at museums and relevant cultural institutions worldwide.\n\nThe artist will provide an informative label to accompany the sculpture at Zero Bond, including details about the work and its ownership by Nouns DAO.\n\n50 ETH Deposit and transfer of Noun 252 to Dustin Yellin Studio:\n0x0B789Ef2A2cda2fb5B5c7cdB278C2Cb8BdC96e4C","proposer":"0xd3e2e76e4Ab0322614fe7aaA3be0B04beD83d0D0","startBlock":17841969,"endBlock":17877969,"executed":true},"votes":[{"support":1,"voter":"0x008c84421dA5527F462886cEc43D2717B686A7e4","numberOfVotes":17,"reason":""},{"support":0,"voter":"0xf6B6F07862A02C85628B3A9688beae07fEA9C863","numberOfVotes":46,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x7f64C6e6908DE72221A06A06b4a02A6546a4d6d2","numberOfVotes":2,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x86030dbbCe1c771Ff6622C20455cd3619aa93c05","numberOfVotes":55,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x89f42ccb1B90103A4b886Cc8ee01979492808079","numberOfVotes":0,"reason":"When I read the title of this prop, I said to myself \"wtf, why are we sending this dude 50 ETH?\"\n\nThankfully, I came to my senses once I saw the physical sculpture (the NFT is cool too, but that won't bring any new eyes to NounsDAO (imo.))\n\nMy only gripe with this proposal is paying another 12 ETH to Dustin to install this in a place that I've never even heard of.

But because NAC is just a delegated multisig, none of the above could be executed onchain by the proposal and amounted to a glorified request. \n\nI have often argued that we should not vote YES for proposals that do not do something tangible onchain, and this is a perfect example as to why— after 327 passed, NAC sent Dustin the Noun he was owed, but then returned all remaining ETH to the treasury. Probably they didn’t feel that using the ETH they were given to purchase Nouns for builders to instead pay a builder outright was within their mandate. Whatever the reason, we now needed prop 350 to get the job done. \n\nHopefully we can learn from this cautionary tale about governance theatre so we don’t waste people’s time with repeat proposals in future and lose the confidence of collaborators by leaving them in limbo. \n\n/onchain rant \n\nThank you to Max Power and Dustin Yellin for your patience throughout. \n\n\n*sent from voter.wtf*"},{"support":1,"voter":"0x114AE4bc8E76742bdBA44063af2f7046BcbD8cFb","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":"Send this artist his well earned eth and noun as per the previously passed original prop!

We’re listing those here explicitly for the sake of max transparency. There were other issues we did not fix because we disagreed with the auditors’ analysis, and those are not listed here.\n\n\n\n* [Setting a new fork escrow contract might lead to lost tokens](https://github.com/nounsDAO/nouns-monorepo/issues/765)\n* [Proposals can move from Expired state back to Queued when timelock’s Grace Period changes](https://github.com/nounsDAO/nouns-monorepo/issues/764)\n\n\n## Changes in detail\n\n\n### Proposal editing\n\nProposals get voter feedback almost entirely only once they are onchain. At the same time, proposers are reluctant to cancel and resubmit their proposals for multiple reasons, e.g. prefering to avoid restarting the proposal lifecycle and thus delay funding.\n\nThere have been cases where proposers made promises offchain, e.g. to return part of the funds, but that is not captured onchain, and not visible to the entire voter base.\n\nThis feature introduces a new state into the proposal lifecycle:\n\n```\nUpdatable (new) → Pending → Active …\n```\n\nDuring the Updatable state, a proposer can update their proposal’s description and/or transactions. Following the Updatable state, there’s a Pending state during which updates are no longer available before voting starts during the Active state.\n\nThe length of the Updatable state is configurable by the DAO, and starts at zero. This effectively keeps the feature disabled. A separate proposal will follow with proposed periods for the state, for example: Updatable: 5 days, Pending: 1 day\n\nThere’s also an onchain method of providing feedback to proposals while they are in the Updatable state.\n\n\n### Propose by signatures\n\n_Proposal threshold_ is the number of votes an account must control in order to submit a proposal. As of this writing an account must have at least 2 votes to pass the threshold.\n\nCurrent methods of sponsoring a proposal and their problems:\n\nNouners today either delegate their Nouns to proposers or submit the proposal on their behalf.\nDelegating is limited to Nouners, since delegates can re-delegate their vote to another account.\nWhen a Nouner delegates, they can’t use their voting power for the length of the proposal lifecycle which is very inconvenient.\n\nIf a Nouner/delegate chooses to submit a proposal on behalf of the proposer, we lose the meaning of who is the actual proposer and also the process itself can be cumbersome where the delegate needs to make sure the proposal looks good and pay gas for it.\n\nThis upgrade introduces a new function to the DAO contract: `proposeBySigs`.\nThis allows anyone to submit a proposal and a set of signatures. The signatures are provided by voters and need to match the proposal content. If the sum of votes from all the signers surpasses proposal threshold, the proposal can be submitted.\n\nThe goal is to open another channel through which proposers can submit proposals, without necessarily finding a sponsor through private channels.\n\nVoters can only be signers if they don’t currently have an active proposal, either as a proposer or signer. Signers of a proposal can cancel it at any time, and the same is true for proposers; proposers should choose their signers carefully.\n\nThis allows both Nouners and delegates to “sign-off” on a proposal, while the proposer address remains the actual proposer and without the need to change delegations.\nIt also allows pooling voting power, e.g. two delegates with 1 vote each can sign a proposal in order for it to pass the proposal threshold, currently at 2 votes.\nIt also opens the door to raising the proposal threshold since it’s easier to collect voting power.\n\nAs part of this update we are adding support for “proposal candidates” to nouns.wtf, where proposers can submit their proposals and request signatures. In order to prevent spam, creating a candidate proposal requires either holding 1 vote or sending 0.1 ETH (the ETH recipient and the amount are configurable by the DAO).\nThe candidate proposals data are submitted to a side contract to make this data publicly available for any frontend to interact with.\n\n\n### Objection-only period\n\nThe goal is to protect the DAO from executing proposals that the majority would not want to execute. The threat is one where a minority trying to pass a proposal can let the proposal look like it's failing, to cultivate voter apathy, then cast many of their For votes just before voting ends, swinging the proposal from defeated to successful, leaving the majority wishing they were more vigilant.\n\nThis upgrade introduces a new state in the proposal lifecycle: `ObjectionPeriod`.\n\n``` \\\n… Active (regular voting period) → ObjectionPeriod (conditional) → Succeeded / Defeated \\\n```\n\nObjectionPeriod gets turned on only if a proposal turns from not passing to passing close enough to the end of the voting period.\n\nDuring the `ObjectionPeriod` state, only voters who haven’t voted yet are allowed to vote, but only _against_ the proposal.\n\nQ: Why not allow voting For a proposal during this extra voting period?\nA: Similar to the attack scenario described above, it would still allow voters to keep their votes to themselves and vote only at the last minute. In this case it would be right before the ObjectionPeriod ends.\n\nMore broadly speaking, the risk that a proposal passes when it shouldn’t, is much higher than the risk of a proposal not passing when it should.\nA proposal can be re-proposed, but a proposal that passes can’t be reversed.\n\nDAO configurable parameters:\n1. `objectionPeriodDurationInBlocks`: how long the objection period lasts, e.g. 2 days\n2. `lastMinuteWindowInBlocks`: what is considered “last minute”? e.g. 2 hours\n\nBoth parameters start with values of zero, effectively making this feature disabled. A separate proposal will follow turning on this feature with suggested parameters.\n\n\n### Votes Snapshot After Voting Delay\n\nThe current DAO implementation takes a snapshot of votes & delegation at the block a proposal is created, meaning Nouners have no lead time to put their votes in order, e.g. moving their delegations back to themselves to vote on something they really care about.\n\nThis upgrade changes the snapshot to be after the voting delay, i.e. once voting starts. Nouners will now have the duration of voting delay to transfer, buy, sell, delegate and undelegate their votes.\n\nBecause the nouns supply grows during the voting delay, nouns that are minted during the voting delay also participate in voting. Originally the snapshot was taken during proposal creation in order to align the total supply and the quorum and proposal calculations, which are performed at proposal creation time. Now that the supply has grown, this inconsistency is insignificant.\n\n\n### Nouns Fork\n\nFurther details can be found here in [the tech spec](https://github.com/verbsteam/nouns-fork-spec/blob/main/spec.md) and [this post](https://mirror.xyz/0x10072dfc23771101dC042fD0014f263316a6E400/iN0FKOn_oYVBzlJkwPwK2mhzaeL8K2-W80u82F7fHj8).\n\n\n### New treasury\n\nThe DAO fork feature requires switching to a new treasury contract which allows the DAO to transfer ETH and ERC20 tokens when a fork executes. The current treasury (treasury v1) contract is not upgradable, so it requires a migration to a new one. The new treasury (treasury v2), deployed at [0xb1a32FC9F9D8b2cf86C068Cae13108809547ef71](https://etherscan.io/address/0xb1a32FC9F9D8b2cf86C068Cae13108809547ef71), adds the new functions to the existing contract, and is upgradable to avoid the need for migrations in the future.\n\nThe migration includes:\n\n1. Transferring ETH, stETH, wstETH, rETH & USDC\n2. Changing ownership of the auction house, auction house proxy admin, nouns token & nouns descriptor contracts\n3. Change ownership of TokenBuyer and Payer to allow treasury v2 to perform ETH/USDC swaps\n4. Approve the treasury v2 to transfer lil nouns from treasury v1\n\nOther assets in treasury v1 can be moved or approved to be moved in follow up proposals. Only assets in treasury v2 are included in the treasury forking in case of a fork.\n\nDAO proposals are limited to 10 transactions, therefore we are doing the migration in two steps. There will be a follow up proposal with the second part of the migration. The follow up proposal will go onchain once this one executes.\n\nThe DAO will still have access to the original treasury (treasury v1), by proposing proposals via the `proposeOnTimelockV1` function.\n\nExisting streams created by the DAO will remain controlled by treasury v1. If the DAO chooses to cancel them, the `proposeOnTimelockV1` function will need to be used.\n\n\n## Important heads up\n\n**Proposals that are queued but not yet executed before this proposal executes will need to be executed using the `executeOnTimelockV1` function. The regular `execute` function will attempt to execute via treasury v2 and will fail.**\n\n\n## Proposal #1 Transactions (this proposal):\n1. Send 2,500 ETH to new treasury contract \\\nThe rest of the ETH will be transferred in a followup proposal. We can’t tell in advance how much ETH the treasury will have at the moment this proposal executes so we are sending a first chunk now.\n2. Upgrade the DAO contract logic to V3\n3. Set the fork params:\n    a. forkEscrow: the escrow contract\n    b. forkDeployer: the contract which deploys new forked DAOs\n    c. erc20TokensToIncludeInFork: addresses of erc20 tokens which will be included in the treasury fork, specifically: stETH, wstETH, rETH and USDC\n    d. forkPeriod: the period during which token holders can join a fork after it has been executed, 7 days\n    e. forkThresholdBPS: the % of nouns required to surpass in order to activate a fork, 2,000 bps = 20%\n4. Set the proposal id at which the vote snapshot will be changed to be after voting delay\n    a. Sets it to the next proposal after the current one\n5. Transfer ownership of the auction house proxy contract\n6. Send stETH to the new treasury, leaving 1,000 stETH for proposals that may be queued\n7. Change ownership of the Nouns token contract\n8. Change ownership of the Nouns descriptor contract\n9. Transfer ownership of the auction house proxy admin\n10. Set treasury V2 as the new treasury of the DAO contract, and set treasury v1 to be available to reference for `proposeOnTimelockV1`\n\n\n## Proposal #2 Transactions:\n\n**This proposal will be submitted only after the first one executes, since only then we will know the final amount of ETH in treasury V1 to transfer as part of this proposal.**\n\n1. Move leftover ETH from treasury v1 to treasury v2\n2. Approve treasury v2 to transfer lil nouns from treasury v1\n3. Transfer ownership of TokenBuyer to treasury v2\n4. Transfer ownership of Payer to treasury v2\n5. Approve unlimited stETH to be transferred by the ERC20Transferer contract\n6. Invoke ERC20Transferer to send remaining stETH to the new treasury\n7. Transfer all wstETH to treasury v2\n8. Transfer all rETH to treasury v2\n9. Transfer all USDC to treasury v2\n\nCan be viewed in more detail [here](https://github.com/nounsDAO/nouns-monorepo/blob/9cbc7dde418d5ba7a1b50d0b0348dd14b6191404/packages/nouns-contracts/script/ProposeTimelockMigrationCleanupMainnet.s.sol).\n\n\n## Proposal #3 Transactions:\n\n1. Set ENS reverse lookup on treasury V2 to resolve to nouns.eth\n\n\n## Proposal execution notes\n\n* Proposals #1 and #2 will be executed on treasury v1, while proposal #3 is executed on treasury v2.\n* Prior to executing proposal #3, the accounts that control nouns.eth will set nouns.eth to point to treasury v2.\n","proposer":"0x05A286e5165D72823A749B00b009a2aF0dc36Ff7","startBlock":17862241,"endBlock":17898241,"executed":false},"votes":[]},{"prop":{"id":354,"description":"# Nouns DAO V3 upgrade, including Nouns Fork (edit)\n\n\nEdit: changing stETH transfer (tx #6) to a lower amount in case proposal 352 passes\n\n## Summary\n\nThis proposal upgrades the Nouns DAO logic contract to V3.

Change ownership of TokenBuyer and Payer to allow treasury v2 to perform ETH/USDC swaps\n4. Approve the treasury v2 to transfer lil nouns from treasury v1\n\nOther assets in treasury v1 can be moved or approved to be moved in follow up proposals. Only assets in treasury v2 are included in the treasury forking in case of a fork.\n\nDAO proposals are limited to 10 transactions, therefore we are doing the migration in two steps. There will be a follow up proposal with the second part of the migration. The follow up proposal will go onchain once this one executes.\n\nThe DAO will still have access to the original treasury (treasury v1), by proposing proposals via the `proposeOnTimelockV1` function.\n\nExisting streams created by the DAO will remain controlled by treasury v1. If the DAO chooses to cancel them, the `proposeOnTimelockV1` function will need to be used.\n\n\n## Important heads up\n\n**Proposals that are queued but not yet executed before this proposal executes will need to be executed using the `executeOnTimelockV1` function. The regular `execute` function will attempt to execute via treasury v2 and will fail.**\n\n\n## Proposal #1 Transactions (this proposal):\n1. Send 2,500 ETH to new treasury contract \\\nThe rest of the ETH will be transferred in a followup proposal. We can’t tell in advance how much ETH the treasury will have at the moment this proposal executes so we are sending a first chunk now.\n2. Upgrade the DAO contract logic to V3\n3. Set the fork params:\n    a. forkEscrow: the escrow contract\n    b. forkDeployer: the contract which deploys new forked DAOs\n    c. erc20TokensToIncludeInFork: addresses of erc20 tokens which will be included in the treasury fork, specifically: stETH, wstETH, rETH and USDC\n    d. forkPeriod: the period during which token holders can join a fork after it has been executed, 7 days\n    e. forkThresholdBPS: the % of nouns required to surpass in order to activate a fork, 2,000 bps = 20%\n4. Set the proposal id at which the vote snapshot will be changed to be after voting delay\n    a. Sets it to the next proposal after the current one\n5. Transfer ownership of the auction house proxy contract\n6. Send stETH to the new treasury, leaving 5,000 stETH for proposals that may be queued\n7. Change ownership of the Nouns token contract\n8. Change ownership of the Nouns descriptor contract\n9. Transfer ownership of the auction house proxy admin\n10. Set treasury V2 as the new treasury of the DAO contract, and set treasury v1 to be available to reference for `proposeOnTimelockV1`\n\n\n## Proposal #2 Transactions:\n\n**This proposal will be submitted only after the first one executes, since only then we will know the final amount of ETH in treasury V1 to transfer as part of this proposal.**\n\n1. Move leftover ETH from treasury v1 to treasury v2\n2. Approve treasury v2 to transfer lil nouns from treasury v1\n3. Transfer ownership of TokenBuyer to treasury v2\n4. Transfer ownership of Payer to treasury v2\n5. Approve unlimited stETH to be transferred by the ERC20Transferer contract\n6. Invoke ERC20Transferer to send remaining stETH to the new treasury\n7. Transfer all wstETH to treasury v2\n8. Transfer all rETH to treasury v2\n9. Transfer all USDC to treasury v2\n\nCan be viewed in more detail [here](https://github.com/nounsDAO/nouns-monorepo/blob/9cbc7dde418d5ba7a1b50d0b0348dd14b6191404/packages/nouns-contracts/script/ProposeTimelockMigrationCleanupMainnet.s.sol).\n\n\n## Proposal #3 Transactions:\n\n1.

I've always viewed nouns as a public art & public software movement. I feared as governance started to tip over that ppl viewed nouns as such a public goods movement might just have to fold and give up if the majority starts ruling tyrannically with a different agenda. we could all attempt to sell our nouns in the secondary of course and try to regroup but who would buy hundreds of nouns at once? especially a version of nouns nfts that's experiencing mass exodus. at this time period (early this year) tensions were at their highest imo. the two sides of nouns would keep seeing shadows at every corner and assumed only the worst intentions of each other. \n\nwhat ultimately gave me peace is the fork mechanism. once we landed on this direction and the verbs team started implementation I was able to put away my existential fears and start engaging within governance with a more cooperative mindset again. it fundamentally put both sides, the soon to be voting majority (finance) and the voting minority (culture), on an equal playing field. I'm not saying that the fork mechanism will necessarily cause a fork. my hope and expectation is that the fork mechanism's existence will allow for more good faith cooperation b/c both sides can gain from the other. the finance side can consent to spending more knowing that if it gets out of hand they can fork and leave with their share of the treasury. the culture side can get over the feeling of being ruled over and get back to enjoying and building culture in good faith knowing that they too could exit and continue with their share of the (smaller) treasury if things get really bad.\n\nwhat I'm ultimately saying here is that *I* would benefit from the fork mechanism. not only just some opportunistic arbitrageur or some theoretical potential minority of the future but me here and now. this is why I'm voting FOR this proposal. \n\nlastly, just to address the view that adding this fork mechanism would lead to endless arbitrage attempts. it might sound obvious but it's worth pointing out that the arb only exists when a positive gap between book value and auction price exists. unless you think auction price is going to be down only (which I fundamentally don't believe since there will be a price level where ppl buy nouns for the \"art\" the same way ppl buy crypto punks) then spending alone will gradually close the gap. just a steady auction price and a steady spending rate will inevitably result in the arb opportunity going away. of course that doesn't mean it's gone forever. whenever we experience a really elevated auction price that later then crashes we can end up in this place again. but that's more like every 4 years (rough crypto cycle) rather than constantly as many fear. yes there might be a quick \"exit\" (not really a fork) right after this mechanism is implemented. but the fear of profiteers shouldn't stop us from fundamentally improving our governance. we should take the step forward. I'm excited for season 3.

Retroactively supporting 4 workshops with the National Volunteer and Philantrophy Centre of Singapore and providing a Nounish presence at the Ethereum Singapore conference - 15,000 USDC**\n\nThe [National Volunteer and Philantrophy Centre](https://cityofgood.sg/) work with 2,000 charities and non-profits in Singapore and have come on board as a partner for the hackathon. 4 workshops have been run together with them engaging 40 non-profits as we educate them on Web3. The workshops were:\n1. Crash course on Web3 for non-profit organisations\n2. Using Web3 for NPOs - when, where, how?\n3. Hands-on workshop - setting up an ENS, demo on QF with clrfund\n4. Road to Ethereum SG: Defining Challenge Statements\n\nThe final workshop led to challenge statements being generated for Ethereum Singapore. Furthermore, this process will be thoroughly documented and disseminated as an **open-source playbook**, serving as a public good empowering other communities globally where they are able to freely utilize the hackathon format as a guide.\n\nAt Ethereum Singapore, we are breaking from the norm of using booths to showcase Nouns. Instead, the **entire venue** will be transformed into an **immersive playground for Nouns**, allowing event guests to fully engage with the world of Nouns throughout their visit. This fresh approach offers abundant photo opportunities and generates brand awareness as well as online attention as guests share their experiences on social media. We will feature Nouns as much as possible during the event including speaking and physical activations.\n\nWhat to expect:\n- 3D Nouns models all around the venue (ref. [Nouns fair](https://twitter.com/avee_eth/status/1683361931678064643?s=20))\n- Hackathon format released as a **open-source playbook**\n- Nouns discussion panel \n- Nouns logo (Noggle) placement on ETH Singapore Website\n- ETH Singapore social media recognition pre/post event\n- ETH Singapore post-event video produced by Angelhack\n- Event Staff/Volunteers wearing Noggle\n- Event ticket allocation\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SywCIVHsn.png)\n*3D Nouns all around the venue*\n\n**2. Hackathon Bounty - 5,000 USDC**\n- This bounty will be added to the hackathon prize pool for incentivizing more proliferation and public goods building. Bounty format will be similar to what was used by Nouns at previous EthGlobal hackathons.\n\n**3. Purchase of wearable Noggle - 1,600 USDC (including shipping & tax)**\n\nTo be worn by staff/volunteer/guest:\n- Classic (plastic) Noggles: 5 boxes of 10pcs/box at USD250/box\n- Lo-fi Paper Noggle (qty: 1000pcs): (Allocation from Prop #334)\n\n**4. Nounish activation - 6,000 USDC (including logistics)**\n  \nTo boost engagement and knowledge retention, we'll gamify the swag distribution process with a Nouns Questionnaire. Participants & Hackers will be challenged to find answers via NounsDAO webpage or socials. This interactive game aims to leave a impression and help participants remember what they learned about Nouns while winning themselves some Nounish swag. Proliferating with a purpose. Additionally, it helps drive traffic towards Nouns, increasing its prominence.\n\nA Mega Gachapon Machine (Nounified) will serve as the activation point.\nIt serves multiple purpose:\n\n- Brand awareness – Earning Nounish swag; Noggel everywhere. \n- Learning –  Questionnair game that foster curiously towards Nouns. Team will also be answering questions about all things Nounish.\n\nBreakdown for this section:\n- **Nouns X ETH Singapore Tshirt (Qty: 350)**: $4,200\n- **Nouns enamel pins (Qty: 150)**: $525\n- **Stickers (Qty: 1000)**: $200\n- **Mega Gachapon Machine Rental (Qty: 2 days)**: $425\n- **Logistics**: $650\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rk9_JEBsh.png)\n\n**5. Run with Nouns Running Club**\n\nThe [Nouns Running Club](https://twitter.com/nounsrc) supports this proposal as it fosters a positive sum game by encouraging collaboration and growth. We are thrilled to share that the club has already initiated the planning of an official run alongside Ethereum Singapore. With the successful passing of this proposition, we believe that it will make a substantial contribution to the widespread adoption & visibility to Nouns Running Club powered by Nouns.  \n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/Sy79V8Rqh.png)\n\n# **Total = 27,600 USDC** to be sent to [ethereumsingapore.eth](https://etherscan.io/address/ethereumsingapore.eth)\n\n# **Motivation for Nouns to be at Ethereum Singapore**\n## 1. In true Nounish spirit, it is focused on public goods & non-profits\nThe spirit of bringing Web3 to enable real impact **deeply resonates with Nouns ethos**, where the very first proposal ever passed on NounsDAO was to [\"Donate 5 ETH each to 6 charities\"](https://nouns.wtf/vote/1) and also produced [public good structure like prop house to empower builders](https://nouns.center/funding). \n\nSimilarly at Ethereum Singapore we shared the same vision featuring a hackathon for good where the challenge statements will be [collaboratively developed](https://twitter.com/ethereum_sg/status/1676447827353018369?s=20) with local *charities and non-profit organizations* that have an interest in web3 technologies. Our collaborating partner [National Volunteer and Philantrophy Centre](https://cityofgood.sg/) which stewards the vision of making Singapore a City of Good will be working with thousands of local charities and non-profits engaging up to **50+ organisations at the leadership level** to educate them about blockchain technology bringing Web3 to them.   \n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HJ7euU2c2.png)\n\n## 2. Southeast Asia presence + Devcon2024 will be in this region!\nThe team also aims to leverage this opportunity to effectively introduce Nouns to the local communities with the assistance of [@nounsinsg](https://twitter.com/nounsinsg), fostering greater awareness and comprehension of Nouns while leaving a memorable impact on Singapore, the blockchain hub of Southeast Asia.\nLooking ahead, all eyes will be on Southeast Asia as [Devcon is set to come the region](https://twitter.com/EFDevcon/status/1630543172974657538?cxt=HHwWhIC-gY-Y7aAtAAAA). Ethereum Singapore has [committed to dedicate its excess funds](https://mirror.xyz/ethereumsingapore.eth/MyMITRe0nHv1iqjx3jNxZtaq4M5d37wstODRkUCw-9k) to support local developers, events, education initiatves, and meaningful public goods for the region and hopes to set a new cultural norm for Ethereum events.\n\n## 3. A Nounish gathering point for our community\nEthereum Singapore is [held during F1 week](https://www.panewslab.com/zh_hk/token2049sideevents/index.html) which numerous events such as Token2049, Filecoin Summit, Froyoverse, NFT Asia, Milken Institute Asia Summit, and many more are held. Amidst the hectic non-stop event schedule, Nouns holders can feel at home at Ethereum Singapore with like-minded friends and our adopted web3 family members. The wider public interested in web3 can also learn about what we're all about and perhaps their first web3 interaction would be with a Nounish artifact!\n\n# **Executing Personnel:**\n[QZ:](https://twitter.com/not_qz) Main organiser and [meetup lead](https://www.meetup.com/ethereum-singapore/) for Ethereum Singapore.

This prop is a statement of resilience, a pledge that will not be broken or **canceled**.\n\nFinalized with meticulous care between January and February, V3's design stands unchanged. The community, blindsided by the spontaneous cancellation despite comprehensive legal opinions and exhaustive audits, remains united and vigilant. Claims of a \"crypto-economic issue\" find no echo among the community, auditors, Cayman Foundation's law firm, or the CT community at large. Yet, we should all stand ready for open discourse within the five days before this prop goes live. **This prop will not be canceled.** The community alone will decide, again.\n\nThis proposal symbolizes something profound. It is the very test of whether Nouns is controlled by the collective strength and wisdom of the community/token holders or controlled by a select few known as the Nounders/multisig holders. This is a moment that challenges us to prove our shared principles and uphold true decentralization while leading the ecosystm forward into a new more resilient future.\n\n\n------------------------- Below should be identical to the last prop. Please Verify -------------------------\n\n# Edit: changing stETH transfer (tx #6) to a lower amount in case proposal 352 passes\n\n## Summary\nThis proposal upgrades the Nouns DAO logic contract to V3. This version introduces the following changes:\n\nProposal editing: adding a new initial state to the proposal lifecycle: “Updatable”, during which proposers can update their proposal's transactions and text description.\nThis feature will be disabled at first and will require a separate proposal to configure the period of the Updatable state.\nPropose by signatures: allowing Nouners and delegates to pool their voting power towards submitting a proposal, by submitting their signature, instead of the current approach where sponsors must delegate their votes to help a proposer achieve threshold.\nThis feature will be activated once this proposal executes.\nObjection-only period: a conditional voting period that gets activated upon a “last-minute” proposal swing from defeated to successful, affording voters more reaction time. Only against votes are possible during the objection period.\nThis feature will be disabled at first and will require a separate proposal to enable it and configure its parameters.\nVotes snapshot after voting delay: moving votes snapshot up, to provide Nouners with reaction time per proposal, to get their votes ready (e.g. some might want to move their delegations around). Currently the vote snapshot block is the proposal creation block.\nNouns Fork: allowing Nouners to exit the DAO by forking to a new DAO. Current threshold is set at 20%. For more details please read the tech spec and this post.\nAn updated version of nouns.wtf will be deployed to add support for these features.\n\nAudit\nThe DAO funded two audits for this version, first with Spearbit and then with code4rena.\nBelow is a summary of the results with links to the reports.\n\nPlease reach out to us (verbs team) if you have any questions regarding the findings.\n\nSpearbit found:\n\n0 critical risk severity issues\n2 high risk severity issues\n18 medium risk severity issues\n22 low risk severity issues\nFor more info: the full Spearbit audit report.\n\ncode4rena found:\n\n1 high risk finding\n3 medium risk findings\n8 low risk findings\nFor more info: the full code4rena audit report.\n\nWon’t Fix Issues\nThere were some issues we chose to not fix despite agreeing they were good findings, because we wanted to avoid adding further risk or time delays. We’re listing those here explicitly for the sake of max transparency. There were other issues we did not fix because we disagreed with the auditors’ analysis, and those are not listed here.\n\nSetting a new fork escrow contract might lead to lost tokens\nProposals can move from Expired state back to Queued when timelock’s Grace Period changes\nChanges in detail\nProposal editing\nProposals get voter feedback almost entirely only once they are onchain. At the same time, proposers are reluctant to cancel and resubmit their proposals for multiple reasons, e.g. prefering to avoid restarting the proposal lifecycle and thus delay funding.\n\nThere have been cases where proposers made promises offchain, e.g. to return part of the funds, but that is not captured onchain, and not visible to the entire voter base.\n\nThis feature introduces a new state into the proposal lifecycle:\n\nUpdatable (new) → Pending → Active …\nDuring the Updatable state, a proposer can update their proposal’s description and/or transactions. Following the Updatable state, there’s a Pending state during which updates are no longer available before voting starts during the Active state.\n\nThe length of the Updatable state is configurable by the DAO, and starts at zero. This effectively keeps the feature disabled. A separate proposal will follow with proposed periods for the state, for example: Updatable: 5 days, Pending: 1 day\n\nThere’s also an onchain method of providing feedback to proposals while they are in the Updatable state.\n\nPropose by signatures\nProposal threshold is the number of votes an account must control in order to submit a proposal. As of this writing an account must have at least 2 votes to pass the threshold.\n\nCurrent methods of sponsoring a proposal and their problems:\n\nNouners today either delegate their Nouns to proposers or submit the proposal on their behalf.\nDelegating is limited to Nouners, since delegates can re-delegate their vote to another account.\nWhen a Nouner delegates, they can’t use their voting power for the length of the proposal lifecycle which is very inconvenient.\n\nIf a Nouner/delegate chooses to submit a proposal on behalf of the proposer, we lose the meaning of who is the actual proposer and also the process itself can be cumbersome where the delegate needs to make sure the proposal looks good and pay gas for it.\n\nThis upgrade introduces a new function to the DAO contract: proposeBySigs.\nThis allows anyone to submit a proposal and a set of signatures. The signatures are provided by voters and need to match the proposal content. If the sum of votes from all the signers surpasses proposal threshold, the proposal can be submitted.\n\nThe goal is to open another channel through which proposers can submit proposals, without necessarily finding a sponsor through private channels.\n\nVoters can only be signers if they don’t currently have an active proposal, either as a proposer or signer. Signers of a proposal can cancel it at any time, and the same is true for proposers; proposers should choose their signers carefully.\n\nThis allows both Nouners and delegates to “sign-off” on a proposal, while the proposer address remains the actual proposer and without the need to change delegations.\nIt also allows pooling voting power, e.g. two delegates with 1 vote each can sign a proposal in order for it to pass the proposal threshold, currently at 2 votes.\nIt also opens the door to raising the proposal threshold since it’s easier to collect voting power.\n\nAs part of this update we are adding support for “proposal candidates” to nouns.wtf, where proposers can submit their proposals and request signatures. In order to prevent spam, creating a candidate proposal requires either holding 1 vote or sending 0.1 ETH (the ETH recipient and the amount are configurable by the DAO).\nThe candidate proposals data are submitted to a side contract to make this data publicly available for any frontend to interact with.\n\nObjection-only period\nThe goal is to protect the DAO from executing proposals that the majority would not want to execute. The threat is one where a minority trying to pass a proposal can let the proposal look like it's failing, to cultivate voter apathy, then cast many of their For votes just before voting ends, swinging the proposal from defeated to successful, leaving the majority wishing they were more vigilant.\n\nThis upgrade introduces a new state in the proposal lifecycle: ObjectionPeriod.\n\n… Active (regular voting period) → ObjectionPeriod (conditional) → Succeeded / Defeated \\\nObjectionPeriod gets turned on only if a proposal turns from not passing to passing close enough to the end of the voting period.\n\nDuring the ObjectionPeriod state, only voters who haven’t voted yet are allowed to vote, but only against the proposal.\n\nQ: Why not allow voting For a proposal during this extra voting period?\nA: Similar to the attack scenario described above, it would still allow voters to keep their votes to themselves and vote only at the last minute. In this case it would be right before the ObjectionPeriod ends.\n\nMore broadly speaking, the risk that a proposal passes when it shouldn’t, is much higher than the risk of a proposal not passing when it should.\nA proposal can be re-proposed, but a proposal that passes can’t be reversed.\n\nDAO configurable parameters:\n\nobjectionPeriodDurationInBlocks: how long the objection period lasts, e.g. 2 days\nlastMinuteWindowInBlocks: what is considered “last minute”? e.g. 2 hours\nBoth parameters start with values of zero, effectively making this feature disabled. A separate proposal will follow turning on this feature with suggested parameters.\n\nVotes Snapshot After Voting Delay\nThe current DAO implementation takes a snapshot of votes & delegation at the block a proposal is created, meaning Nouners have no lead time to put their votes in order, e.g. moving their delegations back to themselves to vote on something they really care about.\n\nThis upgrade changes the snapshot to be after the voting delay, i.e. once voting starts. Nouners will now have the duration of voting delay to transfer, buy, sell, delegate and undelegate their votes.\n\nBecause the nouns supply grows during the voting delay, nouns that are minted during the voting delay also participate in voting. Originally the snapshot was taken during proposal creation in order to align the total supply and the quorum and proposal calculations, which are performed at proposal creation time. Now that the supply has grown, this inconsistency is insignificant.\n\nNouns Fork\nFurther details can be found here in the tech spec and this post.\n\nNew treasury\nThe DAO fork feature requires switching to a new treasury contract which allows the DAO to transfer ETH and ERC20 tokens when a fork executes. The current treasury (treasury v1) contract is not upgradable, so it requires a migration to a new one. The new treasury (treasury v2), deployed at 0xb1a32FC9F9D8b2cf86C068Cae13108809547ef71, adds the new functions to the existing contract, and is upgradable to avoid the need for migrations in the future.\n\nThe migration includes:\n\nTransferring ETH, stETH, wstETH, rETH & USDC\nChanging ownership of the auction house, auction house proxy admin, nouns token & nouns descriptor contracts\nChange ownership of TokenBuyer and Payer to allow treasury v2 to perform ETH/USDC swaps\nApprove the treasury v2 to transfer lil nouns from treasury v1\nOther assets in treasury v1 can be moved or approved to be moved in follow up proposals. Only assets in treasury v2 are included in the treasury forking in case of a fork.\n\nDAO proposals are limited to 10 transactions, therefore we are doing the migration in two steps. There will be a follow up proposal with the second part of the migration. The follow up proposal will go onchain once this one executes.\n\nThe DAO will still have access to the original treasury (treasury v1), by proposing proposals via the proposeOnTimelockV1 function.\n\nExisting streams created by the DAO will remain controlled by treasury v1. If the DAO chooses to cancel them, the proposeOnTimelockV1 function will need to be used.\n\nImportant heads up\nProposals that are queued but not yet executed before this proposal executes will need to be executed using the executeOnTimelockV1 function. The regular execute function will attempt to execute via treasury v2 and will fail.\n\nProposal #1 Transactions (this proposal):\nSend 2,500 ETH to new treasury contract\nThe rest of the ETH will be transferred in a followup proposal. We can’t tell in advance how much ETH the treasury will have at the moment this proposal executes so we are sending a first chunk now.\nUpgrade the DAO contract logic to V3\nSet the fork params:\na. forkEscrow: the escrow contract\nb. forkDeployer: the contract which deploys new forked DAOs\nc. erc20TokensToIncludeInFork: addresses of erc20 tokens which will be included in the treasury fork, specifically: stETH, wstETH, rETH and USDC\nd. forkPeriod: the period during which token holders can join a fork after it has been executed, 7 days\ne. forkThresholdBPS: the % of nouns required to surpass in order to activate a fork, 2,000 bps = 20%\nSet the proposal id at which the vote snapshot will be changed to be after voting delay\na.

as much as sentiment is struggling, the dao still passed a ton of props this year including the last two months) then the dao might just let it slide. but if it truly becomes successful at meaningfully interrupting substantially all funding activity, then the flood gates of defense mechanisms open up.\n\nwe could vote to continuously send excess eth to a time locked smart contract to erase the arb profit as charlie suggested in his blog post. we could attempt mutual destruction buy purchasing a high priced nft or even choosing to burn the eth. we could even do something more akin to \"slashing\" by identifying the portion of the dao that has substantially voted against all recent props  and passing a prop to send the entire treasury eth to a fork dao and assigning ownership of all the identified attacker tokens IDs in the fork dao to the treasury (deleting attacker ownership). that would mean not only the arb profit gone but the entire principal involved in the attack to be zeroed and actually just become a donation to the dao. the world would also not be very confused in figuring out what the legitimate dao is in that case so we'll just continue onward with our provenance. \n\nthe moral of the story is that you're absolutely not safe until you actually *completely* capture the dao. even if you're 1% less than that target the super frustrated dao could totally retaliate and you don't have a way of stopping spending without frustrating the dao. \n\nscenario 2: you silently continue to accumulate without any attempt to block or reduce spending.\n\nin this case you're arb profits are still absolutely at risk. any prop that spends eth is reducing the book value of all nouns thus reducing your per noun arb profit (percentage return on capital invested in the arb).\n\none could argue that well, while they lose on percentage returns, they could still be interested in increasing their absolute eth profit and continue for that reason. well note that as your position grows, the portion of dao treasury expenses that you're financing (in reduced total arb profit) also grows linearly.\n\nlet's actually just do some rough back of napkin style math. this year our monthly eth spend has been roughly the same as the monthly auction revenue (treasury eth amount has been roughly flat; source: https://dune.com/hildobby/nouns). for easy round numbers let's say nouns are sold every day at 30 ETH and the book value is 35 ETH. our monthly spend in this case is 900 ETH (assuming monthly spend = monthly auction revenue). if you hold 20% of the supply then you're paying for 20% (180 ETH) of that 900 ETH expense. in other words every day that you continue the arb you have a chance at making 5 ETH more (gap between book value and auction price) but you're on average losing 6 ETH per day (180 ETH / 30 days). \n\nthus it's not economically rationale to continue in both percentage of return terms AND absolute total profit terms unless you can meaningfully reduce spending (but note that spending this year didn't really stop even with the arbers trying and we analyzed in scenario #1 the added risks arbers would be facing such as slashing by further frustrating the dao).\n\nfor these reasons I don't think the new attack vector raised is really viable and doesn't change my view on v3 being the right path forward. \n\nP.S. just one last note on the dao capture situation. this attack vector is already alive and well without the fork and I would argue our options are worse without the fork. if someone has 40%+ voting power then while they can't unilaterally pass any prop b/c of veto, they can absolutely reject every prop. we have no recourse here. they can ask for their \"share\" of the treasury. they could ask for more. we have no other recourse than to accept their terms or else the dao is permanently bricked. imo it's naive to assume to that in the current mode only economically irrational actors would attack the dao. it can be absolutely rational to capture the dao even without the fork if you can get a low enough cost basis since you can take the entire treasury hostage and negotiate with the dao for a profit. the only real defense here is something like the fork that limits the damages to their \"share\" of the treasury and ultimately not having auction prices dip too far below the book value (which the fork mechanism contributes to as well). in a way there's a viewpoint one can have that creating market competition amongst arbers through something like the fork mechanism ensures that the cost of such a capture attack remains reasonably high at all times.

It is operating under a facade of procedural justice. The current voting outcomes are a result of this abuse. We do not recognize the legitimacy of all previous community votes related to the Fork feature, as they violate procedural rules and only lead to increased uncertainty, division, and a breakdown of trust within NounsDAO.\n\nThis abuse manifests on two levels:\n\n\n**1.Proposal 356 bundles multiple proposals together.**\nProposals 353, 354, and 356 combine two distinctly different topics and levels of importance. This raises the question: Should we, during significant constitutional reforms, bundle distinct and important proposals together for community discussion?\n\nTreating the Fork and V3 other features as two separate proposals is essential. The Fork proposal is a constitutional-level reform, the focal point of community disagreements, as its outcome will directly alter Nouns' foundational incentive mechanisms and organizational structure. On the other hand, the V3 feature upgrade will change the interaction flow for governance participants.\n\nTwo proposals with distinctly different objectives are bundled together. One addresses fundamental changes to the underlying incentive system, fraught with significant contradictions; the other optimizes governance processes, which seems beneficial. Combining these two muddles the discourse around Proposal 356, preventing a clear and rational discussion of its pros and cons. For governance researchers, such mixed proposals are extremely frustrating. Garbage in, garbage out. This is one consequence of the abuse of agenda-setting power.\n\n\n**2.More crucially, the NounsDAO Fork proposal bypassed the regular procedure and should not have been proposed by just one team.**\nFrom its inception to its implementation, the Fork feature was emotionally driven, sidestepping the intended process. After Proposal 248's Rage Quit, a utopian voice emerged in the community, envisioning an infinitely forked NounsDAO future. Two emotional currents hastily pushed out the NounsDAO Fork feature, **bypassing the regular procedure.**\n\nNow, it's evident that the hastily introduced mechanism has significant issues. It has attracted arbitrageurs, undermining foundational governance. On-chain data clearly supports this perspective. Since May, the number of Nouns holders has stagnated: 392 holders on May 1st and 392 on August 21st. Most Nouns in the past four months have been snagged by arbitrageurs.\n\n**The current NounsDAO is under attack. It's evident that the Fork mechanism has serious issues, a fact supported by clear data, rather than sensationalized stories.**\n\nUntil a credible-neutrality solution emerges, terms like \"decentralization,\" \"adventurous spirit,\" \"culture,\" and \"global public goods movement\" are just marketing narratives. We need to pause, revert the NounsDAO Fork feature to the research phase.\n\nThe right process should resemble Proposal 216: \"Mandated Round: Private Voting Research Sprint\". Engage multiple teams, foster innovation, and present diverse forking solutions. Instead, the Verb team, already overwhelmed, was pushed by community anxiety to offer an over-engineered Fork solution that arbitrageurs are now exploiting.\n\nWe are being forced to accept a flawed proposal and then debate and take sides. This is another consequence of agenda-setting power abuse.\n\n\nNow, pro-fork arbitrageurs might have more than 100 votes, which is very risky. **We strongly urge all independent Nouners, not swayed by vested interests, to vote against Proposal 356 and follow these steps:**\n\n1. **Reject Proposal 356. Propose a V3 upgrade without the Nouns Fork and proceed with regular upgrades.**\n2. **Revert the Fork feature to the research phase, initiate a DAOFork Research Sprint, solicit research from various teams, and re-advance the proposal.**"},{"support":1,"voter":"0x8d2B28265bEE1C926433A25D951adb03De9Ab275","numberOfVotes":2,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x9DbC5E35a2f1A6dC214Bdb7ed7a8c706D77f0A74","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":0,"voter":"0x3F7a3DF9c6F5574b6E67FB26955b75E52a4E2b7e","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":0,"voter":"0x3B60e31CFC48a9074CD5bEbb26C9EAa77650a43F","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":"I'm FOR upgrading to V3 but not with this preamble.

If an arbitrage opportunity exists, it will be pursued. Nouns should be resilient to arbitrage, instead of being vulnerable to it or treating it adversarially. While I’m personally not a fan of arbitrage, it will always exist, and should be addressed in the DAO’s design. The best way to address this is in two ways: increasing spending and increasing uncertainty.\n\nnoun40 makes many thoughtful points here, especially on spending. As noun40 points out, spending makes arbitrage less profitable. Ensuring that Nouns does not hold a significant treasury, but instead spends its revenue relatively quickly, would ensure that arbitrage opportunities are minimal. There is no reason that Nouns should sit on a substantial treasury. It's arguably better to inject ETH into the market now, given the scarcity of funding, than to hoard it and spend reluctantly. Nouns has the opportunity to keep builders and artists in the ecosystem and to make it viable for them to participate for the long-term.\n\nNouns should spend more, it should spend quickly, and it should take into account that funding deployed now is more valuable to the ecosystem than funding deployed later. Given the time value of money, spending now yields the greatest impact. While it is of course important to spend well, and ensure that funds go to the right places, there are many good actors ready to absorb the $50M of liquidity that Nouns holds. If a portion of that is misused, it is still less expensive than the costs of enforcement. Enforcement around spending, or not spending at all, is very likely more costly in terms of impact than spending misuse. If $49M goes to good actors and $1M is wasted, that is better than barely spending at all. Cherry picked examples of waste will always be touted on Twitter, but the alternatives are worse.\n\nIn addition to spending, Nouns has another mechanism that it should leverage: uncertainty. Right now, it’s possible to estimate how many days Nouns has until arbitragers have a majority of votes. (There will be ambiguity here from groups that don’t vote, but it’s relatively easy to estimate a range here.) If Nouns are below “book value”, then arbitrage is nearly guaranteed. Nouns can raise these costs, however, by adding uncertainty. As I write this, the odds of a fork are very close to guaranteed. If someone is buying Nouns for an arbitrage opportunity and there is a 90+% chance of a fork, arbitrage looks very appealing. By reducing the certainty of a fork, we can raise the costs of arbitrage.\n\nNouns has an excellent mechanism for injecting uncertainty: the Nouns Foundation veto. The veto is relatively open-ended, and specifically mentions the possibility of a veto for using the Nouns treasury for personal gain. Announcing that the veto will be considered for future forks, without committing to a particular path, will reduce the expected value of any arbitrage. This can be dialed in based on messaging — stronger statements will hold more sway, as well statements with greater specificity. We can inject uncertainty without resorting to more desperate measures, like burning or slashing. Simply announcing the possibility of a veto and letting the arbitragers incorporate that uncertainty will reduce the expected value of the arbitrage.\n\nNouns should spend more, but it should also ensure that future forks are seen as far from guaranteed. This is a path to a DAO focused on public goods that does not reduce the flexibility that Nouns has or commit to a particular path. I am in favor of the V3 upgrade + the fork, but I encourage Nouns (in particular, the Nouns Foundation) to become more aggressive about arbitrage and reduce its expected value. That will ensure that arbitrage is not guaranteed and make it a less appealing target.\n\nP.S. A brief note on procedural objections:\nI understand the procedural concerns of bundling multiple proposals together, but with the many cancelations of prior V3 upgrade proposals, there was ample opportunity to split these out into separate votes before now. I also understand the concerns about the preamble, which I am not a fan of, but the transaction data is what matters. The preamble is less relevant here, where all of the work to date on V3 speaks for itself."},{"support":1,"voter":"0x3fDe4F78811638D9372cba2b8074ad26AbCE6c71","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":0,"voter":"0x16C88a1f5580d5a6dAE0F7701E0b7C1341B8BFA6","numberOfVotes":6,"reason":"SharkDAO (Nouns #2, #5, #15, #33, #47, & #139) votes Against."},{"support":0,"voter":"0x6b2645b468A828a12fEA8C7D644445eB808Ec2B1","numberOfVotes":32,"reason":"Sent from https://goops.com Nouns Governance Pool"},{"support":1,"voter":"0xDDf2B130c82d9fcdc5C7ca2E78F7Fe2a5A0dF6Fc","numberOfVotes":3,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0xDCb4117e3A00632efCaC3C169E0B23959f555E5e","numberOfVotes":17,"reason":""}]},{"prop":{"id":357,"description":"# Nouns DAO V3 migration cleanup\n\nI propose the second part of the migration as in my understanding everybody just waiting for this upgrade process to fully finish, therefore until it's finally finished the DAO can't function at 100% as the focus is highly diverted on this upgrade process.\nI included all the transactions originally planned, then top of that I added the withdrawal from the Payer contract after there was some argument for it from DAO members.\nThis proposal is submitted less than 2 days after the first upgrade proposal (Prop 356) which means that by the time/if the first one gets executed we will also know if this proposal failed or passed, so basically if this fails the DAO can just resubmit without any delay of the planned process, but if this passes we just saved ourself from another 10 days of headache.\n\nThis proposal contains 10 transactions:\n\n1.Move leftover ETH from treasury v1 to treasury v2\n2.Approve treasury v2 to transfer lil nouns from treasury v1\n3.Transfer ownership of TokenBuyer to treasury v2\n4.Transfer ownership of Payer to treasury v2\n5.Approve unlimited stETH to be transferred by the ERC20Transferer contract\n6.Invoke ERC20Transferer to send remaining stETH to the new treasury\n7.Transfer all wstETH to treasury v2\n8.Transfer all rETH to treasury v2\n9.Transfer all USDC to treasury v2\n10.Withdraw from Payer to treasury v2","proposer":"0x84044988e0754decAa7444d19c8BF069B977F128","startBlock":17962594,"endBlock":17998594,"executed":false},"votes":[]},{"prop":{"id":358,"description":"# Join NOUNS At Your Own Risk; a note on v3 for prospective members\n\nv3 of Nouns (prop 356) implements a standing bid at the protocol level to buy back a block of Nouns ≥ the 'forking threshold' (20% of circulating supply at time of execution) with an equivalent % of the treasury's fungible assets. \n\nWhile this may offer you opportunities to exchange your token for some Eth (and other DAO assets), it also enables, under certain conditions, other Noun holders to bypass the proposal process and partially or fully drain treasury assets, resulting in possible total loss of funds.\n\nThe Foundation veto and/or exiting (by signaling an interest to join a block sale) will not be able to prevent this in all cases.

The Nouns in Rio team is requesting **9 ETH + 9,500 USDC** to create an engaging Prop House Experience in a hub brimming with innovators.\n‎ \n## How 👀\n\nWe plan to create a round in the upcoming Nouns in Rio House and open exclusively* to all [Blockchain Rio](https://blockchainfestival.io/) attendees, a place full of builders aspiring to build for the Web3 ecosystem and push the boundaries of innovation.\n\nA pool of 7 ETH will be designated to back 20 projects, each set to receive 0.35 ETH. Proposals must aim to enhance Prop House in some way, whether through community integration, explainer videos, code development, and more. After the event, Nouners will have a one-week voting window to determine which projects get funded.\n\n**During the event, we'll ask builders interested in submitting a proposal to fill out a form. This ensures that all proposals come from verified event participants.*\n‎ \n![](https://i.imgur.com/8kR9fgd.png)  \n‎ \n## Why 🤔\n\nWe want individuals to recognize Prop House as a platform where they can get funding to bring their ideas to life. By showcasing the diverse groups already benefiting from the platform, we aim to inspire them to consider how they can engage their own communities in similar ways.\n\nThe true value of this experience lies not only in funding individual projects but also in connecting talented builders to the Nouns DAO community. By cultivating this relationship, we create a pathway for ongoing collaboration and innovation, encouraging them to continue contributing to and growing with the community.\n\nCheck out all the amazing things that have come from Prop House. **Nouns has funded one of the best Web3 platforms, and it's high time we spread the word about it.**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/AZR3Lfp.png)\n‎ \n## Where 📍\n\nWe discovered Prop House at an event and from that moment we knew we wanted to create an IRL experience for it. Now, we have the perfect chance. We'll be at the largest Web3 & Business event in Latin America, [Blockchain Rio](https://blockchainfestival.io/), from September 12th to 14th, alongside big names like Polkadot, CoinEx, Polygon, Ledger, and more. It's the ideal place to find passionate builders and introduce them to Prop House.\n\nTake a look at the first edition of the event from 2022, which attracted more than 22,000 visitors, featured 432 speakers, and generated 86 million reais in economic impact for the state of Rio de Janeiro.\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/CODwQjS.gif)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/l3gsmny.png)\n\n*Brazilian builders on stage talking about Nouns and Prop House. [Watch here!](https://twitter.com/blockchain_rio/status/1630946236105736195)* \n‎ \n## Lounge 🛋️\n\nOur lounge will include two interactive totems that enable attendees to explore Prop House and toggle between different houses and rounds. Additionally, two large TVs will display a video produced by us, highlighting projects funded by various communities through Prop House. The lounge backdrop will offer step-by-step instructions, complete with a QR code, for submitting proposals.\n\nAll of this will support the team in explaining what Prop House is and how it works. We'll also **give a talk** at the event and invite people to join the experience and submit their projects.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Ut98dfj.png)\n\n*The layout of the lounge and the art on the backdrop are for illustrative purposes and may not represent the final design.*\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/UNfxWZG.png)\n‎ \n## Team 🤝\n\n[Nouns in Rio](https://twitter.com/NounsInRio) team, represented by [JP](https://twitter.com/home) and [Debinvest](https://twitter.com/debinvest), is behind the project. They will be on-site at the lounge to explain Prop House, discuss the round, and assist with wallet creations and proposal submissions.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/9mp1CbE.png)\n\nNouns in Rio team has successfully organized various nounish IRL events, including [Nouns Week](https://nounsweek.wtf/rio-de-janeiro/), the [Treasure Hunt](https://twitter.com/NounsInRio/status/1574418495911219201), [social actions](https://twitter.com/NounsInRio/status/1606765831064588288) for Prop House's Nounish Holidays and many others.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/WDTRnam.png)\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/uFXRkNX.gif)\n\n*Nouns Week*\n‎ \n## Budget 💰\n\nWith 7 ETH, we can fund a diverse range of projects with a meaningful ETH value. JP and Debinvest will each receive 1 ETH for managing the project and staffing the lounge during the event. The cost for setting up and operating the event space, which includes event fees and production expenses, will be 9,500 USDC. In case fewer than 20 proposals are submitted, **all remaining ETH will be returned to the DAO.**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/HqGnVgI.png)\n‎ \n## Success ✨\n\nAfter the event concludes, we'll provide the DAO with both an aftermovie and a detailed report. This report will feature key metrics like site visits during the event (provided by the Prop House team if possible), submitted proposals, QR code scans, and minted POAPs. We'll also extend an invitation to all funded project leads to join the [Nouns in Rio Discord server](https://discord.gg/yBFRt2D894) for ongoing project follow-up, ensuring sustained engagement and support.\n\nTo amplify our impact, we'll actively engage the community through our Portuguese Nounish channels like [@nounsinrio](instagram.com/nounsinrio), [@nounsbr](instagram.com/nounsbr) and [@thenounsquarebr](https://www.tiktok.com/@thenounsquarebr). The engagement metrics from these channels will be included in our final report.\n\nWe recognize this is a pivotal time for the DAO, but due to the time-sensitive nature of our project, we felt the need to proceed. Thank you for reading and considering this proposal. Let's take Prop House to the streets! 💡\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/dAMtste.gif)","proposer":"0x6ec5A78Ed4755B13A6676dF608125624f66E8fF6","startBlock":18039748,"endBlock":18075748,"executed":false},"votes":[{"support":1,"voter":"0x8d2B28265bEE1C926433A25D951adb03De9Ab275","numberOfVotes":2,"reason":""},{"support":0,"voter":"0x077FE07E30d419Deb781Cb2190684135C4ed93C3","numberOfVotes":3,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0xA86882277E69FbF0a51805cdc8b0a3a113079E63","numberOfVotes":3,"reason":"As previously signalled, happy to support experiments like these.\n\n*voted with Prechain*"},{"support":1,"voter":"0xDCb4117e3A00632efCaC3C169E0B23959f555E5e","numberOfVotes":17,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x5D802e2Fe48392c104Ce0401C7ECa8a4456f1F16","numberOfVotes":3,"reason":"I believe in the Prop House model and the NounsInRio team, so I am voting YES.

Soon with the prop house protocol it will be the case that anyone can create create PH houses/rounds and even create their own sites that interact with those houses/rounds specifically. One of the limitations of the current PH site is that it creates a very nested UI and treats most rounds with a similar UX. There's a big design space for making PH rounds hyper local to a given context (hackathon, grants giving, etc; rio, seoul, etc).

Movements > Marketing.*\n\nSkateboarding and similar subcultures, despite their rise in popularity, grapple with commercial overreach and value retention. Some of the most pressing challenges include:\n\n1. **Commercial Exploitation**: Outside brands jumping into skateboarding often prioritise profit over authenticity.\n2. **Loss of Authenticity**: Many skaters, due to financial pressures, might promote brands they don't genuinely align with.\n3. **Skater Exploitation**: Many skaters, despite their talent, don't receive fair compensation, especially considering the sport's physical demands.\n4. **Mainstream Misrepresentation**: Media portrayals frequently miss the genuine essence of skateboarding, leaning into stereotypes.\n5. **Skatepark Commercialisation**: Once-communal skateparks are becoming increasingly commercialised.\n6. **Core Values vs. Growth**: Balancing foundational skateboarding values with growth opportunities remains a delicate act.\n\nThe skateboarding domain needs a thoughtful equilibrium. Brands that genuinely get and respect the skate culture have the potential to collaboratively benefit both parties without diluting the sport's spirit.\n\n---\n\n## 💡 Proposed Solution\n\n![](https://ipfs.decentralized-content.com/ipfs/bafkreiflj5bgctvmzjujul3kvehilbgrzcag7zhomomfdtrtbit4sptjym)\n\n📝 *Check out the [Meier Skatepark renovation](https://www.gnars.wtf/dao/proposals/3) proposal that's currently being delivered*\n\nEmpowering individuals to step into the blockchain world is central to our mission. Shredders, akin to artists, can undergo transformative experiences through this. Our overarching goal is to amplify our influence, simplify operational processes, and champion those with genuine grassroots credibility.\n\n**GNARS** as an acronym crystallizes our ethos, mirroring the Nouns' virtuous cycle, acting as our serendipity machine:\n\n- **Goodwill**: Renewing skateparks and introducing new, shred-worthy sculptures\n- **Network**: Culturally sensitive contributions earn us both visibility and respect\n- **Advocacy**: Harmonising with communities helps us draw in new enthusiasts\n- **Releases**: Collective creative outputs with shared proceeds bolster funding\n- **Serendipity**: Getting onchain empowers shredders, opening fresh avenues\n\n---\n\n## 🌟 Opportunity\n\n![](https://ipfs.decentralized-content.com/ipfs/bafkreihhjrjim3rtjd6k2drh6r5gpy5i7xfp22gjcuouujecd2p4arkxhq)\n\nOur target of onboarding a million shredders might seem lofty, but it's just a fraction - 0.2% - of the 490 million participants in extreme sports.\n\nTo provide some perspective, skateboarding alone boasts 85 million participants.

Secure permissions for QR/NFC plaques.\n- **Community Consultation**: Prioritise feedback, ensuring final outputs align with community needs and aspirations.\n- **Skateable Art**: Commission designs that are both visually appealing and skateable, enhancing park functionality.\n- **Skate Community Collaborations**: Organise events to spotlight our mission. Rope in local influencers as ambassadors.\n- **Educational Initiatives**: Engage with schools and clubs, emphasising the interplay of art, skateboarding, and community projects.\n- **Media Outreach**: Use local media to showcase project completions and events, underscoring our tech integrations.\n- **Feedback Mechanisms**: Use digital tools to gauge user engagement and gather feedback, refining future strategies.\n\nOur dual focus on the skateboarding community and local councils ensures that our initiatives resonate with authentic cultural value.\n\n---\n\n## 📊 Budget Breakdown\n\n![](https://ipfs.decentralized-content.com/ipfs/bafybeihebdyhnukubmcxl3tkhlqrn3dzwx5ace6uck2l2cd6ggb6tdq72i)\n\nPer the TLDR, our ask is 200 ETH to our treausury (DAO executor) at `gnars.eth`, outlined as:\n\n- **Continuous park enhancements - 150 ETH**\n    - Skate and other terrain park refurbishments globally\n    - Shred-worthy Nouns themed sculpture fabrications\n    - Installs of commemorative QR/NFC enabled plaques\n    - Unveiling and onboarding events fully documented\n    - Releases of all works onchain as paid or free mints\n    - All mint proceeds split with creators and treasury\n    - Being enabled by Nouns is core to Gnars' story\n- **Administration of GNARS strategy - 42 ETH**\n    - Coordinate community-driven promotional activities\n    - Manage various Gnars Media House curatorial efforts\n    - Oversee day to day operations and general administration\n    - Experiment with retro rewards (up to 2 ETH/month/contributor)\n    - Community discord moderation and shredder onboarding\n    - Collaborate with Rainbow wallet on QR / NFC activations\n    - Disburse free Gnars (10%) from multisig for shredders\n    - Provide assistance to our pods and working groups\n- **Migrate Gnars to Zora Network - 8 ETH**\n    - Add a timelock period/minimum quorum before new DAO opens up for props so nobody captures the first few props\n    - Deploy all contracts to Zora\n    - Edit frontend to integrate with Zora\n    - Migrate subgraph\n    - Implement gnars claiming process\n    - Plan for treasury migration\n    - Complete full migration\n\n📝 *Through onchain governance we will allocate funds as earmarked and will be experimenting with Partitions for a holistic approach to treasury management.

When requested in larger sums, it can have material $ impact operationally (for e.g. ETH dropping 100$ a matter of days and a request for 200ETH is a 20k delta. I am assuming Gnars is aware of that risk and funding any differential out of pocket. I really wish this was requested in USDC instead of vague lump-sum ETH denominated ask. \n\n- Assuming Nouns is funding the OpEx mentioned here, what is the timeline behind it? Is it done over course of a month, 6 months, a year? Not having clarity on that front makes it unclear what the run-rate really is for the subDAO.\n\nMany Nouners will likely not backchannel asking for details like that if its missing in the proposal and its good practice to include it wherever possible. \nNot opposed to funding Gnars, but I will be no on this specific one for my above mentioned reasons. \n\nI understand this will pass anyways, but something to consider for future Gnars proposals.

The Small Grants Committee (later known as NSFW) and Prop House rounds have fueled considerable community contributions, propelling the protocol's momentum. Yet, during the latter half of Nouns Season 2, obtaining small grants grew challenging. Additionally, the continuous management of Prop House Rounds demands consistent coordination.\n\nWe want to help patch this bug in the protocol, and bring back the Builder-forward Nounish Vibes that brought many of us here in the first place.\n\nWe are a trusted group of contributors in the ecosystem who are willing to collectively take on the challenge of running a dynamic and transparent Small Grants Allocation Pod, as well as coordinating and championing a series of exciting biweekly Prop House Rounds over the next six months of Nouns Season 3. \n\n[![s2-noggles.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/W4SHH2bj/s2-noggles.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/SX2dXbMt)\n\n---\n\n## **THE PLAN**\n\n1. Coordinate with the Prop House team to set up two new \"Season 3 Grants\" Infinite Rounds, where anyone in the ecosystem can apply for retroactive funding up to a maximum of 5 ETH or proactive funding up to a maximum of 1 ETH. Our team will review grant applications on a rolling week-by-week basis, with a goal to allocate ~14 ETH per month.  \n2. Coordinate and champion a series of Biweekly Temporal Nouns Prop House Rounds, alternating between Open Grants Rounds and Themed Grants Rounds such as “Visual Arts”, “Keep Nouns Weird”, “Gaming/Esports”, “CC0 Music”, “Public Goods,” “Media and Content,” etc. We plan to explore various token-voting methods across all the Prop House rounds we run over the next 6 months, engaging the wider nounish community in some cases.\n3. Maintain a [Public-facing Discord](https://discord.gg/qmN4sfsXmh) for community members to ask questions and receive feedback on their applications while also using Prop House’s built-in comment functionality to provide ongoing transparent, public feedback on builder ideas. \n4.

CoW Protocol uniquely allows its users to get best execution prices even with a lax slippage tolerance thanks to 15 competitive solvers participating in an auction mechanism that protects the users by granting the right to execute the trade to the solver offering maximal price improvement.\n\nCoW Protocol is used by a [number of DAOs](https://cow.fi/daos) for their trading operations including ENS, Aave, Nexus Mutual, Gnosis, Karpatkey, Olympus DAO, Badger DAO, Yearn and more. \n\n## Advantages\n\nCoW Protocol pioneered intent-based trading since its inception in early 2021. This allows users to define order parameters without specifying the actual execution path (`calldata`). Users should expect the most optimised execution route to be chosen by the winning solver at the time of execution. \n\n## Considerations\n\nGiven a sell order of 500 wstETH→rETH there are several options for order placement that can provide different properties. We'll focus on a *TWAP* order setup although it seems to not be necessary in a smaller 500 ETH trade - the purpose is to demonstrate how a larger order could be set up.\n\nFor a 500 wstETH→rETH we propose to use a TWAP order of 5 equal parts worth 100 wstETH each. This may result in an execution up to 525 rETH.\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BJfUbBKo2.png)\n\n### `TWAP` Conditional order\n\n* Launch date: August 17th, 2023. [See twitter post.](https://twitter.com/CoWSwap/status/1692152855694803112?s=20)\n* Transactional volume: ~$4.2M. [See dune query](https://dune.com/cowprotocol/cow-swap-limit-orders-kpis).\n* Value held within `ExtensibleFallbackHandler`-upgraded Safes: ~$12.3M\n\nThe TWAP [implementation](https://github.com/cowprotocol/composable-cow) uses a constant limit price across each. Given the stability of wstETH→rETH, the limit price may be set in advance with a high confidence that this will be representative at the time the proposal is executed (and for the duration of the TWAP).\n\nOrder parameters suggested for this proposal:\n* Limit price: 1 wstETH = 1.038 rETH. This includes 1% slippage tolerance to allow for charging a fee from the sell token and to get higher confidence in execution. **It is still expected to be executed with a much lower slippage in practice.** See the above mentioned dune dashboard's *'order surplus'* whereby the order's slippage is protected.\n* 5 equal parts of 100 wstETH\n* Time intervals of two hours between parts \n\n## Methodology\n\nTo achieve this TWAP, the proposed transaction bundle will:\n\n1. Wrap the required `stETH` to `wstETH` so that it may be traded.\n2. Create a `Safe` owned by the DAO treasury that is used as a staging contract for the TWAP.\n3. Trigger the TWAP, with the resulting `rETH` from each swap being sent directly back to the DAO treasury.\n\n### Use of `Safe`\n\n* Developers: `Safe`\n* Audits: [See their Github Repository](https://github.com/safe-global/safe-contracts/tree/af488f0a649a3be2ea01e0f7a6af1587d0250c2d/docs).\n\nThe `Safe` is used as a staging area for the funds used in the TWAP. As CoW Protocol uses intent based trading, the `owner` of the order needs to sign their intent (done using a private key for an `EOA`, done using [EIP-1271](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1271) for a smart contract). \n\nWith this requirement in mind, the DAO treasury contract for Nouns doesn't support EIP-1271. This is why a `Safe` is used in combination with `ComposableCoW` (detailed below).\n\nThe `Safe` that is created in the proposal bundle **ensures that the only owner is set to the DAO Treasury**. At all times, the funds remain under the direct control of the DAO treasury with the same timelock conditions.\n\n#### Execution Risk\n\nIn the transaction bundle funds are sent atomically to a newly created `Safe`. This means that the `Safe`'s address needs to be calculated beforehand. This is done using `CREATE2` logic, therefore the `Safe` is created at a deterministic address. The flow:\n\n1. DAO Treasury sets an approval on `wstETH` for the to-be-created `Safe`.\n2. The `Safe` is created and initialised.\n3. The funds are **PULLED** from the DAO Treasury to the `Safe`.\n\nCritically, with the above methodology there is *no ability for funds to be sent to an address where they are not retrievable*.\n\n**CAUTION:** This candidate proposal assumes successful passage of [Proposal #359](https://nouns.wtf/vote/359) **AND** no intermediate proposal that interacts with the new treasury's balance of `wstETH`.\n\n### Use of `ComposableCoW` / `TWAP`\n\n* Developer: mfw78 (funded by CowDAO Grants Program, and now a [Core Contributor to CoW Protocol](https://snapshot.org/#/cowgrants.eth/proposal/0x0202a88c6792d1bd1e534cf1da94769130f495e72247e666b4afff8b22da9db0)).\n* Audits (jointly funded by `Safe` and CoW Protocol): [Ackee](https://github.com/cowprotocol/composable-cow/blob/main/audits/ackee-blockchain-cow-protocol-composablecow-extensiblefallbackhandler-report-1.2.pdf), [Gnosis Internal](https://github.com/cowprotocol/composable-cow/blob/main/audits/gnosis-ComposableCoWMayJul2023.pdf).\n* Other: Repository recently on-boarded to [CoW Protocol GitHub organisation](https://github.com/cowprotocol/).\n\n`ComposableCoW` is a conditional smart order framework that was [incubated by the CoW Grants Program](https://snapshot.org/#/cowgrants.eth/proposal/0xb7815ca1f5aea2ec537295fd452332680eb1be379f3356950dc8ba151d83f9c5). `TWAP` is an order type implemented in the `ComposableCoW` framework. The contracts are thoroughly tested and audited. To date, volume processed exceeds ~$4.2M.\n\nUsing `ComposableCoW`, a smart contract (such as the `Safe` deployed in the proposal) is able to autonomously indicate its intent to trade. This intent is monitored by a *Watch Tower* (currently a Tenderly Web3 Action, deployed by the CoW Protocol team), with the intent relayed to the CoW Protocol API. In this framework - for TWAP, unlike `Milkman` - the smart contract specifies the *entire order structure to be submitted to the API*. There are no trust assumptions placed in the Watch Tower (besides the Watch Tower not running, leading to a griefing attack, but CoW Protocol for reputational reasons are incentivised to keep the Watch Tower operational).\n\n#### Differences compared to `Milkman`\n\nBoth were funded by the CoW Protocol Grants Program. `Milkman` seeks to solve the issue of an autonomous swap from ABC→XYZ tokens, whereas `ComposableCoW` provides an entire framework for producing *conditional* orders. TWAP is an example of a conditional order built with this framework - allowing a large trade to settle in multiple parts over time, minimising price impact.\n\n## Proposal Operations\n\nThe operations in the proposal are:\n\n1. Approve the required amount of `stETH` for wrapping into `wstETH`.\n2. Wrap `stETH` into `wstETH`.\n3. Approve the to-be-created Safe to use the Executor's `wstETH`.\n4. Create the trading `Safe` (owner: Exector, owners: 1).\n5. Configure the `Safe`:\n    i. Set `ComposableCoW` as the domain verifier for `GPv2Settlement` (CoW Protocol signing).\n    ii. Set the allowance for `GPv2VaultRelayer` to spend `wstETH` held by the `Safe`.\n    iii. Use `transferFrom` to pull funds from the `Executor` which what was already approved at (3).\n    iv. Create the `TWAP` order\n6. Confirm revocation of all allowances that were given to the `Safe` by the `Executor`.\n","proposer":"0x29104bb91ADA737a89393c78335e48fF4708727E","startBlock":18122105,"endBlock":18158105,"executed":false},"votes":[{"support":1,"voter":"0x4754b7e3DEde42D71d6c92978f25F306176EC7e9","numberOfVotes":4,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0xFC218F1164cfEf8e4EC7c2aca8fB019DC8976214","numberOfVotes":20,"reason":"(noun40 voting via agora)\n\nCoW TWAP is likely a worthy candidate to test out to compare with TWAMM. TWAMM's design results in less slippage with larger trade amounts due to gas savings (their simulations in prop 320 promised 1.3% slippage at the 500 ETH test amount and 0.5% slippage at the 7k ETH full amount) so it might not be an apples to apples comparison since CoW TWAP doesn't have a similar dynamic of better exec at larger sizes but still if CoW TWAP can deliver lower slippage overall regardless of all the detail then I'm inclined to think it could be the better option.\n\nAlso just worth noting that I don't know if 7k stETH is still the amount we're exploring to trade to rETH given the treasury size is halving with the fork but I think this test is still worthwhile.

Our primary objective is to boost voter participation by providing Nouners with a user-friendly app that simplifies interactions with the Nouns protocol. We firmly believe that casting votes should be as effortless as sending a text message.\nThe core features will empower Nouners and community members to access the latest information and interact seamlessly with the Nouns protocol. Additionally, our experimental features will open doors to new onboarding methods, enhance community engagement and discover new utility. This app will be a valuable addition to existing governance clients, such as Nounsagora, Voter, Mmmogu, Nounoclock, Shenounigans, and many others.\n\n## Core Features List\n* Feed tab: Featuring the latest community, auction, trade, and proposal information in a clean and concise format.\n* Community tab: Providing an easy and concise way to find Nouners and delegates.\n* Auctions tab: Displaying the latest auction and market information from platforms like Opensea, LooksRare, Blur, etc.\n* Proposals tab: Read, track, and share proposals.\n* Wallet tab: Connect your wallet, check your Noun bags, cast and delegate votes (with Metamask, Rainbow, etc., integration).\n* Push notifications: A flexible notifications center for all activities, including notifications for specific trait minting, trades, delegations, etc.\n\n## Experimental Features\n* AirPlay support: Stream \"A Nouns Movie: Rise of Blus\" from the app to a monitor or TV.\n* Maps support: Display cities where Nouners and community members travel and reside (limited to locality).\n* NFTs: Distribute commemorative NFTs to active participants (those who check auctions more than three times a week receive a code to mint a unique Nounish NFT).\n\n## Timeline\n* Core features delivered in 1-2 months\n* Experimental Features in 4 months\n\n## Git repo\n* We welcome PRs at\nhttps://github.com/fiveoceans-dev/nouns-mobile/tree/main/ios-swift\n\n## Budget\n10 eth - UI design\n15 eth - retrofund\n30 eth - R&D next 5 months\n12 eth - maintanance ∞\n**Total: 67 eth**\n\n## Transaction\n\nSend 67 eth to [Five](https://twitter.com/fiveoceans_dev)\n0x7Bd4cdbD92ab09fA689ED899cddDD6ECCFeF7a54\n\n## Screenshots\n* ### Splash screen\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/Hy-zc4OR2.gif)\n\n* ### Auction\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HklGc4_Rn.gif)\n\n* ### Proposals\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BklzcVO0n.gif)\n\n* ### Wallet\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/S1Jf5EuC2.gif)","proposer":"0x7Bd4cdbD92ab09fA689ED899cddDD6ECCFeF7a54","startBlock":18131060,"endBlock":18167060,"executed":false},"votes":[{"support":0,"voter":"0x008c84421dA5527F462886cEc43D2717B686A7e4","numberOfVotes":11,"reason":"We don't have enough demand for this and it doesn't solve enough of a constraint to be valuable to the DAO.

There’s a palpable tension and curiosity in that single frame that makes us **care**. \n\nI want to bring that to a fun art project focused on a pair of Nouns - Chip and Benny - and their adventures in the - slightly (or sometimes *very*) heightened and over-the-top - world of ‘**Noun en Scène**’.\n\n![](https://ipfs.decentralized-content.com/ipfs/bafkreidmghr5rzmqwejtz5gwvnlmyrmnbzf7noty6mb5b7ykcgyqln5veu)\n\nThink of it as a cinematic one-shot storytelling project that takes our pixelated, digital little Nouns, turns them into real life ‘muppet’-like puppets and then throws them into film scenes with flesh and blood people.\n\n![](https://ipfs.decentralized-content.com/ipfs/bafkreieoo7k4u7uen4d7slr6kt7re2234xtivk7sybo3j4z72buzpgueju)\n(*cinematic scenes that make you ask questions and keep looking*)\n\nEvery one-shot tosses our sweet, little Nouns into a new dramatic scene where they're forced to deal with the crazy situation they've gotten themselves into by trying to help or do a good deed for a random human they've met. \n\nAnd through these scenic moments, the world of Chip, Benny and the 'Noun en Scène' project will grow, evolve and hopefully become something people want to see more of!\n\n![](https://ipfs.decentralized-content.com/ipfs/bafkreia25gd5kfdglu52e2jakou3luj4neyzse52jgeelpvti57o2jojwi)\n\nBy utilizing ‘muppet’-like characters mixed with real people and heightened, cinematically-lit scenes, the absurdity and beauty of life will become that much more stark, profound and hopefully very funny. \n\nTaking cues and paying homage to a variety of influences including Alex Prager, The Far Side, world cinema, the Kermitage Collection and many more, this project aims to utilize a couple Nouns to create captivating characters we just can’t get enough of. \n\n![](https://ipfs.decentralized-content.com/ipfs/bafybeifed3xlopidln4j4mieislub2pq4txtoealf6cvswxew6f7dlsxky)\n![](https://ipfs.decentralized-content.com/ipfs/bafkreif6ubfkoutleoqfxdhqctt2cdqwuidral6csbcp2k74brj32ahdai)\n![](https://ipfs.decentralized-content.com/ipfs/bafkreieoelw5lordgtyffzqby2pwjfs6u6crdhagk4t24mjgqlxma2wqrq)\n![](https://ipfs.decentralized-content.com/ipfs/bafkreibkhnf5lwzniwisn7jgzyxmk6ujnenj7gozeib4j7whkgndu3thaa)\n\nChip and Benny are just a couple innocent, little guys trying to help and do good in the world, but instead they keep finding themselves entangled in situations way beyond their depth. \n\n![](https://ipfs.decentralized-content.com/ipfs/bafkreihyboig23zcntxs4mhhqkwyeqfzb3nnj7kq7bsfbbf5nwdbbwxlvy)\n\n# **COOL. SO WHAT’S THE PLAN?**\n---\n\nThese shoots will be treated like an indie film production - the difference being that we are capturing **single shots** that tell full, rich stories while still requiring casting, makeup, lighting, location scouting/rentals, puppet styling etc. \n\nOn the casting front, while at first it will make sense to work with local working actors/models and friends, as the project gains traction and grows - or when I’m working on my next tv show - I think there is a fun way to bring known name actors into these scenes and add a whole other level of playfulness to the project. \n\nThe first step will be designing, modeling and manufacturing our Noun ‘muppets.’ **Luckily, I’ve gotten a very exciting collaborator on board for this!**\n\n# **PUPPET HEAP!**\n---\n[![](https://ipfs.decentralized-content.com/ipfs/bafkreifgehg3mxpwez6iwiptsiqciuhg4v447nskvqyts6aclxsyxwpqzq)](https://www.youtube.com/embed/agxY_pJwo8o?si=vKyoY-cGw9rH14NI)\n\n\n**Puppet Heap** is a unique design and production studio specializing in storytelling through the creation of iconic characters for all sorts of media including film, television, advertising, theater, and new media. The company was founded by artist, designer, filmmaker, and teacher Paul Andrejco after observing the burgeoning pile of puppets that had accumulated in his Hoboken apartment back in the early ‘90s. Now, just a few blocks away, Puppet Heap is home to teams of artists, designers, writers, and producers creating character based narratives for clients around the world including **The Walt Disney Company, Sesame Workshop, and Nickelodeon**. Puppet Heap has been entrusted with the care, maintenance, and creative support of the Muppets for Disney’s **The Muppets Studio** since 2006.\n\n![](https://ipfs.decentralized-content.com/ipfs/bafybeicf2f5r3nabecoodiso5baxyzi2gwafqaobj74ju22osfbvl7xxle)\n(*Puppet Heap team on set of Imagine Dragon's 'Radioactive'*)\n\nPuppet Heap loves the project - *I nounspilled them* - and will be joining to design and create the physical puppets of Chip and Benny. And as scale and scope continue to evolve in their journey (we have big plans), they’ll be there, helping to tell their growing story - and all the other Nouns that come into play too.\n![](https://ipfs.decentralized-content.com/ipfs/bafkreigg33zfrairgp6s7pp4ubxeqbub2aflalz744n6ux3czxoiwdhhfu)\n\n# **AWESOME! AND WHAT ABOUT ME?**\n---\n\nMy name is Chris Martin - not of Coldplay, sorry - and I’ve been making independent, global film and television productions for a decade plus now - primarily in Korea.\n\n![](https://ipfs.decentralized-content.com/ipfs/bafkreianc72wofibm66pb6cdpyhrxwkyvydmryhcdiqsc4w3zzycf6nqzi)\n\nMost recently, I co-created, co-wrote, directed, showran,and EP’ed 20 episodes of a show called 'Dramaworld' currently streaming on Amazon that stars well-known actors including Liv Hewson (‘Yellowjackets’, ‘Santa Clarita Diet’), Brett Gray (‘I’m a Virgo’, ‘On My Block’), Daniel Dae Kim (‘Lost’, ‘Hawaii 5-0’), Ha Jiwon (‘Secret Garden’) and K-pop star Henry Lau.\n\n![](https://ipfs.decentralized-content.com/ipfs/bafkreidcjuv6vkzugofvzyvr757lelpmvombyncr3pey7z7kndmjx2cd64)\n\nWith everything I create, I try to lean into **a playful, magical realist tone that’s grounded in heart**, which is the kind of storytelling that I think is not only a perfect fit for Nouns, but also an incredible way to bring people into this journey of Chip and Benny as they go around trying to help.\n\n\n\nI love everything about Nouns - the ethos, the support for creative, weird projects, and did I mention the freakin’ Noggles?! - and have been trying to figure out how I could do something creative that furthered that mission for quite awhile now. \n\nThen suddenly, while wandering around a street festival the other day, I saw this:\n\n![](https://ipfs.decentralized-content.com/ipfs/bafkreibrizjphslww7h46ya3f74alx2xunpxznggmmnd4f2mhmnp6sxmna)\n\n**And bingo! 💡**\n\nThe idea for ‘Noun en Scène’ landed fully formed in my brain! And I knew I had to make it a reality and see what it could eventually become!\n\n# **WHY SHOULD NOUNS FUND THIS?**\n---\n\nStorytelling is everything - always has been. And in a world where we are inundated with ‘content’ online, a playful, quirky and precise project like this will be a breath of fresh air to stand out against the noise.\n\nUtilizing photography as a medium and consistent characters as the subject will allow fans to come back, excited to see where the journey of Chip and Benny will lead and who they'll be trying to 'help' next. \n\nAnd by staging everything down to the last detail, each photographic story that comes out of ‘Noun en Scène’ will simultaneously be a fine art piece, a Sunday (web)comic and continuous character development leading to a broader (and very Noun-curious) audience. \n\n![](https://ipfs.decentralized-content.com/ipfs/bafkreid2an66kifpojvxdzq4pjmnw5ix2cynbqhwemincxiclap2a65i3y)\n\nAnd in the spirit of '**mint everything**,' we are planning to utilize Zora to **mint and document our progress** - design sketches, scripts, behind the scenes, etc. It feels like a great way to document the process of creation and build something creative in public. \n\n# **Speaking of creative, meet Benny!**\nHere's Paul's initial design for Benny:\n\n![](https://ipfs.decentralized-content.com/ipfs/bafybeiad34c4vymsclagkv3jrfzag6hzuzpys5ttuqrpejtekgjjh7j27u)\n\nArms and legs, oh my! With our puppets, we want to keep what makes Nouns distinct while adding a whole new flavor that brings them to life and gives them character. \n\n### **The (mis)adventures of Chip and Benny** \nBy creating empathy and connection with our two little Nouns through **visual storytelling**, the project will help spread Nouns and nounish-ness far and wide - just how Chip and Benny would want it. \n\n![](https://ipfs.decentralized-content.com/ipfs/bafkreib5bcbujje7cllcnu4f7iiwympjh3hdlk6tnctarnv7tmpl52gv4y)\n(*One-shot example sketch - 'Chip and Benny Check for- AHHHHH!'*)\n\nAnd we plan to have this first leg of the project culminate in a **fun droposal** that takes Chip and Benny IRL in eye-catching ways (*see below for a tease*). \n\n# **THE ASK AKA THE BUDGET**\n---\n\nWe want to propose a tight, but realistic budget that still allows us to execute this at the highest professional standards, so that we can first not only prove the concept, but create something that rivals the quality of anything you'd see in a high budget studio release. \n\nWe want to go above and beyond everyone’s expectations for what 'Noun en Scène' can be because seeing is believing and we think this initial batch of scenes will prove the potential of building out characters in a uniquely nounish way and make people want to see where we can go with Chip and Benny in the future. \n\n**BUDGET:**\n* **$40,000 USDC (2 puppets x $20,000 USDC/puppet)** **one-time cost** for the design and fabrication of our ‘Noun Muppets’ - this allows Puppet Heap to design, costume and build out Chip and Benny in their physical ‘muppet’-ish forms (**to be used again and again as the project continues and evolves**).\n* **$50,000 USDC** production budget to shoot and finish 5 'one-shots' - this will be a fully crewed up shoot with actors, set design, hair & makeup etc. and the budget will be used to pay crew, rent equipment, secure locations, finish photos in post etc. (all the production related expenses)\n* **Detailed breakdown** to give a general idea of how the funds will be used **[HERE](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1yym2vm-ojk9sXjrwziRHCDY6VYrSZPva3XBaryZLFUY/edit?usp=sharing)**\n* **1 NOUN post delivery** (*cookie head Noun 483*) - A big reason I want to do this is to become a more active and involved part of the Nouns community so I can more fully participate and build together with other Nouners\n\n**TOTAL BUDGET: $90,000 USDC + 1 NOUN (post delivery)**\n\n# **TIMELINE**\n---\n\nUpon prop passing, we can make our puppets and be in production in approximately **2.5 months** and aiming to have finished images ready **~1 month later**.\n\nAll the while **minting our progress and creative developments** on Zora.\n\n# **FUTURE STEPS**\n---\n\nMy aim for is to use the project to develop the characters and story of these two best friends on their journey to help and do good - even if it always seems to go a little sideways - in a surprising novel and onchain way. 'Noun en Scène' as the first piece will allow us to capture surprising, fun and shareable bitesize stories, which hopefully utimately brings Nouns into the real(ish) world and helps people fall in love with Chip and Benny.\n\nWhich brings me back to the aforementioned droposal! \n\nWhat better way to drum up curiousity than a **droposal** to help take Chip and Benny IRL.

Everyday Ed B faces a new challenge – having to fight off racists at Trader Joes while perusing the vegan aisle, or running butt ass naked for a couple of dollars to pay his rent, OR having to sell photos of himself on the internet to help fund his next record – BUT they never stop him from pushing towards his dream of becoming the Beyoncé of puppets.\n\n## FORMAT\n\n* 10-12 minute web(3)isode\n* Stop motion and mixed media animation.\n\n___\n![](https://imgur.com/aah6X7X.jpg)\n# Pilot Episode\n\n## SYNOPSIS\n\n“A Song About Black Love” - Infatuated by a blossoming love interest, Ed B works out a new song about the joys of Black love. Billy, Ed’s bandmate, roommate and white ally, questions a hidden secret within Ed’s relationship and mayhem ensues.\n\n## FUNDING\n\n“A Song About Black Love” was self funded by Ed Balloon in 2022 primarily through the sale of NFTs. The tentpole fundraising project was the Run Ed Collection, a first-of-its-kind generative sound and motion NFT project that blended stop-motion, 2D and 3D animation, and music. Ed Balloon dropped the 1000 piece collection and it sold out, kickstarting production of the pilot. To help uplift other artists, Ed Balloon pledged 50 percent of the collection’s secondary sales toward The Ed Balloon Generational Wealth Fund, which collects work from Black and other under-represented artists in Web3.\n\n## CAST\n\n**Ed B “The Puppet”** | Ed Balloon\n**Billy** | Seth Green (Robot Chicken, Family Guy)\n**Peggy** | Blair Socci (Comedian)\n**Savannah** | Destiny Lavigne\n___\n# Nouns Integration in New Episodes\n\nThe possibilities for Nouns integration within the Ed B The Puppet universe are infinite. Noggles can be introduced as unique accessories that Ed and Billy can interact with, enabling them to solve problems or embark on new adventures. Noun characters could even make an appearance, bringing a sense of curiosity, wonder, or even magical qualities to the narrative.\n\n___\n![](https://imgur.com/Rw9HCbF.jpg)\n# Project Objective\n\n## Amplify Diversity\n\nBy creating content that celebrates and embraces diversity, we can showcase a wide array of perspectives and experiences. The Ed B ‘The Puppet’ Show will feature characters from different backgrounds, challenging stereotypes and fostering empathy among audiences. Through collaboration with the Nouns, we aim to elevate the visibility of diverse voices and promote a more inclusive entertainment landscape.\n\n## Utilize Satire for Social Commentary\n\nSatire serves as a powerful tool for social commentary, allowing us to address pertinent societal issues in a thought-provoking and engaging manner. By employing satire, we can challenge the status quo, stimulate critical thinking, and spark conversations that lead to positive change. Our collaboration with the Nouns will provide a platform for satirical content that encourages viewers to question and reconsider established norms.\n\n## Promote Collaboration and Solidarity\n\nOur project embraces the spirit of collaboration within the web3 community. By partnering with the Nouns, we aim to showcase the power of collaboration in amplifying diverse voices and driving innovation.

Known for his innovative approach to music making, dynamic production style, and unique blend of electronic, hip-hop, and R&B, his 2022 Run Ed collection was presented as a one-of-a-kind generative sound and motion endeavor that blended stop-motion, 2D and 3D animation, and music. To help uplift other artists, 50 percent of the collection’s secondary sales continued to go toward The Ed Balloon Generational Wealth Fund, which collects work from Black and other under-represented artists in Web3. The pioneering musician also recently self-funded through the sale of NFTs the stop motion animated satire \"A SONG ABOUT BLACK LOVE.”  Executive produced by Daveed Diggs and starring Ed alongside actor Seth Green, the film showcases the difficulties of finding love as a black puppet.  Ed was also recently nominated to nftnow's NFT100, a celebration of the top 100 influential creators and community leaders in the NFT space.\n\nTwitter: @Ed_Balloon\n\n## Daveed Diggs [Executive Producer]\n* Vocalist in experimental hip hop group Clipping.\n* Co-star in The Little Mermaid, Hamilton, Snowpiercer, Wonder, Velvet Buzzsaw\n* Writer and Producer of Blindspotting\n* Tony and Grammy Winner.

We will allocate the funding as follows:\n\n**Production Costs: $675,000**\nCasting and talent fees\nCrew salaries and wages\nProduction design and set construction\nEquipment rental and maintenance\nVisual effects and post-production expenses\n\n**Marketing and Promotion: $100,000**\nAdvertising campaigns\nSocial media marketing\nPublicity and press events\nPromotional materials (posters, trailer, etc.)\nParticipation in industry events and festivals\n\n**Legal: $25,000**\nContract Review\nDigital rights management\n___\n![](https://imgur.com/kkOyLC9.jpg)\n# Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, our proposal to fund two additional shows based on our pilot short film presents an exciting opportunity to amplify diversity and utilize satire to address societal issues. By collaborating with the Nouns, we can showcase the power of diverse voices, challenge established norms, and foster inclusivity in the entertainment industry.","proposer":"0x64B35643C7aC1C0B2DA7975b1DF2D32Fe74Ba217","startBlock":18186215,"endBlock":18222215,"executed":false},"votes":[{"support":0,"voter":"0x008c84421dA5527F462886cEc43D2717B686A7e4","numberOfVotes":9,"reason":"Too much for an initial ask (implied total ask is 4% of the treasury fwiw) and questions about execution and what is Nounish about what we'd be even funding.

In the spirit of positive sum collaboration, we did not want to propose a total amount of PH funding that would be difficult to allocate to builders without diminishing returns. We also received some feedback recommending a reduced time scope to prove out MVP, and have taken this to heart as well. Ultimately, we do think there is room and need for some passionate parallel efforts when it comes to finding and funding good ideas in Season 3 of Nouns.*\n\n## **THE PROBLEM**\n\nNouns historically has used small grants and Prop House rounds to complement onchain proposals. The Small Grants Committee (later known as NSFW) and Prop House rounds had fueled considerable community contributions, propelling the protocol's momentum. But during the latter half of Nouns Season 2, obtaining small grants grew challenging. \n\nWe want to help patch this bug in the protocol, and bring back the Builder-forward Nounish Vibes that brought many of us here in the first place.\n\nWe are a trusted group of contributors in the ecosystem who are willing to collectively take on the challenge of running a dynamic and transparent Small Grants Allocation Pod, as well as coordinating and championing a series of exciting biweekly Prop House Rounds over the next 3 months of Nouns Season 3. \n\n[![s2-noggles.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/W4SHH2bj/s2-noggles.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/SX2dXbMt)\n\n## **THE PLAN**\n\n1. Coordinate with the Prop House team to set up two new \"Season 3 Grants\" Infinite Rounds, where anyone in the ecosystem can apply for retroactive funding up to a maximum of 5 ETH or proactive funding up to a maximum of 1 ETH. (Infinite Rounds are a newer piece of Prop House infra that allows orgs to deploy small grants funding in an organized and transparent way. See [Rug Radio Small Grants example here](https://prop.house/rug-radio-small-grants).) Our team will review grant applications on a rolling week-by-week basis, with a goal to allocate ~17 ETH per month, depending on submission quality.  \n\n2. Coordinate and trial a series of 3 monthly Themed Prop House Rounds with specific focuses such as “Visual Arts”, “Keep Nouns Weird”, “Gaming/Esports”, “CC0 Music”, “Public Goods,” “Media and Content\" (Final themes to be Voted on by the DAO.) We plan to explore various token-voting methods, engaging the wider nounish community in some cases with a strong consideration for maintaining as much sybil protection as possible.\n\n3. Maintain a [Public-facing Discord](https://discord.gg/zY7jpzKwEN) and consistent messaging in the Farcaster Nouns channel, for community members to ask questions and receive feedback on their applications, while also using Prop House’s built-in comment functionality to provide ongoing transparent, public feedback on builder ideas as well.  \n\n4. Publish a public summary of funds deployed for full transparency and accountability.\n\n## **THE PEOPLE**\n\nFor an important program like this, it is essential to have a team that is 1) Known and Trusted, 2) Knowledgeable and Experienced About the Ecosystem and 3) Reliable at Execution.\n\nThe proposing team has all been active and trusted contributors to Nouns for 1+ years minimum, have an intimate knowledge of the Nouniverse, and have all delivered on past projects.\n\n*Core Team Will Include:*\n* [Al409](https://twitter.com/al409eth)\n* [BradQ](https://twitter.com/iambradq)\n* [Benbodhi](https://twitter.com/benbodhi)\n* [ChrisCoCreated](https://twitter.com/ChrisCoCreated)\n* [Joshua Fisher](https://twitter.com/JoshuaFisher)\n* [Maty](https://twitter.com/matyETH/)\n* [Prof Werder](https://twitter.com/ProfWerder)\n* [Sasquatch](https://twitter.com/PartSasquatch)\n* [SuperTightWoody](https://twitter.com/SuperTightWoody/)\n* [Tha Swami](https://twitter.com/tha_swami) and his daughter [Lil Purple Blueberry](https://twitter.com/lilpurpberry)\n* [Toady Hawk](https://twitter.com/toady_hawk)\n\nTeam will only be compensated based on individual participation via Coordinape rounds every month allocated by participating team members and will rotate through responsibilities. Funds will be managed in a 3/6 Multisig. \n\n**All decisions on funding will be made by committee vote with a reasonable quorum and never at any one team member’s sole discretion. We will seek input from Nouners on Discord and Farcaster early and often. If there are not enough good applications via Infinite Rounds to warrant the budgeted ETH, we will be mindful to stretch the funding beyond the 3 month mandate, or will return excess to the DAO. Members of the team will not be eligible for funding from either the Infinite Rounds or the S3G Prop House Rounds.**\n\n\n## **THE PRICE**\n\n- Season 3 Small Grants Infinite Rounds: 50 ETH\n- Trial of 3 Monthly Themed Prop House Rounds: 30 ETH\n- Admin: 25 ETH \n    - (Admin Expense Ratio: 23%)\n\n**Total Program Cost: 105 ETH**\n\n## **THE PAYOFF**\n\nIt has been quite some time since we have seen the Nouns ecosystem buzzing with the energy of artists and creatives, the insights of talented developers and the vibes of passionate proliferators. \n\nWe will put our reputations on the line and bring our considerable skills and dedication to bear to allocate these DAO funds as effectively and transparently as possible to the most passionate and deserving builders, coders and creatives in the Nouniverse. \n\nRecent Prop House campaigns run by BASE and ThankApe have shown that there are still thousands of builders in the ecosystem, who are hungry for opportunities. \n\n**We don’t want Nouns to miss out on capturing that creative energy in Season 3 and want to be a collaborative part of the solution.**\n","proposer":"0x1c1A0F9683bbd453579E74806492F0259805b4f4","startBlock":18186818,"endBlock":18222818,"executed":false},"votes":[{"support":0,"voter":"0x008c84421dA5527F462886cEc43D2717B686A7e4","numberOfVotes":9,"reason":"The people listed are passionate, but overlap too much in too many things and end up in many situations wherein they have to decide whether to vote money and opportunities for people who they work with in other endeavors (Nounish or otherwise) or are otherwise close to.

A proposal that generates more proposals.\n\n\nHave a look at the first iteration of [noundry-gallery.wtf](https://noundry-gallery.wtf/)\n![](https://imgur.com/kIF3iq6.gif)\n\n## **IDEA**\n\n### **BEYOND DISCORD**\n\nThe Noundry channel on Discord is one of the coolest places in the nouniverse, where dozens of artists share Nouns designs and riff off each other. However, it is somewhat niche, and not enough people are aware of it.\n\nTo address that, we want to create a public-facing gallery that will help us attract more artists and community's traits.\n\n### **PROP #348**\n\nThis idea took shape while considering the anniversary [prop #348](https://nouns.wtf/vote/348), when Goldy and team self-organised and stepped forward with some really nice traits. Thanks to them, Nouns had the opportunity to showcase its unique ability to redefine itself through user-generated content.\n\nHowever, the fact that they were the only ones to submit a proposal, despite the vibrant activity in the Noundry channel, highlights the need to make it easier for anyone to submit traits at anytime.\n\nWe took inspiration from [#348](https://nouns.wtf/vote/348) votes with reason and started building to solve this.\n\n**Noun40**:\n*\"1-Invite heads and accessories to be submitted whenever to a public place (have it be known that if your art gets included on the anniversary art update then you'll likely win X eth in retro funding enforced by tradition) \n2-Invite competition for curation through a mandated PH round 1-2 months ahead of anniversary. The mandated round selects the winning curation and includes a meaningful eth prize to incentivize and compensate for the work involved. \n3-The winning curation team submits the art update prop to coincide with the anniversary (given the legitimacy through the mandated PH round, it will likely pass)\"*\n\n**4156**:\n*\"(imho) the last step of removing the training wheels from the noundry should be the death of the convention that artwork only gets updated once per year and 8 traits at a time. It's a competitive advantage of nouns that the artwork is upgradable and the metaphor is open enough to support infinite heads, and we should be maximizing this advantage by engaging with artists, famous or anon, in every country, to make the heads collection as vast and high quality as we can. think of this as the Nouns version of the chain with the most proof of work. This could be especially important post v3. if many instances of Nounsdao have permissionless pools of capital, artists and collectors will be attracted to the instance that accumulates the most cultural capital, and new heads and other traits are an important part of this process\"*\n\n***\n\n## **NOUNDRY GALLERY**\n\n![](https://imgur.com/N21sSlv.jpg)\n*Light mode*\n\n[Noundry-gallery.wtf](https://noundry-gallery.wtf/) lets anyone with a wallet upload their 32x32 transparent pngs for head and accessory traits.Submit your traits, style them using existing NounsDAO assets, and share them with the community.\n\nNo strings attached: you retain all rights to your art until you choose to submit it to the DAO through a candidate proposal. If the proposal is approved, and your artwork is added to the collection, it will become CC0.\n\n*Note: We were reluctant on having glasses due to a potential high impact on the collection, but we might bring them back to satisfy other subDAOs.*\n\n ### **FIRST VERSION**\n\nSo far we've implemented: \n\n* Wallet connect\n* Style your traits with nounsDAO assets and publish them to the homepage and your profile page\n* Favorite traits\n* Sort traits by name, creation date, artists and likes\n* Sort through community members by names, total likes received, sign-up date and total traits submitted\n* Evaluate traits by combining them with nounsDAO assets by hitting the “generate” button on the trait page\n* Edit your profile page and connect your Twitter account\n* Dark/Light mode\n\n![](https://imgur.com/CVAa70L.jpg)\n*\"Generate\" on the trait page to test different combos*\n\n![](https://imgur.com/UxdIrLW.jpg)\n*Community page with sorting mechanisms*\n\n### **NEXT FEATURES**\n\n*  Submit candidate proposal form: in a few clicks, select eligible traits from the site, generate images, encode traits using [Run-length encoding (RLE)](https://nouns.notion.site/Nouns-Protocol-32e4f0bf74fe433e927e2ea35e52a507#6bbc1162af90427bad2dda63a3b31254) and wallet sign a release form to make the trait CC0 if/when integrated with NounsDAO. This will output the transaction copy-pasta and the markdown, giving you all the necessary elements to create a proposal easily (see mockup below). OR/AND\n*  Autosubmit to the candidate proposal endpoint on Nouns.wtf using Nouns SDK and skip the markdown copy-pasta if that is a desirable option\n* Create a commission page where anyone can set up competition for a given trait ( 0.5 ETH for the best “Golf” or “Boat-anchor” trait for ex)\n* Twitter, Farcaster and Discord bots letting us know when new traits are uploaded\n* Integration with [Volky’s Noundry Studio ](https://studio.noundry.wtf/)(Create an “Upload to Gallery” button to directly open the \"Upload Trait\" modal on [noundry-gallery.wtf](https://noundry-gallery.wtf/).)\n* Ability to comment under each traits\n* Enable ENS avatars and usernames\n\n\n![](https://imgur.com/11fHNmc.jpg)\n*\"Submit to DAO\" current mockup: Select trait, write a small description, generate sequential glasses and body color matrice to test combos, define compensation, attach release form, generate transaction with RLE encoding, and save markdown*\n\nWe want to leave room to learn from the community and see what features are desirable.\n\n**Budget: 21 ETH**\n***\n\n## **CURATION**\n\n### **NOUNDRY COMMITTEE**\n\n![](https://imgur.com/SQsJ0Zt.jpg)\n*10 Prop House elected curators NFT mockup*\n\nWhile [Noundry gallery](https://noundry-gallery.wtf/) can also be used for any subDAOs, when it comes to NounsDAO, we believe we should set up a process that guarantees quality and brand alignement. These pixels -along with the smart contract- support the treasury, and we should be considerate about what we choose to integrate with the current collection.\n\nWe suggest implementing a multi-step open process with a Prop House elected committee, akin to what large art institutions would employ, albeit executed on-chain.\n\nWe plan to conduct a Prop House round to elect 10 curators who will have the responsibility of selecting traits over the next 6 months. Each curator will receive a curator NFT and will be able to use their NFT to like traits on the platform.\n\nIf a trait receives likes from 8 curators or more, a 0.1ETH prize will be unlocked, and the trait can then be selected and proposed on-chain using the Submit to DAO page. While curators can post their own traits, they are not allowed to like their own submissions.\n\n**Budget: 10 ETH**\n\n### **ARTISTS REWARDS**\n\nArtists will get 0.1 ETH prizes when they receive more than 8 likes from curators. This budget is intended to attract artists and reach a critical mass, making the platform more appealing. With a 10 ETH budget, we can create 100 prizes. \n\nIf the experiment is successful after 6 months, we can consider repeating the process.\n\n**Budget: 10 ETH**\n\n### **MORE**\n\nIf other DAOs or Nounish projects are interested in using this platform, we could explore implementing workflows to facilitate their participation. Consider, for example, the recent 'Gardeners' concept from Nouns 40; it could be readily sourced from the community.\n\n## **CONCLUSION**\n\n[Noundry-gallery.wtf](https://noundry-gallery.wtf/) wants to help curate the great work and energy coming from the Noundry channel. I hope that in the future we can see many cool Nounish traits emerge from anons, community members, or even renowned artists. \n\nThank you for reading this prop. If approved, we will implement this next set of features in 3 months time and start the curation program in January 2024.\n\n**Total Budget: 41 ETH**\n\nAny questions or comments, feel free to reach out on twitter: [@Coralorca](https://twitter.com/coralorca)\n\n ⌐◨-◨\n\n***\n\n**About me**\nOne of the first nounish builder - started in June 2021 and never looked back.

There is no physical delivery on this support.\n\n## **Concept**\n\nA defining underground force in menswear in the 2010s, Palace here echoes the new and weirdness of Nouns through a series of pieces that will hybridize their creative universes – inherently Italian, boldly new, translated anew. The initial inspiration will be built on the Palace catalog itself and on the undeniable influence of Nouns on nft culture.\n\n## **Introduction**\n\n[Palace Skateboards](https://www.instagram.com/palaceskateboards/) needs little introduction, but for the uninitiated, the London-based skateboarding and clothing brand has become a mainstay in the streetwear scene for incorporating 1990s and pop culture influences with their VHS-style clothing ads. In other words, it’s kitsch, cool, and everything in between.\n\n# **Why Palace?**\n\n[Palace](https://www.instagram.com/palaceskateboards/) began as a brand for skateboarders. It is now a brand for all. Models turn up for castings in Palace. Working class Glasgow dads sport Palace. Jay-Z wears Palace. So does Rihanna. Teenage girls sleep in Palace, dreaming of the heart-throbs they’ve seen wearing Palace online. 2018’s Wimbledon finalists played on court in Palace. Soundcloud rappers adore Palace. The ICA exhibits Palace. Serious DJs with peerless techno collections adorn their record boxes with Palace stickers. Ravers ingest ecstasy pills produced in the shape of Palace’s Tri-Ferg logo. Socio-political causes, including the plights of both Jeremy Corbyn and the people of Palestine, have been smartly memed in versions of the Palace triangle.\n\nA middle-aged architect can slyly intimate he has better kids than his colleagues by picking something up at Palace, even if it’s just their socks. Virgil Abloh and Marc Jacobs wear Palace. London tube station walls are adorned by carriage-length adverts for Palace. The bigwigs at Ralph Lauren were so taken by the irrepressible rise of Palace that Palace became its first ever collaborator in 50 years of singularly myth-making fashion history.\n![](https://imgur.com/dlwqvv6.gif)\n![](https://imgur.com/OEHdbcQ.jpg)\n![](https://imgur.com/KsVOGlC.gif)\nFashion’s favourite photographers Alasdair McLellan, Juergen Teller and David Sims shoot for Palace. Silicon Valley is full of people in Palace. Blue-chip stylists buy Palace from their own pocket money to lend their imagery some of the company’s off-rail styles and indigenous London magic. i-D and British Vogue carry Palace ads. Madonna and child (Rocco) have been photographed proudly wearing Palace. All the while, a fat lad on a Midlands housing estate is looking great and feeling even greater in Palace while waiting for his Chinese takeaway and playing Fortnite.\n\n## Strength in Numbers\n\nThe large take on several already-created collaborations and communication from other brands to the nft audience is an excellent entry point for the brand to reach fans and a new market. Likewise, for the Nouns community;  **significant increases in brand awareness, favorability for further collaborations, and open public interest in the brand, consequently becomes a win-win.** To highlight the ROI of the collaboration, let's look at promoting the Palace brand among your collaborations;\n\n[Gucci](https://www.instagram.com/reel/CjsKDzipOtF), [Mercedes](https://www.instagram.com/tv/CbXyjVPq0VI), [New Balance](https://www.instagram.com/reel/Cr-s3WotGz1), [Adidas](https://www.instagram.com/reel/CoHewHju2Ii), [RIMOWA](https://www.instagram.com/reel/CoUlcMeqvAs), and many others.\n\n![](https://imgur.com/qCpbrcS.jpg)\n[PALACE JAPAN MAGAZINE](https://www.palaceskateboards.com/range/spring-2019/palace-japan-magazine/)\n\n**Approach**: Use public communication-powered resources to compare social media posts containing mentions of the Palace and Nouns brand, before and after the partnership.\n\"Outcome: Insight into the Marketing ROI of an NFT Dive from Palace\" **“ Significantly increases the reach of Nouns by talking to two sets of customers instead of one and gives a signal from one brand that the other brand is trusted by the upscale market.”**\n\n# **Phase One and Phase Two.**\n\n![](https://imgur.com/liP7MrS.jpg)\n\nDetailed legal processes and collaboration building over the next four months; **Phase one**\n\n• Recitals\n• Purpose\n• Confidentiality Clause\n• Commercial Clause\n• Investment Clause\n• Duties and Obligations of Collaborators\n• Reporting and Project Management\n• Intellectual Property Rights\n\n• Fashion product mix;\n• Creation and style;\n• Prototyping;\n• Product development;\n• Marketing and Sales Strategy;\n• Collection management;\n• Evaluation of results.\n\nFor the scope of this proposal, Synthetic team is acting as the liason on behalf of the Nouns community and will adhere to all non-confidentiality & legal agreements relevant to Palace's collaboration workflow. Synthetic will work closely with the Nouns community to share public work-in-progress updates regularly which do not breach the above said agreements.\n\nSynthetic is a mediator, and nouns have a proactive CC0 license, In short Palace would not need Synthetic for commercial construction, what we are doing is raising ideas and presenting about the Nouns ecosystem: the various subgroups, the vibe, and the importance.\n\n![](https://imgur.com/ObE6wW9.jpg)\n![](https://imgur.com/sC8GwqP.jpg)\n\n## Breakdown of legal conditions\n\n**Strategy**: Legal terms and already transcribed collaboration construction.\n\n(the terms below will be robustly written to avoid legal inconvenience)\n\n![](https://imgur.com/fPYHHdj.jpg)\n\n• Recreate the look and feel of the Palace collaborative product; designing new products for that collaboration; concentrated on multiple tacit marketing and management ideas that they share.\n\n• Synthetic and the built committee will be responsible for co-managing the community outreach and communication campaign during construction.\n\n• Creative control, both teams have to work within the decided parameters and cannot go beyond that and after each step, they must report to the other brand.\n\n• Marketing strategies will be created and built exclusively by the Palace team's design and construction team. (This is due to several cordial agreements that the brand already has with the media – Vogue, WWD, Hypebeast and others.)\n\n• Nouns Palace limited edition products will be restricted to online sales.\n\n# **Palace Nouns: What to expect**\n\nThe special line is a connection to the “new” and will feature easter eggs throughout to make each piece truly special. The icing on the cake? Palace will launch women's ready-to-wear designs, making this collaboration one for all genders. The build will be designed to be a capsule of 5 distinct items. Because both aesthetics have been merged, expect logos to do the same.\n\nOn Palace’s classics – we're talking tracksuits, jeans, football shirts, skate decks – you'll see the Nouns identity scattered throughout. You’ll see this synergy on other more luxurious pieces, like a shearling jacket, as well as other unusual collectibles.\n\nAnother surprise for collectors is noggles Palace – a witty homage to the ‘weird’ collection, if you will. The idea came up and its design is about to be created as a double brand, wrapped in the Palace Nouns monogram.\n\n## Palace Nouns: What will be delivered with the execution of phases two and one\n\nEntitled “Palace Nouns,” the capsule – comprises statement-making garments designed for the collaboration. Jackets, noogles palace, vests, and skateboard decks are some of the pieces that are designed to be present, all adorning the new graphics, intertwined with the unmistakable details of Palace and Nouns.\n\nGlobal communication, Palace maintains a standardization of communication between its clients to build and launch a new collaboration; In their coverage, many media outlets go into significant detail about their collaborations and make them public globally.\n\n• Looking ahead: Building a capsule\n\nA capsule collection is essentially a condensed version of a designer's vision/collaboration, often in limited edition, that transcends seasons and trends by being functional. Thus, focusing on building and delivering key looks, without the style and theatricality of a fashion show.\n\n![](https://imgur.com/5qLsHLr.jpg)\n\n**Nouns Palace will be a 5-item capsule.**\n\n**a % (percentage) of collection sales will be directed to the NounsDAO Treasury.**\n\n## Building in public\n\n**There is no precedent for similar proposals in Nouns**, a collaboration like this creates demand for interaction and content that can be used by other builders and future collaborations.\n\nMany of the processes built to reach an agreement with a corporate are extremely tiring and even building their direction and a good presentation, most corporations prioritize closed and legal agreements to add clauses and prioritize their Intellectual Property.\n\n• Create a [general structure](https://mirror.xyz/0x905Ca7a9479EA1B9a8CDeD74da98e3CC5E6E2949) together with lawyer consulting to detail the collaboration and develop material to serve as a reference for other builders.\n\n• Unfortunately, the fashion collaborations have had terrible results in Nouns. What makes this different?\n\nYes, we are aware that we have seen several proposals without any results, this creates a history for the community to reject future approaches in the same segment, but the work we are building is extremely detailed to avoid any interruption or lack of communication. Open and detailed communication framework, creation of the capsule aimed at the general public and construction of an official approach.\n\nBuilding an official approach aims to contain everything that is expected from collaboration and has never been met;\n\n•Campaign\n•Communication published on the Palace's official social media containing a pre-announcement of the launch date.\n•Sending email newsletters to existing customers, with previews of collaboration lookbooks.\n•Mainstream coverage, Palace is known for the buzz it creates when announcing its collaborations, due to the coverage and attention its clients and media outlets create.\n\nCollaboration is the combination of numbers and audience as well as the introduction to a new group of clients. **When we mention that there are no precedents built for Nouns, we reaffirm.**\n\n**Accountability**\n\nForm a Steering Committee: composed of [DeGenData](https://twitter.com/degendata), [Ccarella](https://twitter.com/ccarella), [Oni-apenoun](https://twitter.com/apenoun) and 1 other noun who have intimate knowledge of the brands present in the collaboration.\n\nProvide this committee with **frequent updates on clauses, legal terms, construction and execution of the collaboration.**\n\n[Supriyo](https://twitter.com/next_roy) and [Benbodhi](https://twitter.com/benbodhi) also made themselves available to help us by monitoring the execution of the collaboration framework and giving us closer feedback.\n\n# **What has been done so far?**\n\nWhat has been done so far?\n\nThe Synthetic project is somewhat similar to Nouns, they are both test projects, so the constant change is aimed at future research and long-term construction.\n\nSome of our achievements and experiments during this period;\n\n\n![](https://imgur.com/fYjLkWZ.jpg)\n\n![](https://imgur.com/YbbKqSa.jpg)\n\n![](https://imgur.com/QXeZfjv.jpg)\n\nIn several of our experiments with DAO we had constructions just for the meme without considering the funding request.\n\nA document is being built on the mirror detailing our experiments and will be available on our [Twitter.](https://twitter.com/synthetic_eth)\n\n![](https://imgur.com/aQHXdNh.jpg)\n\n# **FAQ**\n\n• Will there be any activation exclusively for noun holders?\n\nYes, In short - we will be designing the capsule with a variety of nouns specific perks in mind. Details will be defined during the ideation of the capsule.\n\n• Will the capsule be made available globally?\n\nYes, with the exception of one item that will be available exclusively in certain regions.\n\n• Will sales also be available in physical stores?\n\nNouns Palace limited edition products will be restricted to online sales.\n\n• Does this proposal cover actually creating the capsule? So the end result is ultimately Palace x Nouns clothes I can buy online?\n\nThis proposal covers the consolidation of legal terms, as well as the construction of the idealization/concept for creating the capsule. The construction with already defined direction and execution of the capsule will start in phase two (second support).\n\n## Funding Request\n\nOperations & Admin Compensation - €47.000\n\n• Compensation + fees for 4 Months of two full-time synthetic team members. €37.600\n**(€4700 per member/month)**\n\n• Legal expenses - €15400\nLawyer consulting on clauses clauses established by Palace\n\nTotal =\n**€62400**\n\n# **Conclusion**\n    \n• A collaboration is being established between Palace and Nouns.\n\n• The request for this support covers compensation for the next four months of the team and legal processes and the construction of the ideation and detailing of the designer's capsule/collection.\n\n• There is no physical delivery of this support.\n\n• Marketing strategies will be created and built exclusively by the Palace project team.\n\n• The importance of this collaboration for Nouns is absolute, where you have a conversation between two audiences, one of which is global.\n\n• The specific amount of mass production of capsule items is still under study and will be detailed in the second support raised for the second phase.\n\n\n# **Team:**\n\n[Synthetic](https://twitter.com/synthetic_eth): project dedicated to the creation and transmission connections. Through this model, Synthetic has already contributed to five projects for the Nouns.\n\n**Considering the inopportune timing and where much of the attention is being directed towards the fork. This proposal has been restudied and rewritten a few times in the last week with feedback from the community and the committee itself considering the current market.**\n\n**Questions or comments?

We are seeking funding to expand our actions in three complementary strategic directions:\n\n1) New regions 📍\n2) Proper marketing in Brazil 🇧🇷\n3) New product categories 👀\n\n**1) New regions 📍**\n‎ \n![](https://i.imgur.com/4iKllzi.png)\n‎ \nNarcose is already part of a network of regular collaborative breweries, through which it markets its beers in the US and Europe. We will take Public Good Beer to these markets, also integrating them into our onboarding ecosystem and turning them into real Nouns builders.\n\nWe are asking for 4350 USDC for label printing, marketing material, initial beer production (minimum 1500 cans/bottles), and aftermovies/content production FOR EACH of our partners:\n\n**Canil** (Portugal) 🇵🇹 - already committed to 1500 bottles and will launch in October, ahead of various crypto events such as ZKdevsummit, Dune Con, ETH Lisbon, EBS2023, Nearcon and Web Summit, all happening in November.\n\n**Stillwater Brewery** (Seattle) 🇺🇸\n**Against the Grain** (Kentucky) 🇺🇸\n**Wooden Ship** (Minneapolis) 🇺🇸\n**Brewski** (Sweden) 🇸🇪\n**Bierol** (Austria) 🇦🇹\n\nIf breweries exclusively produce the subsidized batch, Nouns' maximum cost per can or bottle, which includes premium beer, label printing, a launch event, and ongoing marketing and sales throughout the batch, is only 2.90 USD. Should the brewery opt for a larger batch, as is the case in Brazil, or produce a second batch independently, this cost significantly decreases.\n\nAdditionally, the impact of the funding goes beyond a single event. It serves as a **catalyst for wider influence and regular integration of Nouns into everyday culture.** This is evident in the growing number of [reviews](https://untappd.com/b/cervejaria-narcose-public-good-ipa/5389905) on the popular Untappd app (over 70 to date), spontaneous shares on social media, adoption by various Gnars-related activities in Brazil, featuring in the Nounish Punk game, and our successful production management in Portugal.\n\n👉 **Accelerating Public Good Beer expansion not only brings legitimacy but also sustains a lasting cultural impact for Nouns.**\n\n**BUDGET: 6x 4350 = 26100 USDC**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/jvG8dTb.png)\n‎ \n**2) Proper marketing in Brazil 🇧🇷**\n‎ \nInternational expansion will not be instantaneous, as it demands a free schedule in the industry. In this period, we take advantage of the remaining inventory of over 3000 cans produced. \n\nDespite the success of Phase 1, we believe we haven’t reached the full IRL proliferation potential for such a pioneer project. We had 0.5 ETH for everything (sub-300 cans and a very short-scale marketing activation). Thus, the proposed expansion would bring the deserved impact and tons of resources for further promotion of the Nouniverse.\n\nWe are requesting 4350 USDC per quarter for the next six months to fund the activities below. We commit to at least one IRL event every quarter, but given the rapid growth of the Nouns community in Brazil, we anticipate numerous opportunities to engage with new fans.\n\n- Public Good Beer distribution\n- Marketing materials (shirts, stickers, temporary tattoos, and more)\n- Brand activations\n- Professional media production\n\n**BUDGET: 2x 4350 = 8700 USDC**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/5JpkcCz.gif)\n‎\n**3) New product categories 👀**\n‎ \nBeyond beer, we have the opportunity to extend the portfolio to two synergic brands/categories:\n\na) BBQ sauces - for the weekly beer-fueled barbecues we do in Brazil; and\nb) Sunscreen - for our community along 7637 km of coastline, with bikinis, surf stars, and sunglasses ⌐◨-◨ \n\nWe would like to allocate a total budget of 5000 USDC for working on this as the project progresses. Alongside this, we also have the coordination and maintenance of the activities during the period of six months at a cost of 6000 USDC.\n\n**BUDGET: 11000 USDC**\n‎ \n## Roadmap\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/S9KqgmZ.png)\n‎ \n## Team\n\nfabioseva.eth\njp.⌐◨-◨ \n\nWe are very excited to keep spreading the cc0 culture and bringing companies on board with us.

Team includes 1 BD lead, COO, 2 more devs, and a designer. Development began in Q3 2021. Before going full-time web3, DigitalOil was an iOS developer, satcom engineer, and logistics business executive. He was behind [Prop 199](https://nouns.wtf/vote/199) and worked on [Private Voting](https://prop.house/nouns/private-voting-research-sprint/3976) (recently won the Nouns Private Voting contest) Research funded by Nouns. DigitalOil also recently founded [The Panama DAO](https://twitter.com/ThePanamaDAO), in the image of Nouns DAO, which was pre-seeded 1 ETH by [Nouns Prop House](https://prop.house/nouns/open-round:-12/2166) and subsequently seeded 20 ETH by a [Builder DAO Incubator round](https://prop.house/builder/dao-incubator-round-2).\n\nFor more on DigitalOil’s thoughts about Nouns, please refer to his Nouns Agora statement.\n\nNote that DigitalOil has fronted all NFTR founding expenses (over $400k worth) since inception, ~19 months ago. NFTR has never raised seed funding.\n\n# What is NFTR?\n\nNFTR (NFT Registry) is a universal, permissionless NFT Naming Registry on Ethereum.\n\nNFTR allows naming any ERC721 with a globally unique name across all NFTs.\n\nIt's comparable (albeit different architecturally) to ENS for naming NFTs instead of wallets.\n \nNaming an NFT grants the NFT a NFTR Profile with soon to be integrated ERC-6551 functionality (a new standard for Token Bound Accounts) and extensive utility. \n\nNFTR provides an API so that any platform can pull and display names alongside NFTs.\n\nFor more details on protocol architecture, visit [NFTR.name](https://nftr.name) to view our [Docs](https://docs.nftr.name), try our live dApp, view NFTR Profiles at [name].NFTR.name, or engage on our [Discord](https://discord.gg/frMSHsAvay).\n\n![*Nouns that have been named on NFTR.

We’d be honored to enlist your support and advocacy, both as a Nouns brand and as a collection of highly sensible and web3 native individuals. \n\n# ERC-6551 Integration + Enhancement\n\nFrom ERC-6551's [whitepaper](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-6551#abstract):\n\nERC-6551 Abstract: “This proposal defines a system which assigns Ethereum accounts to all non-fungible tokens. These token bound accounts allow NFTs to own assets and interact with applications, without requiring changes to existing smart contracts or infrastructure.”\n\nAnother quote: \"Each token bound account is owned by a single ERC-721 token, allowing the token to interact with the blockchain, record transaction history, and own on-chain assets. Control of each token bound account is delegated to the owner of the ERC-721 token, allowing the owner to initiate on-chain actions on behalf of their token.\"\n\nIf ERC-721s (NFTs) are to be so active, they must be simply and uniquely identifiable.\n\nENS, fundamentally, provides this service to Ethereum wallets.\n\nNFTR, natively, provides this service to NFTs and ERC-6551 Users.\n\nAs ENS provides limitless value and utility beyond reach/reference, so does NFTR. \n\n# NFT Name Integration\n\nNFTR Names can be easily integrated by ABI/API call into:\n* Existing NFT Marketplaces (show names below NFTs for sale)\n* Metaverse spaces\n* Web3 Games\n* Social media apps that display verified NFTs\n\nIntegrated NFTR Names are:\n\n* Quickly reachable by web domain at [name].nftr.name\n* Clickable, directing to NFTR Profile for direct interaction with the NFT\n* Interactive via NFT Messaging, direct payments, bidding, browsing NFT history, etc.\n\n# How Does NFTR’s namespace work?\n\nNFT Names are registered in NFTR’s [Registry Contract](https://etherscan.io/address/0xc662a8ce36392d4b9489d0b59605a1874711bfc6). They are unique, meaning that no two NFTs can simultaneously hold the same name. They are NOT tokens or NFTs themselves. This brings the following benefits:\n* NFTR Name transactions are light (not gas intensive)\n* NFT Names are bound to the NFT, and travel with the NFT\nNFTR’s native name marketplace facilitates free in-wallet name transfer and buying/selling/bidding between wallets. Names are integrated into existing dApps via API/ABI call.\n\nNames are alphanumeric strings with no leading or trailing spaces, and are case sensitive for display purposes. But case-insensitive for duplicity purposes.\n\n\n# Similar Props\n\n**107 Verse**: Narrowly passed before funds were returned. Conflicted results due to purchase of equity in a non-Nouns project (Verse). Relation to our prop: NFTR is requesting DAO funds, not selling equity. NFTR is Nounish in DAO structure, and will feature ⌐◧-◧ in daily NFTs. \n\n**189 SharkDAO**: “I see these types of proposals as \"cultural venture investments\", similar to our @nounsbuilder funding… we just need to know whether a) we trust that the subDAO will steward those funds in a way that is positive for Nouns DAO, and b) if the cumulative ask is an amount of our treasury we are comfortable \"locking up\" until we see the cultural ROI from that spending.” Relation to our prop: NFTR can be viewed as a venture investment, though all funds will be incrementally added to the NFTR DAO, and their usage will be determined by DAO members (20% NFTR team, 10% NounsDAO). As a contributing member of Nouns and an innovator in the space, it can be reasonably assumed that DigitalOil will be an admirable steward of NFTR and its association to the Nouns brand and DAO model. \n\n**284: PizzaDAO**: Executed prop to fund PizzaDAO’s global pizza party, featuring Nouns branding and Noggle props. Here, Nouns served as sponsor for another DAO’s mission while perpetuating the Nouns meme. Relation to our prop: Not only will Nouns’ branding be integrated into NFTR’s NFTs and platform; NFTR’s DAO structure will inherently mimic the ideal web3 standard established by NounsDAO, eternally perpetuating the meme and the model. \n\n# NFTR Revenue Model\n\nMultiple revenue streams that will flow to the NFTR DAO Treasury.\n* Paid Namings (0.01 ETH, one-time lifetime fee, adjustable by the DAO)\n* NFTR Marketplace Revenue (5% fee of name trade value, adjustable by the DAO)\n* Daily Nounish NFT Mints\n* Golden Ticket sale fees ([GTKs are an existing](https://www.nftr.name/#/golden-ticket) NFTR-created ERC-20 that token-gates NFTR’s top 1000 names)\n* Fees from eventual advanced NFTR features (NFT Groups, subdomains, etc.)\n\n# How NFTR will proliferate Nouns\n\n* Finish building a web3 standard in the model of Nouns DAO\n* Nounish governance NFTs\n* Nouns DAO will become a major contributor to the NFTR DAO\n* Nouns DAO maintains a significant influence (10% voting weight) over NFTR DAO props.

Artwork was created by [Facu](https://twitter.com/facuserif)._\n\n---\n\n## Context\n\nEarly in Nouns' history, PH open rounds served an important role within the Nouns ecosystem. It was a place where new builders could receive a few ETH for their early to mid stage ideas with less governance overhead. It was also a way for the DAO to create open competition around a not-too-big commitment of ETH spending, and allow the DAO to harvest the long-tail of ideas rather than being limited to what makes it onchain.\n\nHowever, over the rounds, voter attention waned and PH open rounds started to show its governance weakness. Unlike onchain props where every large voter ultimately paid attention to every prop and voted when necessary, PH open rounds started to go largely unattended. What's worse, rounds increasingly ran the risk of being arbitrarily determined by whichever large voter decided to engage in a given round.\n\nAs a result, the PH open rounds lost much of its legitimacy and we were unable to continue funding through it. Towards the end, we were running 2.5 ETH single-winner rounds every other week, funding a grand total of 5 ETH(!) per month through PH. The last round's outcome—[Open Round 21](https://prop.house/nouns/open-round-21)—was determined by a single large voter as the sole voter of the winning prop.\n\n---\n\n## Proposal\n\nLet's kickstart the PH open rounds again branding them as the \"Nouns Garden\" (to make them more fun and memeable) and run a mandated PH round to elect 24 \"Gardeners\" to vote on the DAO's behalf in these rounds.\n\nRepresentative voting should allow for a more attentive class of voters to vote on each open round while the election ensures that the DAO voters still indirectly maintain influence over the outcomes of PH open rounds. \n\n## More details:\n\n**The Art:**\nThe gardener art work was completed by [Facu](https://twitter.com/facuserif) and funded using PH team's funds.\n\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BJyrigaCn.png)\n\n\n**Minting & Distribution:**\nThis proposal mints 24 Nouns Gardener NFTs initially going to the [garden-admin multisig](https://etherscan.io/address/0xD94F65a9BFa4Fcb04FFbc0A64687667FcB28110e) managed by Noun 40 and seneca. If this prop goes through, the PH team will run the Gardener election mandate round. The winners will then be sent the Gardener NFTs which will serve as the voting token in the Nouns Garden rounds. \n\n\n**Gardener Selection:**\nThe Gardener position should be open to nouners and non-nouners alike and everyone that's interested in having fun doing civic service for the dao is welcome to run for the position!\n\nIt's desirable that the PH layer doesn't end up with an entirely disjoint set of voters from the onchain prop voters. Ideally, there's a lot of overlap and as a result the props that win funding at the PH layer will have a good chance of success receiving continued funding onchain if they continue to execute well.\n\nThe Gardener position will be re-elected at a 3 month cadence. 6 months or a year feels like forever in Nouns time. 2 months feels too frequent.\n\n**Gardener Compensation:**\nThe Gardener position will be volunteer roles without specific compensation (outside of the NFTs!)\n\nThere's a notion that delegate positions should be paid b/c reading props and voting is \"work\". However, not all civic service positions are better performed when paid, and there's also definitely fun and prestige in serving as a PH delegate of the DAO. This proposal intends to explore the potential of representative voting at the PH layer without adding financial incentives into the mix.\n\n**Gardener Voting Power:**\nEach Gardener will have the equal voting power (10 votes to spread across props in each round). If we start to observe bad behavior amongst Gardenders such as collusion or self-dealing, then we could institute quadratic voting where the cost of voting for the same prop multiple times goes up linearly such that it is harder to effectuate collusion or self-dealing. We're proposing to start with the simple voting scheme so that we don't unnecessarily introduce complexity.\n\n**Gardener Count:**\n24 was chosen as a size that is materially larger than committee sizes we explored in the past with NSFW (4-10) and DCS pod (5), as to assuage the concern (or perception) that a few people can be influenced to sway outcomes, while also ensuring that the Gardener election is likely to be competitive. It is not hard to imagine that we can elect two dozen worthy candidates. It is not clear that we could elect fifty. \n\n**Garden Rounds:**\nNouns Garden rounds will start off as 5 ETH x 2 winners (10 ETH) rounds every other week. \n\nTwo 10 ETH rounds a month still amounts to a very small percentage of our overall funding allocated through PH open rounds. We spent around ~900 ETH per month the past year, so 20 ETH would be ~2% of our spending rate. Ideally, the open-ended, lower friction, competitive, mid-tail funding the PH open rounds promise can scale further to be 10-20% of our spending, but we likely shouldn't start where we want to end up. We should scale up as builders return to PH and rounds remain competitive even as more funding goes through.\n\nOnce the PH protocol is launched, the DAO could vote on these parameters concretely. For now, we have to trust the PH team to execute these rounds.\n\n**Garden Funding:**\nNouns DAO has granted the Prop House team a total of 550 ETH over the last 2 years to direct towards Nouns DAO related rounds of which 160 ETH remain. These funds will be used towards the first quarter of Nouns Garden (60 ETH).\n\n**Miscellaneous:**\nIf the Nouns Garden is successful and continues after the first quarter, each quarter we will mint new Gardener NFTs such that Gardeners can continue to own their old NFTs as an object that holds provenance of their service. We would not expect Gardeners to transfer or sell their NFTs to someone else before the quarter is over given their reputation is at stake.","proposer":"0xaE65E700f3f8904ac1007d47a5309dD26f8146c0","startBlock":18217796,"endBlock":18253796,"executed":true},"votes":[{"support":0,"voter":"0x67DaCc258DCCc8CbFB493c652ab5170C3CFf0AD9","numberOfVotes":2,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0xA86882277E69FbF0a51805cdc8b0a3a113079E63","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":"Excited for this -- hopefully its the nouns-native funding body of smaller eth ranges we've always wanted but struggled to find the correct model for."},{"support":1,"voter":"0x0658f4eD17289144717713ADfFC2539eF7c2EF8e","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x3B60e31CFC48a9074CD5bEbb26C9EAa77650a43F","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":"Love this experiment to see if we can make PropHouse even more valuable, through a focused (and playful) grants committee.

The experience and knowledge gained over 16 months of operation has prepared us to further leverage the hypercycle generated by our Goodwill, Network, Advocacy, Releases, and Serendipity. Let's integrate Nouns into our subcultures, and bring a million shredders onchain!\n\n📝 *Skateboarding remains our primary illustrative example. Our commitment spans all subcultures we're part of and the term \"shredder\" describes anyone contributing to them.*\n\n## 📌 TLDR\n\n![](https://ipfs.decentralized-content.com/ipfs/bafybeihfnygx5opj7lq5o4yv4eyo3yuqlqerbppilwc3rzdynfmo2ayrdu)\n\n**Requesting 300,000 USDC**\n\n- A treasury for continuous public terrain park enhancements\n- Fund Shredders that represent gnars as community leaders and ambassadors\n- Operational funds for rewarding our most notable contributors\n- Intuitive onboarding with commemorative QR/NFC plaques\n- Enhance Nouns' outreach with subculture expertise\n\n*ie. Funding the revitalisation of public spaces for shredders of all disciplines to express themselves freely while proliferating Nouns ⌐◨-◨*\n\n## 🛹 Background/Problem Statement\n\n![](https://ipfs.decentralized-content.com/ipfs/bafybeiam6uer545pvjsbzbtnw5uy77mr3t3wus7iazve42yv4h7ezvsjeu)\n\n📝 *Cult classic > Corporate cringe. Movements > Marketing.*\n\nSkateboarding and similar subcultures, despite their rise in popularity, grapple with commercial overreach and value retention. Some of the most pressing challenges include:\n\n1. **Commercial Exploitation**: Outside brands jumping into skateboarding often prioritise profit over authenticity.\n2. **Loss of Authenticity**: Many skaters, due to financial pressures, might promote brands they don't genuinely align with.\n3. **Skater Exploitation**: Many skaters, despite their talent, don't receive fair compensation, especially considering the sport's physical demands.\n4. **Mainstream Misrepresentation**: Media portrayals frequently miss the genuine essence of skateboarding, leaning into stereotypes.\n5. **Skatepark Commercialisation**: Once-communal skateparks are becoming increasingly commercialised.\n6. **Core Values vs. Growth**: Balancing foundational skateboarding values with growth opportunities remains a delicate act.\n\nThe skateboarding domain needs a thoughtful equilibrium. Brands that genuinely get and respect the skate culture have the potential to collaboratively benefit both parties without diluting the sport's spirit.\n\n## 💡 Proposed Solution\n\n![](https://ipfs.decentralized-content.com/ipfs/bafkreiflj5bgctvmzjujul3kvehilbgrzcag7zhomomfdtrtbit4sptjym)\n\n📝 *Check out the [Meier Skatepark renovation](https://www.gnars.wtf/dao/proposals/3) proposal that's currently being delivered*\n\n**GNARS** as an acronym crystallises our ethos, mirroring the Nouns' virtuous cycle, acting as our serendipity engine:\n\n- **Goodwill**: Renewing skateparks and introducing new, shred-worthy sculptures\n- **Network**: Culturally sensitive contributions earn us both visibility and respect\n- **Advocacy**: Harmonising with communities helps us draw in new enthusiasts\n- **Releases**: Collective creative outputs with shared proceeds bolster funding\n- **Serendipity**: Getting onchain empowers shredders, opening fresh avenues\n\nEmpowering individuals to step into the blockchain world is central to our mission. Shredders, akin to artists, can undergo transformative experiences through this. Our overarching goal is to amplify our influence, simplify operational processes, and champion those with genuine grassroots credibility.\n\n## 🌟 Opportunity\n\n![](https://ipfs.decentralized-content.com/ipfs/bafkreihhjrjim3rtjd6k2drh6r5gpy5i7xfp22gjcuouujecd2p4arkxhq)\n\n📝 *We're not just another brand. We're a movement. Head-less so you can shred more!*\n\nThe Nouns ecosystem, with its unique blend of art, technology, and community, offers a fertile ground for genuine subcultural integration. Our approach is not about plastering logos everywhere but about creating genuine value and experiences.\n\n1. **Skatepark Enhancements**: We're not just slapping stickers. We're improving DIY spots and skateparks, making them better for everyone.\n2. **Nouns-Themed Sculptures**: Introducing Nouns-themed obstacles and sculptures in skateparks worldwide.\n3. **QR/NFC Plaques**: Simplifying onboarding with intuitive QR/NFC plaques at skateparks.\n4. **Subculture Expertise**: Leveraging our deep-rooted expertise to enhance Nouns' outreach in various subcultures, such as skating, rollerblading, surfing, bodyboarding, flying and other extreme sports.\n5. **Grassroots approach**: Empowering Gnars Shredders to engage their local community and organise meetups, beach cleanups and other forms of experiences that cause positive impact on their daily lives.\n\nOur target of onboarding a million shredders might seem lofty, but it’s just a fraction - 0.2% - of the 490 million participants in extreme sports.\n\nTo provide some perspective, skateboarding alone boasts 85 million participants. Industries like adventure tourism further validate our optimistic projections, given their sustained growth trajectories.\n\n## 📊 Budget Breakdown\n\nPer the TLDR, our ask is **300,000 USDC** to our treasury (DAO executor) at `gnars.eth`. We aim to replicate our success across multiple locations that arise through grassroots discovery and Prop House infinite rounds funding. \n\nBased on previous project expenses, we estimate 24 additional projects is an achievable outcome over the next 12 months, especially when focused on emerging markets where every gwei goes such a long way:\n\n- **Continuous park enhancements - 240,000 USDC**\n    - Skatepark refurbishments: 140,000 USDC\n    - Nouns-themed sculptures: 50,000 USDC\n    - Supporting Ambassadors/Shredders: 30,000 USDC\n    - QR/NFC plaques for onboarding: 10,000 USDC\n    - Miscellaneous & unforeseen expenses: 10,000 USDC\n- **Administration of funded projects - 60,000 USDC**\n    - Coordinate community-driven outreach and promo\n    - Discord moderation and general administrative tasks\n    - Onboarding support for grant recipients and builders \n    - Curation and support for new That's Gnarly creators\n- **Onchain (gas) and other expenses - Self-funded**\n    - Codebase maintenance, improvements and bug squashing\n    - Implement auction settlement leaderboard to reward settlooors\n    - Provide regular \"[Propdates](https://propdates-app.vercel.app/)\" to keep Nouns updated onchain\n    - Releasing collective productions atop zora protocol rewards\n    - Deploy open source portfolio at gnars.com ([GitHub Pages](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/github-pages/))\n\n📝 *Through onchain governance, we will allocate funds as earmarked. Finer details are laid out later in this proposal. If you've any questions, please don't hesitate to [join our Discord](https://discord.gg/gnars) for a discussion. We are here to help!*\n\n## 🗳️ Funds Allocation & Voting\n\nThe funds will arrive at `gnars.eth` which is our onchain treasury and DAO executor contract. It functions exactly as the Nouns DAO treasury does. Decisions are made through the usual voting process by [Gnars holders](https://etherscan.io/token/0x558BFFF0D583416f7C4e380625c7865821b8E95C#balances).\n\n![](https://ipfs.decentralized-content.com/ipfs/bafybeifw3mcxausdmec7lkjd7dnpcwj6dxsfremcdweuil5nqr2oidixau)\n\nAt present, there are 3980 Gnars in circulation across 696 holders. We'd like to bring attention to the 8 largest holders as shown in the above screenshot, as they're very influential within the DAO, and have our best interests at heart:\n\n1. **[Non-voting](https://app.safe.global/settings/setup?safe=eth:0x0658f4eD17289144717713ADfFC2539eF7c2EF8e):** Instead of a founders' reward, 10% of Gnars are directed to the `shred.gnars.eth (0x06...EF8e)` multisig for onboarding shredders who are new to web3 and wish to participate in governance. Gami, who initiated the Gnars project, is instead rewarded in ETH as chosen by each bidder when placing bids in our auctions, using the bid slider. By default it's set at 90% treasury (`gnars.eth`) and 10% founder (`gami.eth`).\n2. **[Gami](https://twitter.com/0xigami):** Hyperactive Nouns contributor, founder of Gnars, [Art Haus](https://art.haus), [Omega](https://omega.build), and author of [The Hypercommons](https://hypercommons.wtf/): A Manifesto for a Positive-Sum World. Visit his personal website at [gami.wtf](https://gami.wtf) for more information.\n3. **[Ric Burton](https://twitter.com/ricburton):** Early contributor to the Ethereum ecosystem and talented kitesurfer/kiteboarder. Has shown huge support to Gnars and has even been known to offer Gnars holders access to his beachfront property.\n4. **[Benbodhi](https://twitter.com/benbodhi):** Perhaps the first person to arrive in the Gnars discord server and cofounder of [Alps DAO](https://alps.wtf). Showing early support as a collector, he's been an avid community moderator and wearer of many hats. Nounish AF.\n5. **[Satori:](https://twitter.com/0xsatori)** Also an early collector and contributor across all facets of the project. He has since become a valuable asset within various Nouns related teams and is the author of our [Gnarly News](https://gnarly.news) newsletter.\n6. **[Geffenz:](https://twitter.com/geffenz)** One of the most active auction participants, known more recently for the creation of [Gnarsauce](https://thatsgnar.ly/shop/gnarssauce), settling more auctions than any other, and for creating our \"Be Kind & Settle\" meme that led to [settle.wtf](https://settle.wtf) being deployed.\n7. **[DjjD:](https://twitter.com/TheDjjDAbides)** long time collector of Gnars having spent many hours in our Auctions discord channel along with Geffenz and other settlooors. He's a curator for [Redlion](https://twitter.com/redlion) and has been supporting us since our humble beginnings.\n8. **[Blockbird](https://twitter.com/_blockbird):** prominent [Art Blocks collector](https://gallery.so/blockbird), photographer and world traveller, who 50/50 owns Noun 189 with Gami and was also responsible for the inception of Gnars over coffee at a cafe in Sydney, January 2022.\n \n[The multisig](https://app.safe.global/settings/setup?safe=eth:0x0658f4eD17289144717713ADfFC2539eF7c2EF8e) mentioned at the top of this list at `shred.gnars.eth` was the original Gnars treasury, prior to our migration to a fully onchain nounish DAO in June this year. As well as receiving Gnars for shredder onboarding, it's used for proposal submissions such as this one, and the signers are as follows:\n\n- [Gami (0x38...fffd)](https://etherscan.io/address/0x387a161C6b25aA854100aBaED39274e51aaffffd)\n- [Benbodhi (0x80...87f6)](https://etherscan.io/address/0x80826180A2629206E3499B5167aaC8440E3F87f6)\n- [Blockbird (0x6B...4DDD)](https://etherscan.io/address/0x6B67623ff56c10d9dcFc2152425f90285fC74DDD)\n- [Davin (0xdf...d939)](https://etherscan.io/address/0xdfB6ed808fADddAd9154F5605E349fFF96E3d939)\n- [Vlad (0x41...be4A)](https://etherscan.io/address/0x41CB654D1F47913ACAB158a8199191D160DAbe4A)\n- [Oni (0x91...2937)](https://etherscan.io/address/0x91dCCAA260CC4616E1a6e6b693DB7207C5E42937)\n- [22 (agreed to be removed)](https://etherscan.io/address/0x75Ee6eb3d8DAcf41eE2e5307090B197D3E1Cca6E)\n\nSince no Gnars are distributed as founder rewards, all holders purchased all their Gnars themselves including Gami. who owns Noun 189, offering Gnars community the opportunity for delegation.\n\n## 🧭 Approach and Strategy\n\n[![](https://ipfs.decentralized-content.com/ipfs/bafybeifkzcdwnvktxhmf47i67iel4gqyqtqc6jkhqc2xfxxqnfnmjr5dja)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3unXaYpMl8)\n\n📝 *Watch this NounGnarversary celebration funded via Prop House [on YouTube ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3unXaYpMl8)*\n\nOur strategy is multi-pronged, ensuring we address both immediate needs and long-term sustainability:\n\n- **Skatepark Enhancement Projects**\nWe've already showcased our impact: \n    - Opstacle (noggle rail) installations such as [the original](https://snapshot.org/#/gnars.eth/proposal/0xb63306dbfe950dd9754d5edcf8f48c6ff9bdd32eeeff4c644cb90c974a3055fa) in [Praça XV, Rio de Janeiro](https://twitter.com/vladhzc/status/1660451083427143681) (Brazil), and others in [Nairobi](https://twitter.com/davinoyesigye/status/1688473570119131136) (Kenya), [Domingo de Guzmán](https://twitter.com/PagesAndres/status/1632145699256016900) (Dominican Republic), and [Chicago](https://twitter.com/webgnar/status/1703201471255187565) (United States) with more to come\n    - Skatepark refurbishments such as [Skate Park Maracanã](https://snapshot.org/#/gnars.eth/proposal/0xb6f1781ada377924f11500e81735dd60170984c7976a1267027b3bd67fca93f1) (Rio de Janeiro), [Gigoia Island Skatepark](https://nouns.wtf/vote/142) (Rio de Janeiro) and [Meier Skatepark](https://www.gnars.wtf/dao/proposals/3) (Rio de Janeiro) are great examples of our contributions and collaborations\n    - Nouniversary events in [Pereira](https://thatsgnar.ly/thatsgnarly/stories/femboard-x-gnars) (Colombia), [Niterói](https://thatsgnar.ly/thatsgnarly/stories/noun-gnar-versary) (Brazil), [São Paulo](https://thatsgnar.ly/thatsgnarly/stories/uncharted-waves) (Brazil), [Nairobi](https://thatsgnar.ly/thatsgnarly/stories/noungnarversary-celebration-nairobi) (Kenya) demonstrate our commitment to Nouns \n- **Operational Funds for Notable Contributors**: Recognising and compensating our most notable contributors for their relentless efforts, unearthing grassroots opportunities around the globe, and keeping thing running smoothly\n- **Continuous Park Enhancements**: Establishing a treasury for ongoing terrain park improvements, ensuring sustained impact and cultural relevance, all incredible catalysts for ongoing content production\n- **Intuitive Onboarding**: Implementing QR/NFC plaques for commemorative purposes and seamless onboarding of new members to our ecosystem\n- **Brand Outreach**: Collaborating with authentic brands and influencers in the action sports domain to amplify reach and earn the respect of our peers\n\nOur dual focus on the action sports community and local councils ensures that our initiatives resonate with authentic cultural value. We reject the zero-sum and seek out win-win, positive-sum outcomes for all involved.\n\n## 🚧 Project Discovery & Selection\n\nWhile we have showcased our past skatepark refurbishments, the future projects are yet to be determined. Gnars original focus was on sponsoring individual athletes, but we've learned that empowering them to uplift their entire community is far more impactful. We wanna help create local heroes!\n\n![](https://ipfs.decentralized-content.com/ipfs/bafybeigfvokrjnehnlajktaca4wnarcd322gb2srdgy6flfhx6izmxbfse)\n\n📝 *Explore our Nouniversary events with the new Stories feature on [That's Gnarly](https://thatsgnar.ly/stories)*\n\nSkatepark refurbishments and opstacle (giant noggle rail) installations have proven to be the gifts that keep on giving. Beyond our initial unveilings and launch celebrations, our creations are often seen across social media. As shredders become intrigued by our artistic installations, they are often inspired to capture and post tricks they perform on them.\n\n![](https://ipfs.decentralized-content.com/ipfs/bafybeigfm66vmoqnarkg2fvgpyswwnio7wjupewbxqr3hytmk72tfbkkvi)\n\n📝 *One of many ways to see our creations surfacing on Instagram is [#gnars](https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/gnars/top/)*\n\nThe selection process for which projects we pursue involves grassroots discovery by DAO members who are passionate about uplifting their communities.

We've been running an infinite round that funds artists to complete their designs that end up on skateboards ridden by Tom Rohrer in [his tutorial videos](https://www.instagram.com/toms_tutorials/). Once the protocol hits mainnet, we intend on being power users and believe Prop House is one of the most powerful tools available to communities like ours.\n\n## 🫂 Notable Contributions\n\n![](https://ipfs.decentralized-content.com/ipfs/bafybeihr7uy7fgb2pz6inhpphj4kknd2aggrzszfg3an4plyoyb2vs2mfe)\n\n📝 *Visit [roko.dev](https://roko.dev/) to see our sustained growth of unique contributing users!*\n\nWe have a dedicated group of contributors who've naturally landed to fill certain needs.

But, Nouns being cc0, we're uniquely capable of leaning into the potential of having multiple funding bodies, each with different approaches but individually highly aligned.\n\n**Isn't a lower threshold just making it easier for arbitrageurs?**\nIt is widely understood that we need to accelerate spending to close the arbitrage opportunity. Yet, figuring out exactly how to *thoughtfully* accelerate spending is a process that takes time. In the meantime, it seems like we'll be co-existing with arbers and should make the most out of the situation. Lowering the threshold increases arber competition, accelerating the process, decreasing their profits, and allowing them to drain less of the treasury.\n\n**Doesn't inviting arbitrageurs disrupt governance?**\nA lower threshold doesn't change that arbers will vote No on proposals and attempt to block spending. Conversely, it makes it less likely that arbers grow into a big cohort with significant voting power, which is a side effect of accumulating to reach the fork threshold.\n\n**Why not raise the threshold instead?**\nWhile raising the threshold might seem like a good stopgap to defend the dao against further arbitrage, it comes with an air of intellectual dishonesty and risks being [regressive](https://warpcast.com/vapeape/0xfc9dd9), while not accomplishing _that_ much in terms of protection.\n\n**Why decrease the fork period?**\nOne downside of a lower fork threshold and potentially consecutive forks is that proposal execution is blocked during the fork period. The fork period is decreased to mitigate governance disruption while still providing honest minorities ample time to coordinate.\n\n*Thanks to 40 and Elad for co-penning this proposal, and to Necfas for providing a Noun.*","proposer":"0xA86882277E69FbF0a51805cdc8b0a3a113079E63","startBlock":18230389,"endBlock":18266389,"executed":true},"votes":[{"support":0,"voter":"0x008c84421dA5527F462886cEc43D2717B686A7e4","numberOfVotes":9,"reason":"Ill thought out"},{"support":1,"voter":"0x09b4CC17E0764E285bC147b3ADe34c1ac349AaAe","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x67DaCc258DCCc8CbFB493c652ab5170C3CFf0AD9","numberOfVotes":2,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0xA86882277E69FbF0a51805cdc8b0a3a113079E63","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":"An additional upside not mentioned in the prop:\n\nAs we steer the post-fork dao into a more opinionated direction (nouns distribution, burn mech), a lower threshold also provides unwilling participants a second chance for a way out."},{"support":1,"voter":"0x8e71C9644898665a91E4dB3Dee8bDde97b3C71BC","numberOfVotes":8,"reason":"Fork it!"},{"support":0,"voter":"0x2ED22eA03fEA3e5BD90f6Fdd52C20c26ff6e1300","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0xe3D73DAaE939518c3853e0E8e532ae707cC1A436","numberOfVotes":2,"reason":"I would go so far as to say that forking should be made continuous and individualized - in a perfectly permissionless, decentralized dao any individual should be able to fork when/how they want.

Recently, I've seamlessly combined my passion for sailing with my deep affection for Nouns, crafting sailing events in both Seoul and New York, with the generous support of Props 102 and 173. Sailing, often hailed as one of the most esteemed sports, never fails to attract the attention of the media, guests, and local residents alike.\n\nIn much the same way that Nouns effortlessly align with cultures centered around skateboarding and running, they also harmonize beautifully with sailing culture. While sailing may be less popular or perceived as more challenging to engage in, it stands as one of the most inclusive sports, welcoming individuals of all ages, backgrounds, and walks of life.\n\nI am eager to extend my love for sailing to the Nouns community by curating a series of sailing events throughout 2024. These gatherings will provide a splendid opportunity to gather and share our ideas about future of NounsDAO.\n\n# Why Nouns Sailing?\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HJjKkJqun.jpg)\nThe Nouns burgee flag debuted at the 2023 Nouns Sailing event during NFT.NYC, representing the spirit of Nouns and the tradition of the Nounish community. Sailing isn't just a sport; it's a symbol of dedication and camaraderie. Sailors are the ones we can entrust with building the legacy and traditions of the Nouns Burgee Flag.\n\n## 1. Sail with Nouns in New York Harbor for NFT.NYC 2024\n**[April 3rd, 2024]** Following the success of [Prop 102](https://nouns.wtf/vote/102) and [Prop 173](https://nouns.wtf/vote/173), I would like to organize a sailing event on April 3rd in New York with the help of the Manhattan Yacht Club. It is important to gather at least once a year to celebrate achievements, brainstorm ideas, and share thoughts. I believe New York is the best place for such gatherings. In April, it was an amazing experience to meet everyone for the first time in person. I think next year, we will have even more loyal people visiting New York.\n\n\n## 2. Support two Olympic sailors\n**[September 2024]** In 2024, all eyes will be on the Summer Paris Olympics. It presents a unique opportunity for us to showcase noggles during this prestigious event. Rather than simply purchasing advertisements, I suggest a more organic approach – sponsoring Olympic athletes. My hypothesis is that by supporting these athletes during the qualification season, they will appreciate our assistance and, in turn, proudly display noggles at the Olympic games.\n\nShould this initiative prove successful with sailors, we can explore extending our sponsorship to athletes in various other sports. My initial proposal is to sponsor two Olympic sailors during their qualification season. The Olympic Sailing Competition at Paris 2024 will comprise ten sailing events, with a total athlete quota of 330. Qualification rounds commenced in August 2023 and will continue until April 2024.\n\n## 3. Road to J/24 World Sailing Championship\n![](https://i.imgur.com/7uN5xdw.jpg)\nThe J/24 World Sailing Championship stands as one of the most prestigious international sailing competitions. Our preparations for this championship will span an entire year. By fielding teams to compete in the J/24 World Championship, we aim to introduce Nouns to a diverse audience with different backgrounda encompassing professional sailors, Olympic medalists, seasoned veterans, all-female teams, collegiate squads, dedicated enthusiasts, teenagers, and newcomers who share a passion for sailing J/24 boats.\n\nOur goal is to bring the Nouns community along on this journey to the J/24 World Championship! This event represents the pinnacle of sailing competition, and every sailor aspires to participate (List of J/24 championships - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J/24_World_Championship)). All teams involved will take immense pride in representing Nouns on such a grand stage.\n\nThroughout the year, we will engage in rigorous training and proudly display Nouns-themed spinnakers in various cities across Korea. We have identified some of the most picturesque locations, including beaches, islands, and areas with industrial landscapes.\n\nTo further promote Nouns, we commit to maintaining an active presence on social media platforms. Sending teams to compete at this prestigious event presents a remarkable opportunity to raise awareness of Nouns.\n\nOur dedication extends beyond the competition; we plan to work tirelessly throughout the year to promote Nouns. Regular updates on social media will offer insights into our practices, races, and maintenance routines. We'll showcase the elegance of Nounish spinnakers, whether in leisurely cruises or intense competitions. Additionally, we'll allocate time to master sailing maneuvers that may be less familiar to us as racers, such as figure sailing and cascade formations, which promise captivating visuals for photos.\n\n### Meet the Teams\n1.

Following player feedback, our intention is to release the full game by the end of 2024.\n\nThis specific proposal aims to secure funding for the release of the playable demo in December on the Steam store.\n\nUpon the release of the playable demo, the DAO will decide whether to provide further funding for the game.\n\n> **The full game will be released on the following top stores in 2024:**\n> \n>  - Steam Store\n>  - PlayStation Store\n>  - Xbox Store (Microsoft Store)\n>  - Epic Games Store\n>  - Nintendo Switch eShop\n\n---\n\n## Proposal Ask:\n\nWe are requesting **24 ETH** for a period of **60 days** to cover the following:\n - Final polishing of the playable demo.\n**`This crucial phase involves meticulous refinement to ensure a flawless gaming experience. It encompasses various tasks, such as fine-tuning character animations for seamless gameplay, replacing test sound effects and visual effects with their final counterparts to enhance immersion, conducting rigorous technical testing and debugging to eliminate any potential issues, and optimizing the final content for compatibility across a wide range of devices. Our goal is to deliver a polished, bug-free, and captivating demo that showcases the full potential of 'Nounishpunk' to our audience.`**\n\n - Production of marketing content and materials.\n**`This encompasses the creation of a wide range of promotional materials, including eye-catching posters, captivating trailers, and stunning concept art. These assets will be strategically designed to engage our target audience, build excitement, and effectively communicate the unique features and appeal of 'Nounishpunk' to potential players and supporters.`**\n\n*We are committed to providing propdates along the way.*\n\n---\n\n## Why 'Nounishpunk' Deserves DAO's Support?\n\nCheck out the excitement! People can't stop asking about the intriguing world of 'Nounishpunk' and its unique connection to the Nouns DAO. See how curiosity is piqued and interest is sky-high. It's clear that the Nouns culture is sparking intrigue far and wide through the Nounishpunk game.\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HyKHuRY1T.png)\n\n![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/614803058773196800/1154427287471665202/ezgif-5-8ec4b59c12.gif)\n\n**Here's the question:** Is a Nounish game designed to introduce players to Nouns DAO and its culture worthy of support and funding from DAO?\nWe believe that this game has the potential to generate significant exposure and positive advertising for DAO. Although we haven't even initiated a press release for the game, and without any external funding, we've strived to familiarize DAO with the world we've crafted, but we received encouraging feedback and it shows us that even with a small amount of support from DAO, we can make a significant impact.\n\n---\n## Who Are We?\n\nThe Genius Slackers team is an independent producer of video games. The company was founded in 2016 by Arash Negahban and Saeed Abbasi.\n\nYou probably know [Arash](https://twitter.com/ArashSlacker) for the animations and music videos he made for NounsDAO!\nHere’s some of the work I have done:\n\n- [Lil Nouns Music Video](https://twitter.com/ArashSlacker/status/1603321209613127680?s=20&t=7reei4hWvrg9tCth14J7MA) funded by Lil Nouns' [Content Pod](https://discord.com/channels/954142017556979752/1016388331602460773); music video!\n* This [Put Your Noggles On](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnNIvVETNvY); music video!\n* Animation promoting [lil nouns DAO](https://twitter.com/lilnounsdao/status/1685286013659209728?s=20).\n- this [Shrimpy Noun in a Burger](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e-3rIzsQWw) music video;\n- this [I'm The Bomb animation video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQjWXc2EHQk);\n- or this [Nounish GIPHY channel](https://giphy.com/channel/ArashNegahban/nounish) hosting a growing set of Nounish GIFs;\n- additionally, if you take a look at [my Twitter media](https://twitter.com/ArashSlacker/media), you will find even more Nounish animation content I have made in the past six months.\n\n![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1140710821878579325/1149368704363155546/ezgif-2-a85cb9a938s.gif)\n\n---\n\n## External Nounishpunk Partner \n\nWe are excited to unveil our partnership with **[Nouns Factory](https://nounsfactory.com)**.\nIn this collaboration, we are proud to be the creative force behind the 3D rendition of their distinctive clothing line. These designs will be seamlessly integrated into our game, allowing players to customize their avatars with these exclusive clothing options. What's particularly intriguing is that players will also have the opportunity to directly purchase these real-world garments through the game.\n\nThrough this endeavor, we are introducing players to the world of Nousnish fashion, inspiring them to become patrons of Nouns Factory.

He reenergizes with 'Public Good' drinks for that extra turbo boost while tackling side-missions and achievements intricately connected with 'ComicsDAO.' All of this unfolds within a futuristic cityscape adorned with Nounish art, particularly when equipped with the stylish 'Nouns Factory-Style' shirt and Nounish weapons that can be customized with decals from 'Stickers.fun.'\n\n\nThis promises to be the most Nounish project ever, offering an immersive experience where these remarkable brands seamlessly blend with Nounishpunk's distinctive universe.\n\n![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1147984938650578945/1149376993171869706/ezgif-3-Comic_Sticer.gif)\n\n---\n## What is Nounishpunk?\n\n* **Introduction**\nNounishpunk is an exhilarating, fast-paced third-person comedy action-adventure shooter set in an open world, boasting a captivating fantasy futurism art style.\nThe game thrusts players into an action adventure as they step into the shoes of a heroic figure.

This is a proposal for a (very) low-risk test to earn yield for the Nouns treasury by utilizing Origin Ether ([OETH](https://oeth.com/)). Converting 1 ETH into 1 OETH (they are 1:1) for 30 days would act as a case study to test that Nouns can safely earn high risk-adjusted yields for the treasury by utilizing OETH. \n\nOrigin Protocol is an OG team that launched in 2017. We launched OETH about 4 months ago, with the goal of making it possible for retail users to earn the same kind of yields that institutional traders earn, without needing millions of dollars and a full-fledged trading team. OETH deploys collateral to blue-chip protocols, distributing the yield back to holders daily via positive rebase. Current OETH yield is 8.01% APY on ETH, or about 2x that of the largest LSTs. \n\nWe have seen much larger test case props to Nouns ([Prop 320 for example](https://nouns.wtf/vote/320)); in our opinion this is much too large of an amount to test a new technology with, which is why we are proposing to begin with a 1 OETH test, and can submit an additional proposal in the future for an increased amount as the Nouns community becomes more familiar with OETH. \n\nThis proposal will include two transactions: the first to convert 1 ETH into 1 OETH, and the second to opt the Nouns wallet in for yield generation.\n\nA more detailed overview on the proposal and on how OETH works can be found below. \n\n![OETH Graphic](https://imageupload.io/ib/3Uu8NmrrBr6axiU_1695230390.png)\n\n## Stacking Treasury Yield With OETH\n\nPrevious Relevant Proposals:\n18 - [Stake 1 eth in Lido](https://nouns.wtf/vote/18)\n22 - [Stake 10% of treasury in Lido](https://nouns.wtf/vote/22)\n30 - [Stake additional 10% of treasury in Lido](https://nouns.wtf/vote/30)\n52 - [Increase Treasury stETH Position to ~20%](https://nouns.wtf/vote/52)\n217 - [Stake additional 5000 ETH in Lido](https://nouns.wtf/vote/217)\n227 - [Stake additional 5000 ETH in Lido](https://nouns.wtf/vote/227)\n313 - [stETH peg protection](https://nouns.wtf/vote/313)\n320 - [Treasury Diversification](https://nouns.wtf/vote/320)\n\n**Summary**: \n\nThis is a proposal to convert 1 ETH into 1 Origin Ether ([OETH](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/origin-ether)) to test OETH yield generation for the Nouns treasury.\n\n**Abstract**:\n\nThis is a low-risk test to increase the yield of the Nouns treasury ETH/stETH from 0-4% to 8-10% utilizing Origin Ether (OETH). Converting 1 ETH into 1 OETH for 30 days would form a similar hypothesis as proposal 18 - in this case, that Nouns can safely stack yields utilizing OETH. \n\n**Motivation**:\n\nFrom proposals 18, 22, 30, 52, 217, and 227, it is clear that the Nouns DAO was interested in earning yield on the treasury and extending the project runway. Proposal 313 signals that the community would prefer to continue earning yield with stETH, instead of eliminating risk completely and converting entirely back to ETH. Proposal 320 signals that other mainnet LSTs can be useful for treasury diversification. \n\nThe OETH TVL has been trending upwards at a rate of about $1m per day since launch and has been crushing it in comparison to direct competitors with the yield we are generating. OETH yield is currently at 8.01% APY, whereas icETH APY is down to 2.94% and Cian stETH strategy is down to 4.02% despite taking leverage.\n\nWe are proposing to begin with 1 OETH, and can submit an additional proposal in the future to increase the amount as the community becomes more familiar with OETH. OETH provides significantly increased yields while also protecting against centralization and slashing events. \n\n\n## OETH Overview\n\nOrigin Ether was launched in May 2023 and is an ERC20 LST aggregator that generates blue chip yield while sitting in your wallet. OETH is backed 1:1 by stETH, rETH, frxETH, ETH, and WETH at all times; holders can go in and out of OETH as they please. Similar to stETH, OETH yield is paid out daily and automatically (sometimes multiple times per day) through a positive rebase in the form of additional OETH, proportional to the amount of OETH held.\n\nOETH yield, currently ~8.00% APY, comes from a combination of:\n\n1. Deploying ETH/WETH on Curve, Convex, and Morpho\n2. LST validator rewards\n3. A 50bip exit fee is charged to those who choose to exit OETH via the [dapp](https://app.oeth.com/) (completely avoidable if using a DEX), this fee goes back to OETH holders\n4. OETH sitting in non-upgradable smart contracts does not rebase, instead the interest generated from those tokens is provided to those that can rebase\n\nThese 4 yield generating functions combined enable OETH to generate higher yields than holding or farming any single LST manually. The current collateral allocation and yield strategies can be seen on-chain at all times via the [OETH analytics page](https://www.oeth.com/analytics). Future OETH collateral and yield strategies are governed by [OGV stakers](https://governance.ousd.com/stake).\n\nObtaining OETH is seamless, anyone can convert from ETH, stETH, rETH, or frxETH into OETH via any of the following methods:\n\n- Minting on [OETH.com](https://app.oeth.com/)\n- Swapping on [Curve](https://curve.fi/#/ethereum/pools/factory-v2-298/deposit)\n- Swapping on [Uniswap](https://app.uniswap.org/#/swap?inputCurrency=0x856c4efb76c1d1ae02e20ceb03a2a6a08b0b8dc3&outputCurrency=ETH)\n- Swapping on [Maverick](https://app.mav.xyz/pool?chain=1&tokenA=0x856c4efb76c1d1ae02e20ceb03a2a6a08b0b8dc3&tokenB=0xc02aaa39b223fe8d0a0e5c4f27ead9083c756cc2&fee=0.0004&width=0.001) \n- Swapping on [Sushiswap](https://app.sushi.com/swap?inputCurrency=ETH&outputCurrency=0x856c4Efb76C1D1AE02e20CEB03A2A6a08b0b8dC3&chainId=1)\n\nFor this proposal, Nouns will be using [The Zapper](https://docs.oeth.com/core-concepts/the-zapper) to convert the 1 ETH into 1 OETH. A second transaction will also be included to ensure the Nouns wallet is [opted-in for yield generation](https://docs.oeth.com/core-concepts/elastic-supply/rebasing-and-smart-contracts). \n\n**Benefits of Using OETH**\n\nThere are a few reasons for why Nouns would choose to use OETH over of attempting to use the same yield strategies: \n\n- The yield will always be higher with OETH than if you were to use any of the same yield strategies, since not all OETH is opted-in for yield, and because of the exit fee. At the moment 23,731 OETH is collecting yield and 21,280 is not, so Nouns would receive this boost in yield from the OETH opted-out. With the exit fee Nouns would get paid each time there's an exit - occasionally this puts the combined yield into the 100s!\n\n- The Curve/Convex strategy would be very difficult (if not impossible) to replicate without having a Curve pool with a gauge + millions in TVL - Nouns would essentially need its own token and voting power and would be competing for yield with the other large flywheel token holders. \n\n- If Nouns were to do the same strategies, someone would need to manage the position. The OETH protocol would be that manager, with collateral reallocated among the whitelisted yield strategies each week. \n\n- The OETH protocol chases not just the highest yields but also the safest. During the weekend of March 10 when USDC and DAI depegged, it took the OUSD strategists/Origin engineers about 4 minutes to notice the depeg, and 16 minutes to start the process of moving the funds to a safer strategy. $0 were lost! \n\n- The OETH protocol covers all gas costs for moving funds between yield strategies, which is happening weekly but eventually will happen daily. With the price of gas on Ethereum, this could get costly for Nouns if Nouns were to follow the same reallocation schedule. \n\n- The cost for security - Origin has OpenZeppelin on retainer! Every new OETH contract is audited before going live. OETH security is prioritized over new feature development. The same level of security would cost Nouns millions of dollars in audit and development costs. \n\n- Top-notch development team - OETH shares 95% of the same code as OUSD, which has been live on mainnet for more than 3 years - longer than the Nouns DAO! The battle-tested code that has seen almost $400m combined has been and continues to be developed by a team of 10 full-time engineers. This level of talent required to maintain the smart contracts would be extremely expensive for Nouns, if Nouns were to try and replicate the OETH strategies. \n\n\n## Usage of Funds Generated\n\nSince launch, OETH has earned a yield of about 2x that of stETH yield. With the extra yield generated for the Nouns treasury, there are several avenues for using the additional funds:\n\n- Subsidizing public goods spend - Nouns traditionally spends ~800 ETH per month on public goods\n- Subsidizing Nouns marketing - this would offset the cost for future Nouns movies, paid promotions, conference expenses, swag, and Noggles \n- Subsidizing Nouns infrastructure and auction expenses \n- Subsidizing cost for collaboration with other projects - Pudgy Penguins is just the beginning! \n- Funding large team efforts for less - it would take 50% of the stETH yield to fund another Nounish or Agora sized team effort\n- Extended DAO runway - Nouns would extend the project runway twice as long\n\n\n**Community Cases for Increased Yield**\n\nI also don't think getting to our eth position to 100% staked eth limits our spending in any way… the ~500 ETH additional yield we'll get from staking the 10k ETH is not nothing. It's being able to fund another ~$1M / year sized team. That's like being able to fund another nounish or agora sized team effort, which is meaningful! - *Noun40*\n\nI think the DAO should maintain around ~6mo of operating spend as ETH… diversify into other staking providers to reduce concentration risk. Overall in agreement with staking more ETH to increase runway. - *cfeng.eth*\n\nThe income generated from holding stETH also amounts to ~500 ETH / yr, which is more than 2 weeks of auctions. - *noun12.eth*\n\nstETH is a better way of holding eth - *fugazi.eth*\n\nI believe there is already too much of the treasury being staked in Lido. I am not interested in staking more, and if I were, I would want to use some other protocol that isn't Lido since we already have a lot in Lido. - *onnnnnnnion.eth*\n\n\n\n## Potential Risks and Mitigation\n\nThere are six possible risks when using OETH, and Origin is making sure to reduce each risk as much as possible:\n\n*New token risk* - Given OETH is a relatively new token, some may be worried that OETH is prone to new attack surfaces. While this may be true for other new tokens, OETH was built reusing 95% of the OUSD code, of which 10+ audits have been done since 2020. Not that long ago, [OUSD reached a market cap of $300m](https://defillama.com/protocol/origin-dollar) without breaking, and without diminishing the APY it was capable of generating. Origin continues to work on OUSD, despite the lower market cap.\n\n*Counterparty risk* - OETH is governed by OGV stakeholders around the world. Everything from yield generation to fee collection and distribution is managed by a set of smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. These contracts are upgradeable with a timelock and are controlled by hundreds of governance token holders. While the initial contracts and yield-earning strategies were developed by the Origin team, anyone can shape the future of OETH by creating or voting on proposals, submitting new strategies, or contributing code improvements. We intend for all important decisions to be made through community governance and limited powers to be delegated to trusted contributors who are more actively involved in the day-to-day management of the protocol.\n\n*Smart contract risk of the yield strategies* - Origin is only using platforms for yield generation that have a proven track record, have been audited, have billions in TVL, maintain a bug bounty program, and provide over-collateralized loans. Over-collateralization in itself, combined with liquidations, provides a reasonable level of security for lenders.\n\n*Collateral risk* - Origin has chosen 3 of the largest LSTs to ever exist to back OETH, and they have maintained their peg quite well since launch. They have also demonstrated significant growth in circulating supply, so the Origin team is confident that the 3 LSTs will maintain their peg and that OETH will remain stable to ETH. To ensure accurate pricing at all times, OETH is using Chainlink oracles for pricing data for rETH and stETH, and a dual oracle for frxETH that combines two sources: the Curve frxETH/ETH EMA oracle and the Uniswap frxETH/FRAX TWAP oracle. In situations where any OETH collateral falls below peg, [OIP-4 disables minting](https://github.com/OriginProtocol/origin-dollar/issues/1000) of additional OETH tokens using the de-pegged asset.\n\n*Slashing risk* - Since OETH is collateralized by multiple LSTs at the same time, OETH is protected from slashing from any individual collateral LST. If there is a small slash, the OETH yield will simply decrease, as income will likely exceed the size of the slash. During a major slashing event, both the slashed LST and OETH will experience a drop in value relative to ETH, but OETH should not fall as low and for as long as the slashed LST, as the remaining un-slashed OETH LSTs will soften the blow. There will never be a negative OETH rebase.\n\n*Smart contract risk of OETH* - Origin is taking every step possible to be proactive and lessen the chance of losing funds. Security reviews are prioritized over new feature development, with regular audits being done, and multiple engineers are required to review each code change with a detailed checklist. There are timelocks before protocol upgrades are launched, and deep dives into the exploits of other protocols are constantly being done to make sure the same exploits don’t exist on Origin contracts. Security is extremely important to the Origin team. OETH was built reusing 95% of the OUSD code, of which 10+ audits have been done since 2020. All audits can be seen on [Audits - OETH](https://docs.oeth.com/security-and-risks/audits) , and OpenZeppelin is now on retainer. On-chain insurance protocol InsurAce awarded OETH and OUSD the [highest possible security rating of AAA](https://app.insurace.io/coverage/buycovers), of which only 3 other projects on the InsurAce platform have received. Optional OETH cover is currently available for both OETH and OUSD on InsurAce. Origin Defi also maintains a $1m bug bounty through [Immunefi](https://immunefi.com/explore/), with a resolution time of 7 hours. \n\n\nExternal OETH analysis:\n\n[Llama Risk](https://cryptorisks.substack.com/p/asset-risk-assessment-origin-ether) - Asset Risk Assessment: Origin Ether (OETH)\n[Auxo](https://mirror.xyz/auxo.eth/1NXxHhJmj44EfHmvA5pEH7mpSLtg-CbYRqmuEkaTRRk) - OETH - Protocol Analysis\n\n\nOETH in the news:\n\n[Coindesk](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2023/05/16/origin-protocol-enters-competitive-ether-yield-market-with-oeth-offering/) - Origin Protocol Enters Competitive Ether Yield Market With OETH Offering \n[TokenInsight](https://tokeninsight.com/en/news/origin-protocol-launches-yield-aggregating-eth-derivative-called-oeth) - Origin Protocol Launches Yield Aggregating $ETH Derivative Called $OETH \n[Blockster](https://blockster.com/maximize-eth-staking-yields-with-oeth-a-yield-bearing-ether-pegged-token-by-origin-protocol) - Maximize ETH Staking Yields with OETH: A Yield-Bearing, Ether-Pegged Token by Origin Protocol \n\n**Closing Thoughts**\n\nPeter is a core member of [Origin Protocol](https://originprotocol.com/) and is joined by the fully doxxed Origin team and community, which includes hundreds of thousands of members and open-source contributors.

Origin Protocol’s corporate treasury is also holding millions of dollars in OETH. We have skin in the game and are willing to put our own money at risk with the code we have written.\n\nThere are no lockups with this proposal, Nouns can move in and out of OETH as the Nouncil, core team, DAO, and community desires. OETH remains completely liquid at all times, and can be spent in the same way as its backing collateral, if unexpected expenses were to arise.\n\n","proposer":"0xcC4Fd6e348009710404641a01b29f15703b90aed","startBlock":18245401,"endBlock":18281401,"executed":false},"votes":[{"support":1,"voter":"0x0658f4eD17289144717713ADfFC2539eF7c2EF8e","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":0,"voter":"0x2ED22eA03fEA3e5BD90f6Fdd52C20c26ff6e1300","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x008c84421dA5527F462886cEc43D2717B686A7e4","numberOfVotes":9,"reason":"Let's test"},{"support":1,"voter":"0xE7304bA0f157f2Ade94015934284b6704BC72911","numberOfVotes":2,"reason":"We already have so much staked inside LIDO, we should definitely diversify out of it if we can.

[NDJ's Prop House](https://prop.house/nouns-japan)  has been a cornerstone of our growth and community engagement. However, we have noticed a decline in activity since our last round, Round-10. Consequently, this issue has been concerned many of us who see the immense potential in our local community.\n\nOne Major hurdle is the language barrier. Many Prop House events are in English, limiting the participation of our largely Japanese-speaking community.\n\nTo address this gap, we would like to kindly request your financial support to re-launch and sustain our Prop House for a period of one year. We believe this will boost Nouns DAO's brand awareness in Japan and create valuable content. We'll also look for self-funding options during this period. \n\n**Total ask: 18 ETH**.\n- Rewards: 0.5 ETH * 5 props * 6 times = 15ETH\n- Operations & Public Relations: 1 ETH/year * 3 persons = 3 ETH\n\n# What is Nouns DAO Japan\nPokemon, Hello Kitty, Anpanman, Super Mario, Dragon Ball, One Piece, Naruto, etc... Japan is home to iconic characters and boasts a rich culture of derivative works and cosply. This cibrant creative scene serves as fertile ground for talented creators. \n\nNouns DAO Japan (NDJ) is the largest Nouns community in Japan with approximately 3,300 members. Various creators, mainly Japanese, participate in NDJ and enjoy creating secondary Nouns works while engaging in friendly competition.\n\n\nThe following is a corner of the creativity from NDJ.\n## Nouns New Parts Creation\n ![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/H14J-ArJT.png)\n The beluga created by [amiyoko](https://twitter.com/amiyoko_eth) on the left was adopted for [Anniversary Art 2023](https://nouns.wtf/vote/348).\n\n## Nouns Base\n![](https://i.seadn.io/gcs/files/c878d0a2d11b92ce308d9b403855ce35.gif)\nNouns secondary production created by [KURAN](https://twitter.com/KURAN_Nouns). A secret base to build with friends.\n\n## And more\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SJHbi0Sk6.png)\nMany creators gather at NDJ to create fascinating works of art!\n\n\n# Why should Nouns DAO invest in the Prop House of Japan\nJapanese creators have uniquely blended local culture with NounsDAO's vision, generating captivating content. However, activity has slowed since Prop House Funding ceased after Round-10.\n\nVarious communities are holding Prop House, but unfortunately, only a limited number of Japanese are able to participate in other Prop House because of their poor English skills.\n\nIt is a great loss for Nouns DAO that during this time, talented creators from the character powerhouse of Japan are leaving Nouns DAO.\n\n# Prop House Recipients of Support\nHere are some of the achievements supported by NDJ's Prop House.\n## Nouns National Baton Relay ([Round-1](https://prop.house/nouns-japan/round-1/653))\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BJssgkIyT.png)\nThe baton relay is actually handed over in the real world as “Noggles = Baton\".　This initiative will increase loyalty to the Nouns DAO by directly connecting people who love Nouns with each other in Japan.\n\n## pNouns ([Round-5](https://prop.house/nouns-japan/round-5/2027))\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/H1O-5WwJT.png)\n\n[pNouns](https://pnouns.wtf/en/) is an experimental project that has the potential to fundamentally change the social structure with ”real NFT” and ”real DAO”. We are going to become a member of Nouns DAO, recognized ”real DAO” and propose a project to the pooled 35 million treasury.\n\n## Ethereum Navi ([Round-5,6,7](https://prop.house/nouns-japan/round-5/1949))\n[Ethereumnavi](https://ethereumnavi.com/tag/nouns/) specializes in cutting-edge Crypto native NFT projects, Web3 development information such as Solidity, and other information around Ethereum.\nThe platform features accessible articles on Nouns, significantly contributing to the project's expansion in Japan.\n\n## UNouns ([Round-6](https://prop.house/nouns-japan/round-6/2540))\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/Bk83oQD16.png)\n\n[UNouns](https://unouns.wtf/) = Nouns doing United Nations. UNouns attempts to create community and governance that will access global issues, SDGs and create better world by utilizing treasury, that can be used by the community.

After that, we will consider our own ongoing measures.\n\n**Expand community:** Attract new participants to NDJ and increase credibility and awareness of Nouns DAO in Japan.\n\n# Operations\n### Hosting Of Prop House\nlead: [Eiba](https://twitter.com/eiba8884)\n- Prop house will be held every 2 months.\n- Set up a reward of 0.5 ETH*5 from the funds donated.\n- Giveaway [NDJ PFP](https://opensea.io/collection/nouns-dao-japan-pfp) to the person who gets the most votes each time.\n- Voting right will be [POAP](https://opensea.io/collection/nounsdaojapanpoap) issued by Nouns DAO Japan once every six months.\n### Public Relations\nleads: [Takumi](https://twitter.com/Okirakukai) & [Daynao](https://twitter.com/daynao_daynao)\n- Regular space will be held daily.

Our objective is to establish a new branch within the DAO, a more mature and secure space where artists can freely express their interpretations of nounish in art space. Simultaneously, we encourage the DAO to approach this topic with an open heart and mind. By promoting dialogue and understanding, we aim to challenge preconceived notions and nurture a more mature, accepting, and diverse community.\n\n\n\n**Note:** The project's creators have chosen to maintain their anonymity, prioritizing a focus on the project's message and artistic vision rather than individual recognition. \n\n\n\n# First Shot : Sensuality\n\n**Introduction:** In the world of art, sensuality has always played a vital role in evoking emotions, pushing societal boundaries, and expanding creative horizons. This proposal aims to investigate the profound connection between sensuality and art, while seeking funding for a project that celebrates and explores sensuality in various forms. By delving into this captivating topic, we aspire to craft a thought-provoking experience that visually engages and inspires the community. \nKeywords: Sensuality, art, community.\n\n**Body:**\n\nThe proposed project aims to create seven immersive art pieces, each representing different expressions of sensuality applied to characteristic nouns, corresponding to the seven days of the week. By collaborating with four esteemed photography artists, our goal is to craft a visual experience that celebrates sensuality and its richness.\n\nThese pieces will be thoughtfully curated to explore various facets of sensuality, including its ties to human emotions and the natural world. Through meticulously designed works of art, we aim to prompt viewers to contemplate their own perceptions of sensuality and challenge societal norms surrounding this often-misunderstood concept.\n\nTo ensure the success of this project, we are seeking funding to cover several aspects, including artist fees, additional incentives, production, and the care of these pieces. By securing the necessary funds, we can provide artists and staff with the resources they require to create impactful and thought-provoking artworks.\n\nFurthermore, this project aspires to extend beyond its initial phase. Future plans include organizing more immersive and expressive materials, enabling viewers to engage visually and musically.\n\n\n\n**Rise of Sensuality:**\n\nSensuality, often considered taboo in many cultures, holds delicate curves and unique identity within the body. Art, in its purest form, serves as a means of self-expression for the body, a visual language.\n\nAllow me to introduce one of the guest artists - [Guido](https://x.com/guidodisalle), a renowned name in photography, known for his aesthetic sensibilities and indescribable visual prowess.\n\n![](https://imgur.com/k4RMWal.jpeg)\n\n[Guido Di Salle's](https://www.flowcode.com/page/guido)\n\n**Minting and Distribution**\n\nOut of the seven pieces produced, only two will be made available for minting as limited editions, created by our invited artists. Details will be provided on each guest artist's profile when unveiling their piece.\n\n**Cost:** 7E to cover team expenses, provide additional incentives, and compensate the artists + 4 NounsVision to be sent to invited artists.\n\n**Conclusion:** In conclusion, this project seeks to explore the captivating intersection of sensuality and art through an immersive experience that can enrich our cultural understanding and initiate a new community. With secured funding, we can embark on a journey with talented artists to create a transformative experience, challenging societal norms and celebrating diverse expressions of nounish in the world of art.","proposer":"0xF9Fb122664D96e7F188a0c15B4F90F247e707567","startBlock":18287198,"endBlock":18323198,"executed":false},"votes":[{"support":1,"voter":"0x2666f0C8FB58d182f2Dd79475DCA4A07B3724607","numberOfVotes":3,"reason":"Not really sure where I stand on this proposal, however I think showing the diversity of nouns brand to go beyond cute characters to sexuality is an interesting experiment.

The goals for the burn are described in the blog post above by wilson.\n\nThis is a first draft of the proposal candidate through which we will ask the DAO to fund one or two audits of the implementation. We are putting it up even before we have quotes from auditors, in order to raise awareness among voters, stimulate the conversation, and listen to feedback.\n\n## Technical spec\n\nWe plan to deploy a new contract, with a single function that lets burn excess ETH from the timelock.\n\n### How much will be burned?\n\nExcess ETH is defined as the difference between the treasury value denominated in ETH, and: adjusted_total_supply * trailing_N_day_mean_auction_price.\n\nadjusted_total_supply is the number of minted nouns, excluding nouns held by the treasury or in the escrow contract.\n\nIn order to calculate the treasury value in ETH, the contract will consider only ETH, stETH, rETH & WETH. All other assets are ignored.\n\nThe number of auctions looked at when calculating the mean price is a configurable parameter; we suggest starting with 90.\n\nExample based on numbers close to actuals:\n\nTreasury has 2857 ETH, 10830 stETH, 228 rETH.\nAdjusted total supply: 394.\nMean price of last 90 auctions: 30 ETH.\nTreasury value in ETH: 2857 + 10830 + 247 (228 worth of rETH) = 13,934 ETH.\nExcess ETH: 13,934 - 30 * 394 = 2114 ETH.\n\n### What is burned?\n\nOnly ETH is burned. If the Nouns runs out of ETH, it will need to swap other assets (e.g. stETH) into ETH to allow for more burn.\n\n### When can it be called?\n\nThe goal is for the burn to happen at predictable times. One parameter will define what will be the first noun id at which the first burn can happen. Another parameter will define how many noun ids need to be minted before the next burn can happen.\n\nExample:\n\nSuppose the first noun id is set to 1000, and the number of nouns between burns is set to 100. The first burn will be possible once a noun with id 1000 is minted. The next burn would be possible once a noun with id 1100 is minted.\n\nEven if the first burn actually occurs when noun 1002 is auctioned, the next burn will still be possible starting id 1100.\n\n\n### Timelock upgrade\n\nThe timelock will be upgraded to a new version which will allow the burner contract to call it an burn ETH.\n\nThe timelock will only allow the burner contract to call it.\n\nThe address of the burner contract is a configurable param. Setting it to the zero address is effectively turning off the burn mechanism.\n\n\n## Audit costs\n\nOur plan is to undergo a deep code review with solimander, and an audit with [Sherlock](https://www.sherlock.xyz/). In a bit more detail:\n\n1. Soli review (+ verbs fix things)\n2. Sherlock audit\n3. Verbs fix things + soli reviews fixes\n4. Sherlock mitigation review\n\nWe are asking for 30K USDC to be sent to the Tech Grants Pod multisig to pay for the audit.\n\n## Next steps\n\nFunding the audit will let us know the DAO wants the burn to be deployed. Once funded we will finalize the code, undergo the audit, and follow up with a proposal to upgrade the auction house contract and the treasury contract.\n\nThe upgrade will leave the burn disabled, since it seems best to separate the deployment of the mechanism from reaching consensus on its parameters. We will of course support any voters who will want to follow up with a proposal to set the burn parameters.\n\nIt's also worthwhile for voters to consider converting stETH into ETH ahead of the burn, since as mentioned above this simple design only burns native ETH.\n\n## Appendix: pseudocode\n\nExcessETHBurner:\n\n```\n\n// configurable params:\n\nuint numPastAuctions;\n\nuint nextBurnNounId;\n\nuint mintsBetweenBurns;\n\nfunction burnExcessETH() {\n\n    if (auction().nounId &lt; nextBurnNounId) revert('Not yet');\n\n    \n\n    allowedTreasuryInETH = adjustTotalSupply() * meanAuctionPrice();\n\n    excessETH = treasuryValueInETH() - allowedTreasuryInETH;\n\n    amountToBurn = min(excessETH, timelock.balance);\n\n    \n\n    nextBurnNounId += mintsBetweenBurns;\n\n    \n\n    timelock.burnETH(amountToBurn);\n\n}\n\nfunction treasuryValueInETH() {\n\n    return timelock.balance + stETH.balanceOf(timelock) + \n\n        wETH.balanceOf(timelock) + rETH.getEthValue(rETH.balanceOf(timelock));\n\n}\n\nfunction meanAuctionPrice() {\n\n    return mean(auctionHouse.prices(numPastAuctions));\n\n}\n\n```\n\n\n## Appendix: current asset breakdown\n\nAt the time of writing this text, [according to Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/tokenholdings?a=0xb1a32FC9F9D8b2cf86C068Cae13108809547ef71):\n\n\n\n* Total treasury value is roughly $23.15M.\n* Its two main assets are:\n    * ETH at $4.391M (2631.493 ETH).\n    * stETH at $18.061M (10830.768 stETH).\n* These two assets alone make up over 96.7% of the total treasury value.\n* USDC is roughly 1.1% of the treasury, and we’re comfortable ignoring it for the sake of code simplicity.\n* wstETH is roughly 0.11% and is ignored as well.","proposer":"0xffAF62026731607c5087a44BBa2CbCE1Fc908d99","startBlock":18300439,"endBlock":18329239,"executed":true},"votes":[{"support":0,"voter":"0xf6B6F07862A02C85628B3A9688beae07fEA9C863","numberOfVotes":22,"reason":""},{"support":0,"voter":"0x7f64C6e6908DE72221A06A06b4a02A6546a4d6d2","numberOfVotes":2,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0xFC218F1164cfEf8e4EC7c2aca8fB019DC8976214","numberOfVotes":20,"reason":"(noun40 voting via agora)\n\nthe concerns around not having good props to spend on ahead of the burn are likely a bit over blown imo. we already have a stoopid buddy (nouns stories) prop asking for $1.8M. maybe that doesn't pass. but the rise of blus atrium movie could easily ask for another $1M? nounish is likely going to come for an 6 mo extension with a $0.5-1M prop too? esports will also likely come back for 2024 funding with a \\~$1M prop? these are just our existing best executing teams that could easily ask for $2-3M. that's already more than the 2114 ETH excess eth burn amount calculated here. of course true market price of nouns might be 20 ETH instead of 30 when we have real price discovery. but then also we're experiencing fork #1 which will reduce the treasury size further.

Currently this burn is to arbitragers. I'm not sure if anyone has run the total on what was arbed out in the last for but I'd guess > $2M. \n\nSomething has to change. \n\nThere are several proposals. The alternatives I am aware of--things like capped exit, timelocking funds--have significant downsides. \n\nTimelocking hurts honest actors: imagine honest forkers trying to leave have their funds cut by a DAO voting to lock the funds away. \n\nCapped exit arbitrarily disadvantages certain nouners owners solely based on the price their noun was sold for at auction. It would warp the secondary market: nouns bought at a higher auction price are worth more. And why? Why does a secondary buyer of a Noun auctioned for a high price deserve more in a fork? Why is an honest actor who bought at a low price and wants to fork capped in how much they can take away? \n\nMoreover the energy of these proposals is hyper focused on eliminating the arbitrage, which I fund uncharismatic. No one want to join a DAO that is primarily focused on not getting arbed. \n\nWith the burn, I think we have a chance to fix the arb, while actually being primarily focused on more exciting things. I would support the burn even if the arb was not an issue. Already I see the burn forcing healthy conversation on things that were already issues, like, \"What if it just amounts to a new round of funding to past proposers?\" If the DAO is captured by past proposers, I'd like to know sooner than later!  And the burn is creating efforts to break out to new proposer audiences. \n\nThe assumption of the opposition is that having more time leads to better outcomes. Sometimes! Generally not in young organizations. Things tend to happen quickly or not at all. Slow often = dead. Nouns is not a hedge fund with a salaried staff. There is more at play. We need attention from the voters to do well. We need attention from proposers. Slow often means less attention. People stop caring. \"Nothing is happening over there.\" \n\nWhat's the downside of the burn? It's pretty capped in my opinion. The DAO can vote to remove it. The DAO can mitigate via rapidly distributing the treasury Nouns. There are lots of options. \n\nBut I think in the best case we get to test a theory: that Nouns spending more aggressively will lead to better outcomes. And not *just* trying haphazardly to spend more aggressively, but doing so in a legible context: voters and proposers alike know the DAO is highly incentivized to spend X by a certain date. This is super helpful for organizing in a decentralized context. \n\nThat's my thinking, eager to hear yours.

With respect, I disagree with this approach. I don't think that as it stands today, our community is ready for this level of forced acceleration in spending, and don't think in general that it is wise to be forced to spend.\n\nAs someone who firmly believes in the meme value of Nouns, and is willing to invest heavily into it, I see this proposal as strictly increasing the overall risk of the project. If we think we are currently on track to spend the excess value by the burn date, then why have this mechanism at all?\n\nIf we want Nouns to last years to come, there will inevitably be dry spells, and we don't want to be forced into allocating into things that we wouldn't otherwise have just to avoid burning. If we're dissatisfied with the progress of some of our biggest spends, we want to be able to credibly say \"hey, you need to change this or we might not be excited to fund you again\". The burn removes that ability.\n\nWhile it's true that more positive spend generates more attention from voters and proposers, I don't think it's the \"healthy\" way to do that. If we want to attract quality artists and builders, then we need to do the hard work of making Nouns more attractive to proposers by solving the friction points they experience today.\n\nIf attracting proposers is the goal, I'd rather see us invest in things like: extending candidate functionality, function tipping for clients, streaming payments tied to propdates, nouns retro-rewards, droposals, creating an incentive for proposal sponsors, etc.\n\nAs a builder, I should be excited about the burn because technically the DAO is now \"forced\" to spend more, but I'm not, because it doesn't solve any of the underlying mechanical issues that make contributing to Nouns DAO difficult. Throwing more money at the problem will make it seem like things are better, when in fact might actually make it harder to figure out where the builder pain points are.\n\nAlthough the Burn might be exciting in the short term (and to be honest, I personally can't help but be excited to see how the experiment plays out), I worry that it unnecessarily jeopardizes the long term survivability of Nouns. Yes, we can technically \"unship\" it, but the reality is that once in, it'll be very hard to gather the social consensus to take it out, just like the fork.

The conclusion is that the spec does not adequately discourage toxic buying interest and mitigate long-term financially-motivated forking pressure. \n\nTo address, burn must continue, every day, proportional to the real volatility of the Nouns meme and the degree of 'moneyness' of the exit price. \n//\n\nThe reason v3 creates endless downward pressure on the treasury is because it issues a perpetual put option to a holder (or coordinated holders) with access to a % of Nouns >= the forking threshold struck at book value.  \n\nA put option is simply the right to sell an asset at a pre-arranged price (the 'strike' price, in this case, current pro-rata bv), and are widely used by hedgers as insurance on asset value loss. Nouns is first to market with meme insurance! I will use the option language going forward since I think it provides the greatest clarity, and will leave pricing math/models out (provide in other forums if of interest).\n\nTo the best of my knowledge there is no way to expressly eliminate this option as an asset bundled to a Noun without further constraining the fork mechanic. So, this means the problem to solve is how to properly price the put option so that the dao is compensated for assuming leveraged downside risk, or, at the very least, so that the token buyer is levied an appropriate fee to disincentivize free riders/option-value investors. \n\nOptions carry asymmetric upside (call options have unlimited return potential, and puts have potential to yield 100% of the strike price). In exchange for this upside, the option buyer must pay something to the seller. The seller, in this case, is Nouns DAO. What is an everlasting put option on Nouns worth? How much are we charging?   \n\nPositive value of the put consists of 2 primary components: \n\n1. Intrinsic value- This refers to the value the option has if 'exercised' immediately. If the value of a Noun at auction/secondary is 20 and the exit value is 30, the intrinsic value is 10. Paying anything less than 10 for the option gives you, more or less, the infamous 'rfv.'  The burn is solely focused on trying to reduce, or, in the minds of some advocates, eliminate this piece completely from new auction buying interest by driving the exit price at or below the sale price. \n\n2. Extrinsic value- This refers to the insurance value the option has even if it is not 'in-the-money.' Having the perpetual right to sell a Noun at 30 has value, even if the auction price is 35, 50, 100, etc. Naturally, that value is reduced the higher the current market premium to the exit price becomes. The spec'd burn does not systemically address this value. However, as the % of the value of a Noun it is generally the more significant term, particularly when exit value is near parity with (or even resolutely below) auction prices. One of the main reasons for this is that the options term is perpetual. \n\nPricing perpetual options: \n\nVanilla options expire, which means the cost is proportional to the risk term. If you buy a put, or insurance (generally), it is not good forever. You pay a cost for a certain period of coverage. V3 insurance is different. We can't assign a fixed cost since the option is always good. The way this sort of asset is ordinarily priced is via a funding rate debiting at regular intervals until the option 'buyer' is out of capital to maintain the position. Its a subscription plan.\n\nNouns is, again, different. The tool to tax the option owner is not directly with new fees, but by progressively reducing the value of the option via burn. This assesses a fee to all option holders by intervallically reducing exit price. A burn can make the cost-of-carry of Noun ownership much more predictable and closely matched with its inherent value. The further the premium of market value to bv becomes, less burn is required. \n\nExtrinsic value is figured according to the 'implied volatility' of the underlying asset. Volatility measures how much an asset changes in value over a period of time (independent of direction), and you can arrive at a statistically 'fair' value for an option if you have a good estimate of the underlying asset's volatility. At time of writing, for a year of $28k price insurance for BTC, for example, you must pay 20% of the current value (around $5.6k). Note the intrinsic value of this option is (at time of writing) $0. Also note crypto is in the midst of a historically low-volatility regime. In more active markets the amount could be 40% or even higher. These values correspond to a (current) low of 52% up to 100% implied annualized volatility.   \n\nIn Nouns, a reasonable estimated range for the annual real value of an 'at-the-money' put (ie when exit value = auction value) would generally be worth between 35-95% of the market value of the asset. This uses a range of 100-250% implied volatility, & annualized burn rate would need to be in the range of 35-95% as long as auction price is near bv.\n\nThe values mentioned above frame the issue conservatively. Notice that implied volatility (extrinsic value) can not be well modeled using historical auction prices as long as there is intrinsic value arbitrage; meme value volatility is locally swallowed by the 1st order rfv. Instead, we can use pre-v3 auction prices (which, too are imperfect, due to the presence of bv-minded investors from the beginning), or the volatility of correlated assets (pfps, etc). As is hopefully intuitive to most, the volatility of memes is...not low.  \n\nIf we want to charge less, or nothing, we can, but it opens the dao to severe stochastic arbitrage, and we likely invite in a voter base comprised primarily of volatility scalpers, the treasury operating as a bi-directional slush fund for the trade. \n\nAs drop in bv outpaces drop in 'meme value' (here generally meant as the fungible value of a Noun independent of exit value), the burn may slow, but never fully stop, since a perpetual 'out of the money' put holds nontrivial value. For example, an exit value at 15 with current meme value at 30, using an implied volatility of 150%, implies an annualized burn of 20%. \n\nBurn must continue, every day, proportional to the real volatility of the Nouns meme and the degree of 'moneyness' of the exit price. Thus, the treasury tends logarithmically towards 0, and the value of the put becomes progressively more marginal (though never 0). In this way, exit ultimately is self-invalidating under v3. More aligned buyers will trickle in, with exit & the treasury correspondingly neutered.  \n\nNouns = (almost) pure meme.\n \nProblem (almost) solved. \n\nStill, the  fat-tail utility of the exit remains as long as there is eth in the treasury, and as meme value contracts, the puts become relevant selling pressure once again, forcing the dao to accelerate spending to adjust for its increased exposure. As long as the treasury has non-zero value, the puts stay on the book. \n\nIt may seem like a subtle point &  one nobody is likely to stress much about. Sort of agree. What it means, though, is that forking pressure still lies in wait during market capitulation, adding addtl downside leverage to the meme itself (if forks are progressively delegitimizing, as i believe they are).  \n\nA separate conversation, but there is a case to be made that we would want to set ourselves up to be strong when the market is not, not thrown again into chaos with centralizing reversion as our only remedy.\n\nUnder v3, the treasury is a liability. burn it all"},{"support":1,"voter":"0x83fCFe8Ba2FEce9578F0BbaFeD4Ebf5E915045B9","numberOfVotes":19,"reason":"saving up the treasury in excess of the nft market cap leads to people bidding on the treasury instead of aligned membership. aligned membership is our most important resource because it is the primary driver of dao security, dao attention, and moving the project forward. given that aligned membership is currently blocked by the treasury (with no natural resolution in sight), i support upgrading the protocol to address the problem. thank you to wilson and verbs for the elegant solution"},{"support":1,"voter":"0xc2d4f2D86E9fF3415C7e0C3Ee44C8819D25Fe413","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":"FOR getting code audits, but I think that's only half the work that's needed to make sure The Burn (or any other) protocol change works as intended.

Also I believe it is inevitable that the treasury will dip below 1000 ETH someday, and auction prices will fall below 10 ETH. However, in the grand picture of things, neither auction prices nor treasury size should be important if nouners use treasury to sponsor projects close to their hearts or build their own nounish projects. The burn mechanism makes it clear that nouners should use the treasury. I wish more nouners did build something nounish in the last two years. For example, projects such as \"Free Glasses for Children,\" \"PropHouse,\" \"Nouns Esports,\" \"Nouns Running Club,\" \"Skate Parks,\" \"Global Pizza Party,\" and others underscore the power of collective effort, something that might be financially and practically daunting for a single person.\n\nThe real essence of nouns isn't about flipping NFTs.

Nouns Stories is seeking $1,795,000 to develop, produce and distribute over 50 Animated Nouns Shorts on a global scale with nine time Emmy-Award winners Stoopid Buddy Stoodios, along with 50 of the best animators in the world.\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SyIYuo7gp.png)\n\n[Nouns Short Shorts Trailer](https://youtu.be/QxrvHepTh38)\n\n## NOUNS: FRONT AND CENTER\n\nMost sources of financing for animated content are tied to networks that move at a snail’s pace and that are not considered artist friendly. This is where Nouns steps in to disrupt the system. We want to provide the proper funding to attract the world’s best animators, help them bring their ideas to life, and in so doing — put Nouns DAO on the map as the number one source for innovative, diverse storytelling in animation. \n\nNot only that, but by making Nouns DAO the seed funder we’re putting the Nouns IP (and the brand’s aesthetic) front and center on a series of innovative and hilarious shorts that are bound to get massive amounts of attention with animation fans all around the world. What better way to spread the Nounish vibes and garner some positive attention?\n\n## PERSON, PLACE & THING: 3 THEMATIC ROUNDS, 50 CREATORS, 1 YEAR\n\nOver the course of the next twelve months we’ll onboard 50 of the world’s most innovate animators to create engaging animated shorts featuring great characters, engaging storylines, and Nounish vibes. By expanding the run times and upping the budgets, we’ll give the animators the opportunity to produce even MORE engaging visuals and storylines!\n\nWe’ll roll out the animated shorts over three themed rounds. Other than requiring the films to feature Nouns characters or Noggles, we’ll encourage the animators to go absolutely wild with the best and funniest ideas: the ones that may not exist within the walled gardens of Hollywood. Because not every artist has the bandwidth to produce longer form shorts, we’ll keep the Short Shorts 15 second+ format for some of our creators. \n\nIn total the three themed rounds will feature:\n\n- 12 x 2-3 minute Shorts\n- 38 x 15-30 second Short Shorts\n- 3 original shorts by the team at Stoopid Buddy\n\n## 50 OF THE WORLD’S BEST\n\nWe’ll cast our net wide to onboard the best animators we can muster, and by allowing them the creative freedom to ***************do what they do***************, we believe we’ll get the very best out of them. Not only that, but many of these talented folks already have huge followings online which will further expose the Nouns DAO to their legions of fans when we go live with the shorts and the post them to their own socials.\n\n## 3 STOOPID SHORTS\n\nTo kick off each thematic round, Stoopid Buddy Stoodios will pour all of their Nouns-lovin’-energy (see: Rose Parade / forthcoming Nouns Documentary) into making something truly special for Nouns — a love letter in animation like only they can. They’ll tap their A-list Buddies to create and voice these fully original mini-movies, creating some hilarious cohesion to what promises to be a wildly eclectic program!\n\n## CC0 Heroes\n\nAs we did in the first Nouns Short Shorts Festival, we’ll encourage each animator to embrace Nounish culture by opting in to making their shorts CC0. While it won’t be required, opting into to CC0 will make their films eligible for some damn [fine awards](https://twitter.com/nouns_stories/status/1670029456688418818) and cash prizes!\n\n## OH YEAH…ONE MORE THING\n\nWe’ll be hosting a *Nountastic* IRL animation festival to premiere these amazing shorts, attracting Nounish animation fans from all over the world.   Why do this when we could just hide behind the safety of our computer monitors? Because as we experienced with the first screening at [Braindead Studios](https://studios.wearebraindead.com/) in Los Angeles (in conjunction with the Melbourne screening at Pixel), there’s an *energy* and *magic* to bringing communities together to share in a truly unique experience that will help put Nouns DAO on the map. We’ll invite all our industry pals, and will we live-stream the whole thing just as we did before? Abso-fucking-lutely!\n\n## IMPACT: NETWORK EFFECT\n\nThe first round of shorts garnered over **a million views** in the first month of release across creator and owned social channels. Most of these views were native to the creator channels of the animators themselves — providing a whole new audience for Nouns. This time around, we’ll not only continue to seek out animators with their own audiences, but amplify views across all platforms with a social media marketing campaign and enlisting a PR firm to bolster [awareness](https://www.animationmagazine.net/2023/07/stoopid-buddy-stoodios-chris-waters-unzips-about-the-nouns-short-shorts-festival/) of what we’re up to. On top of this, to build anticipation and excitment for the festival as the year unfolds, we'll create original promotional content, including teasers and trailers, behind the scenes footage, and creator profiles.\nCheck out some of the postings from our first Shorts Shorts Festival below!\n\n[![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/Hy2i70Kxa.jpg)](https://www.instagram.com/reel/Ctm_qiRBIre/)\n[![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/By3o7AtxT.jpg)](https://www.instagram.com/p/CttDyBBo33G/)\n[![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/S13oQ0Yxp.jpg)](https://www.instagram.com/reel/CtgbaWPJ9iK/)\n\n\n## THE NOUNS STORIES TEAM\n\n**Stoopid Buddy Stoodios**\n\n9 time Emmy-winning studio behind *Robot Chicken,* and producer of over 1,000 hours of animated television **including: *Crossing Swords, Mickey Saves Christmas, and Marvel’s MODOK.* Stoopid Buddy is a pioneering independent studio that has helped drive the tremendous growth in adult animation over the past decade.

Not only will we be identifying top-tier talent from our own networks of creators, but we’ll also be recruiting on a global scale to identify and onboard the next generation of up-and-coming animation talent.\n\nWe’ll be managing and coordinating a massive effort to create decentralized content and creatively package it in a way that connects with audiences around the globe. Not only that, but we’ll be tapping our extensive network to best position our exposure and distribution of the program online, at festivals, and beyond. We’ll be coordinating a social media / marketing and PR strategy, as well as presenting “behind the scenes” access and status updates to the DAO as this undertaking fully develops.\n\n## BEYOND THE PROP\n\nThe Nouns Stories team has over 613,620ish hours of experience in animation development, production, marketing, distribution and sales. Our team is well positioned to take these Nounish creations beyond what is promised in the proposal. Our hope is we can continue to develop the best-of-the-best beyond their existence as a short, and seed Nounish content and characters into the mainstream zeitgeist. Think about it — *The Simpsons*, *South Park*, *Rick & Morty*, and hell, even *Robot Chicken*, all got their start **********as animated shorts.**********\n\n## THAT’S A WRAP!\n\nAnimation drives cultural conversation. There’s a white space in animation that Nouns DAO is uniquely positioned to fill. Nimble development. Artist friendly. Global reach. We believe there’s a more “Nounish” way to produce the next great animated shorts, and that we have the team to help find them and make them. \n\nFor Nouns, there’s an opportunity to be front-and-center in one of the most passionate arenas in pop culture and create break-out successes that proliferate the meme.\n\nOur team has poured our hearts and souls into the Nouns experiment since it’s inception, and we’ve proven we can develop world-class animation and execute on ambitious ideas. We believe in a new way of generating content and organizing passionate communities of creators and fans. Together we can change the culture and build Nouns DAO into the next great destination for animation, so slap on your dang Noggles and let’s do this!!\n\n## BUDGET BREAKDOWN\n\n**TOTAL: $1,795,000 USDC** \n50% distributed upon commencement, 50% upon completion of first round.\n\n**Animation** **************Content - $1,270,000**************\n\n- 12 x 2-3 min shorts (3 rounds, 4 per round, $20k/short) - $240K\n- 38 x 15-30 sec Short Shorts (3 rounds, 12 to 13 shorts per round, $7.5k/short) - $285K\n- Three Original Shorts + packaging from Stoopid Buddy - $450K\n- Nounish Trailers / Behind-the-Scenes / Festival Recap Docs / Creator Profiles - $150K\n- “CC0 Hero” Awards (3 rounds, 15K per round) - $45K\n- Animation Festival - $100K\n\n**Management and Production - $430K** \n\n- Exec Producer Fees - $300K\n    - artist outreach and curation\n    - creative oversight and curation\n    - promotion\n- Producer - $100K\n    - Animator management\n    - Scheduling, Accounting and Deliverables\n- Web build and upkeep - $30K\n\n************************************General Operations - $95K************************************\n\n- Publicist - $15K\n- Social Media Mgr - $15K\n- Legal+Accounting - $20K\n- Event Planner - $20K\n- Team Travel & Accommodation - allow $25K","proposer":"0x7549DCAad7d31af14DD8a4ADF7cF8241D04Fa91c","startBlock":18315733,"endBlock":18344533,"executed":true},"votes":[{"support":1,"voter":"0xa903C06BF35286f6d1cDAD25396748353979a44C","numberOfVotes":0,"reason":"A very big and bold ask.

I love the idea of 'earning' a Noun, and since (at the present moment) there is no defined way to do that, I decided to build it into the prop itself as a way to indicate that interest. \n\n**This 'earning' is not, however, a transaction in the current prop** but will instead be in a future prop that allows Nouners to vote on whether a Noun is **deserved or not** once everyone has seen the epically awesome results!\n\n#### **The Story** \nSome of you also wanted to hear a little bit more about the story these images would be capturing and I'm more than happy to oblige because for me, it's the characters, story and nounish themes that are the most exciting things about getting to execute 'Noun en Scène'. \n\nI see the Nouns as little, innocent agents of change, who are chock-full of optimism and doing their best - pulled and directed by their noggles - to go around and help people, even if they have no freakin' idea how! They might screw up, they might not know what they're doing, but that's never going to stop them from trying their gosh darn hardest to do some good! \n\nAnd to explore these ideas, I did a fun jam session working on a series document and a pilot 'scriptment' (*neither are finished or definitive, but a step in the creative discovery process that gives me a jumping off point as we continue to develop character, story and themes*) for the nounish show, 'G◨-◨D INTENTIONS', that doesn't exist, but whose episodes 'Noun en Scène' will capture cinematic stills from, making it seem like this nounish 'Muppet' show IS a real thing: *[WORKING SERIES DOCUMENT](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sNWmF0Lhlqe7bRMHra9EKHyoLSPr3B1CDIwSJJw8sTs/edit?usp=sharing)*\n\n#### **Distribution Clarification** \nThe main goal of this project is to get these images out into the world so that people can see them and get curious about Nouns. And I think putting these kind of high-quality, cinematic images in places where NFTs are not often seen (specifically billboards but  also super large format at a gallery show) will allow them to function as both **quirky advertisments for Nouns and high quality art pieces that connect with people outside of this space**. \n\nThere is not, however, an ask for funds for the billboards or gallery rentals in this prop because I intend to do a **Droposal** afterwards where all of the NFT sales revenue goes towards this exact distribution effort (Yitong, let's talk!). **Digital funding physical!**\n\nAs mentioned in the prop, we will also be documenting the process of the creation of these images, so I foresee quite a lot of BTS content that is going to be going up through Zora and socials (maybe we could even do a **Nounish vid about it??**).\n\n#### And finally, **Project Clarification** \nI could've used this prop to ask for development funds for a script and storyboards and gone a more traditional route, but **I think that the deliverables coming out of this being able to live as a **finished photography series/art project** unto itself is far more exciting!** \n\nThis doesn't mean that I want the project to end or plan to end it after this prop's deliverables - *I mean, c'mon, we're going to have two incredible Noun 'Muppets' to create with!* - simply that **utilizing funds to execute high-quality, finished images that we can use to make people Noun-curious in IRL spaces right away** is far better than having *only* developed material with the *intention* to do more. \n\nWe want to deliver something final AND ALSO intend to do more :) \n\n\n### **And with that...** \n**Please find the sturdy bones of the previous prop with these updates incorporated below** 👇\n\n---\n# **TL;DR**\n\n**Cinematic stills from a television series that doesn't exist (yet!) starring Chip - a cookie Noun - and Benny - a rabbit Noun- in the surreal, funny and over-the-top adventures they find themselves on while trying to do good in the world.**\n\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BJ1-5UUsh.png)\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/r17M9IIs2.png)\n\n\n# **TELL YOU MORE ABOUT THE PROJECT?

I mean look at that Roger Rabbit still. What are Roger and Eddie looking at? What’s about to happen? And why are they handcuffed together?! Not to mention location, costumes, use of lighting or even the colors! There’s a palpable tension and curiosity in that single frame that makes us **care**. \n\nI want to bring that to a fun art project focused on a pair of Nouns - Chip and Benny - and their adventures in the - slightly (or sometimes *very*) heightened and over-the-top - world of ‘**Noun en Scène**’.\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rJmaYfou3.png)\n\nThink of it as a cinematic one-shot storytelling project that takes our pixelated, digital little Nouns, turns them into real life ‘muppet’-like puppets and then throws them into film scenes with flesh and blood people.\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rkwdXQiu3.jpg)\n(*cinematic scenes that make you ask questions and keep looking*)\n\nEvery one-shot tosses our sweet, little Nouns into a new dramatic scene where they're forced to deal with the crazy situation they've gotten themselves into by trying to help or do a good deed for a random human they've met. \n\nAnd through these scenic moments, the world of Chip, Benny and the 'Noun en Scène' project will grow, evolve and hopefully become something people want to see more of!\n\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rJMTUmid2.jpg)\n\nBy utilizing ‘Muppet’-like characters mixed with real people and heightened, cinematically-lit scenes, the absurdity and beauty of life will become that much more stark, profound and hopefully very funny. \n\nTaking cues and paying homage to a variety of influences including Alex Prager, The Far Side, world cinema, the Kermitage Collection and many more, this project aims to utilize a couple Nouns to create captivating characters we just can’t get enough of. \n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/S1_riGoO3.jpg)\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/B1dHszjOn.jpg)\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HkX_jzi_h.jpg)\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/S1CuBtIjh.jpg)\n\n\nChip and Benny are just a couple innocent, little guys trying to help and do good in the world, but instead they keep finding themselves entangled in situations way beyond their depth. \n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BJCRRGj_3.jpg)\n\n# **COOL. SO WHAT’S THE PLAN?**\n\nThese shoots will be treated like an indie film production - the difference being that we are capturing **single shots** that tell full, rich stories while still requiring casting, makeup, lighting, location scouting/rentals, puppet styling etc. \n\nOn the casting front, while at first it will make sense to work with local working actors/models and friends, as the project gains traction and grows - or when I’m working on my next tv show - I think there is a fun way to bring known name actors into these scenes and add a whole other level of playfulness to the project. \n\nThe first step will be designing, modeling and manufacturing our Noun ‘muppets.’ **Luckily, I’ve gotten a very exciting collaborator on board for this!**\n\n# **PUPPET HEAP!**\n[![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SJrVNiKx6.png)](https://youtu.be/agxY_pJwo8o?feature=shared)\n\n\n**Puppet Heap** is a unique design and production studio specializing in storytelling through the creation of iconic characters for all sorts of media including film, television, advertising, theater, and new media. The company was founded by artist, designer, filmmaker, and teacher Paul Andrejco after observing the burgeoning pile of puppets that had accumulated in his Hoboken apartment back in the early ‘90s. Now, just a few blocks away, Puppet Heap is home to teams of artists, designers, writers, and producers creating character based narratives for clients around the world including **The Walt Disney Company, Sesame Workshop, and Nickelodeon**. Puppet Heap has been entrusted with the care, maintenance, and creative support of the Muppets for Disney’s **The Muppets Studio** since 2006.\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HyX40MsOh.jpg)\n(*Puppet Heap team on set of Imagine Dragon's 'Radioactive'*)\n\nPuppet Heap loves the project - *I nounspilled them* - and will be joining to design and create the physical puppets of Chip and Benny. And as scale and scope continue to evolve in their journey (we have big plans), they’ll be there, helping to tell their growing story - and all the other Nouns that come into play too.\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BJXG1rDp2.jpg)\n\n# **AWESOME! AND WHAT ABOUT ME?**\n\nMy name is Chris Martin - not of Coldplay, sorry - and I’ve been making independent, global film and television productions for a decade plus now - primarily in Korea.\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HklvCzid2.jpg)\n\nMost recently, I co-created, co-wrote, directed, showran,and EP’ed 20 episodes of a show called 'Dramaworld' currently streaming on Amazon that stars well-known actors including Liv Hewson (‘Yellowjackets’, ‘Santa Clarita Diet’), Brett Gray (‘I’m a Virgo’, ‘On My Block’), Daniel Dae Kim (‘Lost’, ‘Hawaii 5-0’), Ha Jiwon (‘Secret Garden’) and K-pop star Henry Lau.\n\n[![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/ryG2-7jun.jpg)](https://www.amazon.com/Dramaworld-2/dp/B09QWZ45Y1)\n\nWith everything I create, I try to lean into **a playful, magical realist tone that’s grounded in heart**, which is the kind of storytelling that I think is not only a perfect fit for Nouns, but also an incredible way to bring people into this journey of Chip and Benny as they go around trying to help.\n\n\n\nI love everything about Nouns - the ethos, the support for creative, weird projects, and did I mention the freakin’ Noggles?! - and have been trying to figure out how I could do something creative that furthered that mission for quite awhile now. \n\nThen suddenly, while wandering around a street festival the other day, I saw this:\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HkmKCfj_3.jpg)\n\n**And bingo! 💡**\n\nThe idea for ‘Noun en Scène’ landed fully formed in my brain! And I knew I had to make it a reality and see what it could eventually become!\n\n# **WHY SHOULD NOUNS FUND THIS?**\n\nStorytelling is everything - always has been. And in a world where we are inundated with ‘content’ online, a playful, quirky and precise project like this will be a breath of fresh air to stand out against the noise.\n\nUtilizing photography as a medium and consistent characters as the subject will allow fans to come back, excited to see where the journey of Chip and Benny will lead and who they'll be trying to 'help' next. \n\nAnd by staging everything down to the last detail, each photographic story that comes out of ‘Noun en Scène’ will simultaneously be a fine art piece, a Sunday (web)comic and continuous character development leading to a broader (and very Noun-curious) audience. \n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/r12QW7iuh.jpg)\n\nAnd in the spirit of '**mint everything**,' we are planning to utilize Zora to **mint and document our progress** - design sketches, scripts, behind the scenes, etc. It feels like a great way to document the process of creation and build something creative in public. \n\n# **Speaking of creative, meet Benny!**\nHere's Paul's initial design for Benny:\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/H1YB-Han3.jpg)\n\nArms and legs, oh my! With our puppets, we want to keep what makes Nouns distinct while adding a whole new flavor that brings them to life and gives them character. \n\n### **The (mis)adventures of Chip and Benny** \nBy creating empathy and connection with our two little Nouns through **visual storytelling**, the project will help spread Nouns and nounish-ness far and wide - just how Chip and Benny would want it. \n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SJIwS910n.jpg)\n(*One-shot example sketch - 'Chip and Benny Check for- AHHHHH!'*)\n\nAnd we plan to have this first leg of the project culminate in a **fun droposal** that takes Chip and Benny IRL in eye-catching ways (*see below for a tease*). \n\n# **THE ASK AKA THE BUDGET**\n\nWe want to propose a tight, but realistic budget that still allows us to execute this at the highest professional standards, so that we can first not only prove the concept, but create something that rivals the quality of anything you'd see in a high budget studio release. \n\nWe want to go above and beyond everyone’s expectations for what 'Noun en Scène' can be because seeing is believing and we think this initial batch of scenes will prove the potential of building out characters in a uniquely nounish way and make people want to see where we can go with Chip and Benny in the future. \n\n**BUDGET:**\n* **$40,000 USDC (2 puppets x $20,000 USDC/puppet)** **one-time cost** for the design and fabrication of our ‘Noun Muppets’ - this allows Puppet Heap to design, costume and build out Chip and Benny in their physical ‘muppet’-ish forms (**to be used again and again as the project continues and evolves**).\n* **$50,000 USDC** production budget to shoot and finish (at least) 5 'one-shots' - this will be a fully crewed up shoot with actors, set design, hair & makeup etc. and the budget will be used to pay crew, rent equipment, secure locations, finish photos in post etc. (all the production related expenses)\n* **Detailed breakdown** to give a general idea of how the funds will be used **[HERE](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1yym2vm-ojk9sXjrwziRHCDY6VYrSZPva3XBaryZLFUY/edit?usp=sharing)**\n* **Potentially 1 Noun** - If the results are of a quality that Nouners think warrants it, I ask that **another prop be put up to vote on whether a Noun (Noun 483, cookie head Noun from the treasury) has been 'earned' and can be sent as a reward**. A big part of why I'm doing this is be able to participate more fully and help provide a voice to shape the Nouns ecosystem going forward and I believe becoming a Noun holder is the next step to that!\n\n**TOTAL BUDGET: $90,000 USDC + Potentially 1 NOUN (tbd by future proposal)**\n\n**PAYMENT ADDRESS:**\nnoun-en-scene.eth\n0x6Ccb83c907dBf0B4bc28f9BF83173b0ab943350B\n\n# **TIMELINE**\n\nUpon prop passing, we can make our puppets and be in production in approximately **2.5 months** and aiming to have finished images ready **~1 month later**.\n\nAll the while **minting our progress and creative developments** on Zora.\n\n# **FUTURE STEPS**\n\nMy aim is to use the project to develop the characters and story of these two best friends on their journey to help and do good - even if it always seems to go a little sideways - in a surprising novel and onchain way. 'Noun en Scène' as the first piece will allow us to capture cinematic moments that bring Nouns into the real(ish) world and, hopefully, helps people fall in love with Chip, Benny and their continued adventures.\n\nWhich brings me back to the aforementioned droposal! \n\nWhat better way to take this project out into the world than through a **Droposal whose sales revenue will 100% go to getting these images up onto billboards and putting together a gallery show of a select number of physicals.** \n\nMore on both those soon! \n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BJFGYFIi3.jpg)\n(⌐◨-◨'s *on billboards?*)\n\n\nPaul and I have a ton of fun ideas for where to take this and how to grow it, so we're looking forward to what we can achieve this go round while keeping our minds open to how it can be expanded!\n\nThank you for taking the time to read and look forward to making the world a little more nounish!\n\n**Time for Chip, Benny and their friends to save the world.

We want to set up a Prop House to fund public goods projects and artworks within the GLITCH collective and beyond, where the highest-ranked artworks will be submitted as a Droposal for Nouns.\n\n**Total funds requested: 25 ETH**\n* 10 ETH for the GLITCH residency (see below for more granular budget)\n* 15 ETH for the Prop House Treasury\n\n![GLITCH Community](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=126XxNSe_cLiVf0vE7tPmRHelc9c28-dg)\n\n# GLITCH 3.0\nThe GLITCH art collective is organising the third edition of its art residency. It’s a 2 weeks long event gathering blockchain / AI artists and engineers, collaborating on the creation of new NFT collections inspired by the notion of CC-0 and Remix. GLITCH is a unique opportunity to build new types of public goods, past editions have led to the creation of several protocols (e.g. REMIX NFT, IMPACT NFT) as well as an open source NFT Token-Bound Licensing standard to embed Creative Commons-like licensing conditions directly into NFTs.\n\n## ART RESIDENCY\nGLITCH is a two-week focused residency at an 18th century chateau in France. About 40-50 participants will be invited to create, imagine, develop theories, build projects and standards aimed at supporting a new creative ecosystem of open creativity and digital abundance in the blockchain art world.  The participants will be a highly curated group of creative and smart individuals actively engaged with NFTs, art, music and AI. The goal is to bring the right people, in the right place, at the right time, and then let the magic happen.\n\nAt GLITCH, we strive to empower people with ideas, visions, and expertise, while providing space for our attendees to reach deep into their minds and forge better models together. We exist to disrupt the status quo and to manifest positive solutions for society.\nThe outcomes of the residency will be, first and foremost, a tight community of value-aligned people eager to collaborate with one another, new collaborations and synergies in order to shape the world of tomorrow. The residency will also promote a variety of new initiatives about how to promote the value of openness and interoperability in the blockchain art world. Expected deliverables include new NFT protocols that encourage remix and creativity, new NFT protocols geared towards maximization of social and environmental impact, as well as a variety of collaborative exhibitions for NFT artists. All content produced within the residency will be released and made available to all under Creative Commons licenses.\n\nMore details about the third edition of GLITCH can be found at the [following link](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1xWfm3HfZJHDdlb8-7bhrVE4fWmNJDOhd)\n\n![GLITCH overview](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1EHB6ZJxOhGZOb1wWWz1YobCez6UViYop)\n\n# GLITCH Prop House & Droposal\n\nGLITCH is an avant-garde hub for blockchain art and innovation. We aim to utilize Prop House's pioneering mechanism to fund the creation of artworks and public goods that will be stewarded and/or mentored by the members of the GLITCH collective (artists, engineers, curators, etc). By harnessing Prop House's governance system, we aim to democratize the funding process, foster cross-pollination between the Nouns and GLITCH community, and support projects that contribute significantly to the blockchain art ecosystem.\n\n## GLITCH Prop House\n\nGLITCH will create a Prop House round for blockchain artists and engineers to propose artworks and public goods to be created during the GLITCH residency. Artworks can range from NFTs to physical installations; public good initiatives can range from developing open standard or open-source tools, organizing educational events, or supporting initiatives to promote the blockchain art space. Collaboration between artists, technologists, and other stakeholders will be strongly encouraged, leading to the creation of groundbreaking initiatives in the blockchain art world, and beyond.\n\nAnyone can submit a proposal for a new artwork or public good and request a maximum of 3 ETH. The GLITCH and Nouns community members assess the proposals and vote to allocate funds to the initiatives that align with GLITCH's mission of openness, collaboration, and innovation. Votes can be cast both by Nouns holders and GLITCH-NFT holders (we will distribute a GLITCH-NFT to all current and previous GLITCH participants, around 90 people total). Nouns and GLITCH-NFTs have an equal weight of one vote. We want Nouns holders to have a say on the selection of the proposed projects so that we can get feedback from outside of the event, to ensure that the projects that are funded are relevant not only to the GLITCH community, but also to other communities across the Nouns and NFT space.\n\n## GLITCH DROPOSAL\n\nThe successful proposals, if applicable (i.e. to the extent that they include the production of a digital artwork), will be proposed as a Droposal for Nouns. The proceeds from the Droposal will be split equally between Nouns DAO, GLITCH and the creator(s) of the artwork.\n\n![GLITCH people](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1LWgWO67u5aDXgF7vP5rQej8bkIDPJL1M)\n\n# FUNDINGS\n\nThe full costs of the residency is **$60,000** (inclusive of accommodation and catering for all participants). We are requesting **10 ETH** to cover 1/4 of the costs. \n\nThe Prop House will fund proposals for up to **3 ETH per proposal**. We need **15 ETH** to support at least 5 proposals.\n\n\nWe are requesting a total grant of **25 ETH** in order to implement this proposal:\n* **10 ETH**: support of the GLITCH residency\n* **15 ETH**: Prop House treasury\n\n# TEAM\nThe GLITCH collective is stewarded by [Primavera De Filippi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primavera_De_Filippi), [Will Papper](https://www.linkedin.com/in/wpapper/), [Isaac Patka](https://www.linkedin.com/in/isaac-patka-417b4328/) and many other amazing blockchain artists and engineers !\n\n\n\n\n","proposer":"0x7e6ce11beE2AB7F84eF0D1955CE1F546D897aB98","startBlock":18318851,"endBlock":18347651,"executed":true},"votes":[{"support":1,"voter":"0xC9A43964B791e5aBd13B98fAc710132AbFCa873E","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":"looks good"},{"support":1,"voter":"0xA86882277E69FbF0a51805cdc8b0a3a113079E63","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":"For (reason in candidate signal)"},{"support":1,"voter":"0x1db19B9903c5510AA5a866ea643Eb021CD12Bda0","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":"interesting"},{"support":1,"voter":"0x2666f0C8FB58d182f2Dd79475DCA4A07B3724607","numberOfVotes":3,"reason":"I like the proposal, but would also like some specific nounish outcomes.

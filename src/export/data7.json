It can be said that Web3 has not yet penetrated the general public. Naturally, even fewer people know about nouns.\n\nHowever, due to the growth of the blockchain field and the fact that nouns and Noggles are IPs using CC0We imagine that nouns and Noggles will gradually penetrate the market and become a commonplace part of society in the future.\nThis is the timeline we are aiming for and realizing, we believe that participating in the Web3 Conference is very meaningful.\n\n\n## Concept\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**“ Mirai ” means Future.**\n\n\n〜The future of nouns and noggles in Japan.  \n　　　　　　　　　　　　　　A place to showcase such a future, one step ahead〜\n\n\n![田川さんのコンセプトアート](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=17MZIZqPcUGiz_xfOsM7sJg34HF0VqjsG)\n\n**Key visual　”Pop Pop Tokyo”**\n\n\n*PROLOGUE*\n*Nounsdao is a new organization called dao, built by web3 technology, with the philosophy of making the world more enjoyable through character and art.*\n\n*The activities of dao are helping to integrate nouns among people around the world and create the beloved Mirai.

We will introduce the future of the fusion of nouns and Japan to visitors using the spirit of harmony (exhibition), art (live painting), and metaverse (technology).\n\n\n## Key Points\n\nNouns characters and Noggles will blend naturally with Tatami mats and Japanese culture, showing the futuristic fun of mixed culture.\n\nWe will set up a unique and different Japanese-style room in the business conference space to provide visitors with the experience of taking off their shoes and sitting on tatami mats.\n\nIn the Tatami room, noggle type VR glasses will be provided. Each guest will be guided to Nouns street in Co-Mati, a Japanese-style space in the Metaverse Spatial space, using their own smartphone. Various real and virtual hospitality related to Nouns will be offered here.\n\n\n\n## “Noren” and “Tea room” that invite you to Mirai\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n![茶室と暖簾の絵](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1-lnd16j4m-dZbNEcswOCfmM7yhktCRgn)\n\n\n〜The spirit of Japanese hospitality \"Teahouse\" and the sense of anticipation after passing through the \"noren\" curtain.This \"tearoom\" is used as a \"portal\" to connect to Nouns' Mirai = \"Future\".\n\nJapanese hospitality is based on the spirit of \"tea ceremony,\" a form of hospitality that is appropriate to not be pretentious\nThe \"noren\" (traditional Japanese curtains) hanging in front of stores in Japan are not only used as signboards, but are also used to show the store's credibility and pride. Such a uniquely Japanese interior is expressed in a small space of 3m✖️3m.\n\nVisitors pass through the noren (curtain) and are invited to enter a small but isolated Japanese space with tatami mats. In this small space, we commissioned a master craftsman and a noren workshop to create a small Japanese room that can be incorporated into modern life, creating an interior that makes the most of the small space.\n\n\n\n## Live Painting -Drawing Mirai on a pure white campus\n---\n\n\n![田川さんの制作写真](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1RbpKX_psTCrz5T4Qy-_B3-SolAl5fpIV)\n\n\n[🔗Live painting activity video by Mr. Tagawa](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xU1USuJtVLU) \n\n\n\nAt the booth, a live painting event will be held, where Makoto Tagawa, a painter, will create a key visual of NounsMiraiJAPAN from scratch on a pure white wall of 2.7m✖️3.0m. What kind of work (future) will it be? Might it be different from the \"PopPopTokyo\" work shown at the beginning of the exhibition?

We garnered [record support from the DAO](https://lilnouns.proplot.wtf/idea/529), as well as valuable feedback from many members that helped improve our prop. We look forward to supporting the Lils and being part of the community!_\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n\n## TL;DR:\n\n* We are proposing to use our Matr Labs robotics to fabricate 1,001 Nouns on-demand from #0 to #1,000. Artmatr will develop custom software and hardware to pull off this feat, including an exclusive airdropped physical redemption token, MATRing portal with algorithmic and AI creative control, cutting edge tool development, and the extensive code development required to tie it all together. All Noun holders will have the right to customize and claim their respective physical copy(s).  \n* All shipping and handling costs to deliver the physical work to community members will be covered by Artmatr. We will create or employ a shipping system that ensures anonymity of any address information needed.\n* Complementary digital content, including timelapse videos and high-resolution photography, will be available to Nouns holders and the community, and the airdropped redemption tokens will update to display the MATRed Nouns upon completion.\n* We will produce a massive Nouniversary event at Artmatr’s gallery, showcasing some of the first MATRed Nouns with live MATRing throughout the day.\n* This project will add a significant amount of new value to existing Nouns mints, as well as upcoming auctions. The content created by each Noun’s MATRing process will be widely distributed and shared, elevating visibility of the innovative ways Nouns can be works of art IRL, and the Nouniversary will be an opportunity to showcase that! We will also allocate any secondary royalties of the Matr Labs x Nouns token to the Nouns treasury.\n[![UIUX-GIF-1.gif](https://i.postimg.cc/SRSqsxjZ/UIUX-GIF-1.gif)](https://postimg.cc/62mFbwrR)\n\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n\n## Overview\n\nOur [last prop](https://nouns.wtf/vote/224) allowed Artmatr the opportunity to develop and create seven unique paintings of Nouns over the course of one week in March. Each day’s minted Noun was interpreted by our team of artists and engineers and “MATRed” on the same day as a 48” x 48” oil painting with our custom robotic hardware and code. The winner of each auction was given the rights to the corresponding painting. We celebrated the week of Nouns art with a successful public exhibition and VIP opening in our Brooklyn gallery, attended by major artists, gallerists, and auctioneers from the New York art scene.\n\nWe’re excited to follow up on the success of Prop 224 with a massive endeavor to bring physical art to every Nouner in the world. With the help of the Nouns community’s creative input, we propose to MATR 1,001 Nouns and distribute them globally to their respective holders. [Each Noun-holding wallet will be airdropped a Matr Labs token that can be redeemed for a physical. ](https://vimeo.com/830696167)We will update the metadata of the token upon redemption with a hi-res image of the Matr’d Noun, which will provide a digital Certificate of Authenticity for each physical piece of art. Supporting this huge development and production effort, we will deploy curated content across a variety of social channels, raising visibility of Nouns DAO and the ways Nouns create value and delight for the both broader Web3 community as well as the community of artists and art collectors that we are fostering.\n\nThis project aims to return on investment to the Nouns DAO in as many ways as possible, through high-quality content, marketing, and sponsorship visibility. We will publicly celebrate this endeavor with a huge launch party and exhibition near the August 8th Nouniversary and we will continue to promote this effort through dedicated social channels throughout the rest of the year and into 2024. We also propose that one of our cutting-edge MATR Labs machine racks gets built with custom Nouns sponsorship visibility, so that Noggles and Nouns branding can be seen in the content generated by every piece of art created on the machine. \n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n\n## Recap\n[![image6.png](https://i.postimg.cc/B6wL4HwZ/image6.png)](https://postimg.cc/njBc1jJN)\n\nProp 224 passed on February 13, 2023, to a resounding yes vote of 151 to 17. We immediately began developing ways we could use our custom robots and software to create a unique oil painting for each Noun over the prescribed week. We developed a number of stylistic directions that required new tools and hours of code development. Ultimately, we created paintings with unique robotically-created textures in the oil paint that brought dimensionality and life to Nouns, and embedded the mint hash into the paintings as well.\n\n[![image9.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/NF9yMFW6/image9.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/4HG42f4y)\n\nWe wrote thousands of lines of code to reinterpret the digital images as paintings, honed the tooling, mixed the paint, and arranged the cameras. As proposed, we completed a unique painting of that day’s Noun, on time, and live streamed the entire process, as well as a 3D scan of each finished work for our virtual gallery. The project pushed our technical limits to the edge and allowed us to try new creative techniques that have greatly improved our art-making processes as a whole.\n\n[![image17.png](https://i.postimg.cc/q71gx2rc/image17.png)](https://postimg.cc/Nyrgg95L)\n\nDuring production time our Twitter and Instagram feeds were full of Nouns as our content and marketing team came up with new and creative ways to showcase the community through the paintings. The project generated great buzz from the community, and generated auction prices above the previous 30-day average, including a 36.69 ETH sale on the genesis painting. The week was capped off with a successful [first-ever exhibition in the Artmatr space in Brooklyn](https://vimeo.com/829178232). The works have been seen and talked about by major collectors, artists, galleries and auction houses, including Christie’s, Pace, Pioneer Works, and many other VIP’s in the crypto and traditional art communities. \n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n[![image3.png](https://i.postimg.cc/mrBFwbH4/image3.png)](https://postimg.cc/87X5kg4X)\n[![image11.png](https://i.postimg.cc/QtPtRsHH/image11.png)](https://postimg.cc/TLVfDzj6)\n[![image18.png](https://i.postimg.cc/wMmvzPmF/image18.png)](https://postimg.cc/RJv9QgGn)\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\nSince the passing and success of our last Prop, Artmatr has grown significantly. We’ve scaled up, adding seasoned Project, Operations, and Product Managers, as well as building a dedicated 3 person marketing team. Our engineering team has also expanded, driving our hardware and software development at breakneck speeds. We held an exhibition opening with Zancan at our Brooklyn gallery space that 500 people attended, and other art from the Artmatr lab has been shown at Pace Gallery and Unit London, among other established galleries worldwide. Our Twitter following has more than doubled, and we engage with a diverse and growing audience across our popular Tik Tok, Instagram, Twitch, and Discord channels. Our organic reach has been very strong, maintaining an impressive 10.5% average engagement rate, with over 400k impressions in the period following the original Prop.\n\nWe learned specific lessons from the execution of our first proposal. The most important thing is that we want to prioritize total community engagement, both the whole Nouns community and our growing Web3-curious traditional art world community. By scaling down the final pieces and allowing anyone to MATR a Noun using a redemption token, we think this project will have a much broader impact. We also want to stress the effort that we plan to put into this project to raise visibility of the Nouns DAO through our social channels. We see each MATRed piece as an opportunity to spread the word about the creativity of the community and promote the brand, and our automated cameras will capture and produce a timelapse video of the MATRing process of each created work. We will also explore collaborative Nouns MATRing with our community of blue-chip artists.\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n\n## New Prop\n[![Untitled.png](https://i.postimg.cc/2SDp85Jn/Untitled.png)](https://postimg.cc/nC0S3nnL)\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\nOur new Matr Labs platform consisting of newly developed art-making software and scaled down versions of our large machines will incorporate technology distilled from our experiences with the likes of Tyler Hobbs, Zancan and other brilliant artists we work with. The technology is entering a production-ready state from an initial prototype, and we want the Nouns community to work with us as we continue to develop and scale. We are committed to pushing the envelope of technological creativity, and with the assistance of Nouns DAO, we will help define the bridge between digital and physical artwork for a future generation of artists. \n\n[![image16.png](https://i.postimg.cc/Z0zq5cPm/image16.png)](https://postimg.cc/D45hC1Yp)\n\nWe would like to propose that every Noun holder from #0 to #1000 will have the opportunity to use our new platform and generate a unique 18” x 18” unique physical rendition of a Noun (their own, another from the collection, or a new noun from the Playground). Each MATRed Noun will be shipped to the holder at no additional cost, worldwide. \n\n[![image12.png](https://i.postimg.cc/MHCnjxSh/image12.png)](https://postimg.cc/ctcxVp6m)\n\n_User flow: User starts by connecting their wallet & choosing their Noun on the server > Personalizes the Noun > server generated a preview with the translation layer > users has three choices: Modify the artwork, Save the preview for consideration or send to MATR > during the MATRing process, the work is captured in high res and when the MATR process is finished, the work is minted and shipped._\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\nThe key to MATRing a physical Noun will be the 1,0001 redemption tokens, which will be airdropped to all wallets holding Nouns and will continue to be distributed as new Nouns are minted and won - up to #1,000. In the spirit of Noun’s CC0 license, a redemption token holder will be able to use any Noun in the collection as inspiration for their physical. The tokens can also be traded in the event that a holder does not want a physical, and royalties will be sent to the treasury.\n\n[![](https://i.postimg.cc/PxwJnx90/Group-10.png)](https://vimeo.com/830696167)\n\nThe physical pieces created by the Nouns community and anyone outside who acquires a redemption token will generate increased visibility and value to the DAO, as existing holders and new auction winners alike will be given the opportunity to create a physical representation of their Noun with their own creative input. This creates both physical permanence for the Nouns in the world, as well as the possibility for virality for every related social media post that is shared. Additionally, we will also brand our newly-produced robot with Nouns branding, elevating Nouns visibility alongside the growth of this initiative. This machine will get heavy use, with time lapses and photos being core to the creation process, so the Nouns will be visually associated with the works created by incredible artists using the same tech.\n\n[![image4.png](https://i.postimg.cc/qvdtJkQK/image4.png)](https://postimg.cc/VdDs4Pxs)\n*_Concept of Nouns Sponsored Matr Labs Rack_*\n\nHaving the Nouns community with us will give us the freedom to come up with exciting new ways to implement our technology that we may not otherwise have been able to do when operating within the constraints of an individual artist. We want to continue pushing the boundaries of our technology in order to make art that excites both the Nouns community and our community at-large.\n[![image13.gif](https://i.postimg.cc/k4DG1DM0/image13.gif)](https://postimg.cc/mzfThLHj)\nWe are eager to develop and employ our new tech at the epic scale that it was built for. We went big with this project, and want the community to feel that their money is well spent. It is easy to quantify the project on a per-print cost basis, but do keep in mind that we are also committing to a constant stream of content, marketing, and PR on behalf of the Nouns DAO, an epic NYC event as part of the Nouniversary celebrations, and development of a new Matr Labs robot that will be Nouns sponsored and branded. We feel that these intangibles will bring a lot of value and visibility to the community, while allowing us the opportunity to build the tech to its full potential in a shortened period of  time. \n[![image10.png](https://i.postimg.cc/GmJ49ZS5/image10.png)](https://postimg.cc/MnH6Frw7)\n[![image14.png](https://i.postimg.cc/T2pt8XkG/image14.png)](https://postimg.cc/rz21W7XY)\n\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n## Timeline & Milestones\n\n* Immediately following the acceptance of the proposal, Artmatr will begin development of a custom Nouns DAO creative interface and the construction of a Nouns-sponsored Matr Labs rack. We will open up private social channels on Discord and provide regular updates on the progress made on both the hardware and software development. We will stay active in those channels for enthusiasts of the technology to engage with our team of artists and engineers and also promote the project development publicly via our Twitter & Instagram. \n* Artmatr will use the community Nouns as our test materials during the summer development process, and will publish the results as the works are formed.\n* Near the public launch of the Matr portal, we will airdrop Matr Labs x Nouns redemption tokens to all wallets holding Nouns. We will continue to distribute those tokens to new holders up to #1,000.\n* We will officially launch the token-gated Nouns website for the community to start generating works using the Nouns on August 1. Shortly thereafter, we will host a live gallery event at Artmatr in NYC near the August 8th Nouniversary. We will exhibit the community Nouns created by Artmatr at the event, and allow Nouns holders the ability to create their work live that day.\n* The community-exclusive MATRing will remain active until January 31, allowing the community to create unique works of art from the Nouns that they hold in their wallets, utilizing a specialized UI which includes a number of AI and algorithmic features. Noun holders will be able to customize their Noun to create a unique work of art using pens, brushes, and our proprietary painting tools, MATRed on acid-free, archival grade 100 lb Bristol cardstock. The works will be shipped to each community member as they are made free of charge.\n* Timelapse video and hi-rez photos of each work will be collected and collated by our automated systems, and will be used to generate additional visibility of the project via dedicated Twitter and Discord channels. The content will also be available on our website, and used to update the metadata of the redemption tokens, transforming the airdrop into a new collection of MATRed Nouns.\n* We commit to doing everything we can to ensure the anonymity of the Nouns DAO community. We are closely aligned with a number of other cryptoart companies who have been working to address this issue (Artfora, for example) and we are working with them on solutions. We are exploring address escrow services, secure databases that automatically delete information after use, and other methods. We want to work with the community in a variety of ways to ensure as many people have access to physical prints as possible and would post instructions on how to address a package to a UPS store or PO Box for additional anonymization.\n\n[![image8.png](https://i.postimg.cc/63Q2kYc1/image8.png)](https://postimg.cc/HJfk50fQ)\n\n[![table2.png](https://i.postimg.cc/zfMYNk1G/table2.png)](https://postimg.cc/bGQBHkJ7)\n\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n\n## About\n\nArtmatr’s team of experts from the art, robotics, Web3, and marketing worlds are focused on broadly expanding every artists’ creative toolkit. We want to make our highly sophisticated hardware and software technologies available to everyone, from the biggest names in art to an emerging creative at home. We have so far demonstrated our ability to execute bespoke projects at a small scale, and now we are ready to start opening the doors to the world at-large. \n\nLed by CEO Rafael Feitelberg and CCO Ben Tritt, Artmatr’s creative studio in Brooklyn and R&D lab in Israel are developing revolutionary art-making tools and techniques. Our Brooklyn studio has a steady stream of artists coming in with brand new creative ideas unlocked thanks to our expanding technology. This tech platform is a significant part of our future development pipeline with the artists, platforms and galleries that we are working with. We also are developing ways for the public to access this tech and “Matr” their own custom creations. We have plans to scale this product to democratize the creation of physical artwork. In the medium term, it will allow us to have a sustainable solution for artists to work on ideas that may be higher volume and more accessible to a larger collector base. Having Nouns DAO as our development sponsor will accelerate our timeline and product viability for artists to start using it. We think this will be one of our marquee tools, and Nouns will cement themselves in the art community with the legacy and visibility of being the first to use it.\n\nSince our launch mid-2022, we have had successful projects with Tyler Hobbs, Zancan, Matthew Stone and Matthew Day Jackson, and our 2023 pipeline is full of exciting projects with blue-chip and emerging artists alike.\n\nArtmatr’s Investors & Strategic Partners:\n\n\n* [Delphi Digital](https://delphidigital.io): Delphi Digital is the leading research organization for crypto assets.

I think we stand to benefit from explicitly approaching this. Lets try to actually learn some lessons in the grand virtuous cycle experiment.\n\nIn the previous prop past art was referenced as selling for more than 250k, yet the pieces from Prop 224 did not raise auction prices by anywhere close to that. We did not move the needle on auction prices as planned, there was a disconnect.\n\nBut - they did a few things right. They raised auction prices in a way that was clearly attributed to their efforts, meaning they effectively caught people's attention and converted this into bids, proving that the approach is a possibility. They earned genuine enthusiasm from a number of Nouners during the week, I enjoyed their posts on twitter, the events they held, and this video: https://vimeo.com/829178232.\n\nI think it makes sense to readjust and try again, and they have. This proposal offers 1001 physical pieces at a significantly lower per-piece cost to the DAO. On top of this, and most importantly, this is paired with 10 months of marketing, comms, and events. \n\nI am in favour of this proposal. For it to be considered a success, and receive further funding, we need to see a sustained increase in average auction price. If it increases by about 1 ETH over the next 264 days we break even.\n\nIf this passes I hope the team puts serious effort into drawing attention to their art and the daily Nouns auction.

Their efforts to keep their team members in school, out of gangs, off the streets and involved in their community through skateboarding has been recognized by the Long Beach Unified School District and the City of Long Beach.\n\nASK is responsible for all 10 Long Beach skateparks. Their skate team has more than 175 members, ages 3-25, comprised of diverse genders and ethnicities, and applications continue to come in every day. \n\n### PROJECT OVERVIEW\nThe effort to reimagine the Silverado Skatepark began in April 2021 with the encouragement of local skaters. The 5,000-square-foot skatepark was built on an old basketball court located on the west side of Long Beach, California. Separated by the Los Angeles River from the rest of the city, it is the only skatepark in underserved West Long Beach. The elements in the park were relocated from the Michael K. Green and Bixby (Cherry) Skateparks after their respective refurbishment. Dew Tour also donated some in 2018. The park has undergone many repairs over the years. With the exception of a few elements, most are unrepairable and render the park useless due to excessive use.\n\nThe skatepark project has been approved by the office of City of Long Beach Councilmember Roberto Uranga and the City of Long Beach Department of Parks, Recreation and Marine. On September 16, 2021, the City issued a two-year right of access to build the skatepark.\n\n![Skatepark Pic](https://i.imgur.com/Or8RX6g.png)\n![Skatepark Pic2](https://i.imgur.com/uVjAGeg.png)\n*“Our mission at ASK is to empower youth through sports, education, and community. This skatepark is in an underserved area and was heavily used. Rebuilding it will bring back a beloved activity and after-school alternative for at-risk youth.”* - Mike Donelon, founder and executive director of ASK\n\n\n\n### FUNDING OPPORTUNITY\nThis proposal requests a total of ~87 ETH upfront from the DAO for the entire project. See attached cost breakdown.\n\n![Skate Park Reno](https://i.imgur.com/jgimcz9.png)\n***Sample Mockup, exact art not shown.** Detailed Nouns Artwork (Noun Characters, Noggles, ect) will be illustrated on various fixtures throughout the park.*\n\n### TIMELINE\nThe project is expected to take a maximum of four weeks to complete. The exact start date depends on the builders’ schedule, but ASK anticipates beginning the construction during summer 2023. Please note the schedule can only be finalized once funding is secured.\n\n\n**Nouns Artwork** — The Nouns artwork and noggles rail have been viewed and approved by the Long Beach Parks and Recreation Commission. Keen Ramps has recommended working with Van Eggers (@van_eggers), a talented illustrator working out of Long Beach. He has done work for clients such as Foundation Skateboards, Girl Skateboards and Deathwish Skateboards. Oni Apenoun will be coordinating with ASK and Van Eggers to provide assets and assist in creative direction.\n\n**Noggles Rail** — Keen Ramps will manage building, powder coating and installing the signature Noggles Rail.\n\nUpon approval of funding, Spohn Ranch will carry out the project according to the original design, excluding the Nouns rail and artwork. Subsequently, they will handle the installation of the noogles rail and the painting of the artwork.\n\n### TSP PARTNERSHIP PROMOTION\nTSP will promote the partnership and funding support through dedicated social media posts on TSP's platforms. Additionally, TSP will include relevant tags and mentions in social media posts related to the skatepark project, extending its reach and generating a significant impact.\n\n### NOUNS X ASK LONG BEACH PARTNERSHIP HISTORY\n**October 2022** — Nouns DAO partnered with ASK Long Beach and TSP to give away skateboards to local youth at their team meeting/jams at Houghton Skatepark. The boards were funded and designed by Nouns DAO and built by TSP staff and volunteers.\n\n![Skatepark Kids Pic](https://i.imgur.com/0MftGcz.png)\n\n**January  2023** —  ASK Long Beach skateboarders showed their stuff aboard the “Meet the Nouns” float in the 134th annual Rose Parade in Pasadena, California. Mike Donelon and several team skaters participated, with some kids on the float and others skateboarding alongside it as it traveled down the parade route.\n\n![Rose Parade Pic](https://i.imgur.com/X8qWJyy.png)\n\n\n![Budget1](https://i.imgur.com/k8J1rs1.png)\n![Budget2](https://i.imgur.com/uiChV7P.png)\n\n\n= ~86.7 ETH @ 1892 USD / ETH\n \n### Transaction Details\n```\ntx1: One time payment to TSP\ntx2: USDC Auto-refill transaction automatically added to top off the DAO's USDC Funding Pool for future Proposals\n```","proposer":"0x91dCCAA260CC4616E1a6e6b693DB7207C5E42937","startBlock":17430929,"endBlock":17466929,"executed":true},"votes":[{"support":1,"voter":"0xFC218F1164cfEf8e4EC7c2aca8fB019DC8976214","numberOfVotes":20,"reason":"(noun40 voting via agora)\n\nfinally an actual nounish skate park prop! it's a bit of a shame that the prop doesn't include actual design mockups but trusting oni to deliver something great with the local artist.

At its peak, [block censorship reached ~80%](https://www.mevwatch.info/).\n\nIn response to the public concern, the Flashbots team accelerated [open sourcing their relay code](https://writings.flashbots.net/Flashbots-Relay-open-sourcing) and many teams sprinted towards building non-censoring relay alternatives.\n\nTwo such relays succeeded in gaining meaningful traction—the [ultra sound relay](https://relay.ultrasound.money/) and the [Agnostic relay](https://www.gnosis.io/blog/agnostic-relay-a-credibly-neutral-tool) by the Gnosis team—resulting in the dramatic reduction of censored blocks earlier this year.\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BJo0cF7I2.png)\n(screenshot from [mevboost.pics](https://mevboost.pics/))\n\nIt's worth noting that such gains in relay market share was not attained simply by launching a copy-paste non-censoring fork of the Flashbots relay. The ultra sound relay team had to actually build a lower latency relay through innovations of their own such as [optimistic](https://github.com/michaelneuder/optimistic-relay-documentation/blob/main/proposal.md) [relaying](https://github.com/ultrasoundmoney/mev-boost-relay/blob/prod-optimistic-relaying/docs/optimistic/an-optimistic-weekend.md) and various devops optimizations.\n\nultra sound relay's market share has been capped around 33% lately because the team is committed to self-cap its dominance to 1/3 of Ethereum blocks to foster relay diversity. They are also working closely with [Mike Neuder](https://twitter.com/mikeneuder) from the EF to help accelerate R&D for [enshrined PBS](https://ethresear.ch/t/why-enshrine-proposer-builder-separation-a-viable-path-to-epbs/15710) that would eliminate the need for relays entirely.\n\n---\n\n## Why should Nouns fund the ultra sound relay?\n\n**1. To continue to express our alignment with Ethereum and its values.**\n\nNouns is a [headless brand](https://otherinter.net/research/headless-brands/). There is no PR head that builds coherent brand identities. Instead, we are what we do.\n\nSo far our track record is strong:\n* We've always held our treasury entirely in ETH or stETH.\n* We've always focused on decentralization and onchain governance.\n* We've always insisted on open sourcing wherever possible, including our own brand IP.\n* We've always cared deeply about public goods.\n\nIt's important to continue these things. To have an identity. To be who we are.\n\nEthereum-aligned public goods we've funded so far in our history:\n* [Prop 21](https://nouns.wtf/vote/21) — donating 169 ETH to Gitcoin grants.\n* [Prop 108](https://nouns.wtf/vote/108) — donating 500 ETH to Ethereum protocol development via the Protocol Guild.\n* [Prop 184](https://nouns.wtf/vote/184) — donating 100 ETH to ZachXBT.\n* [Prop 249](https://nouns.wtf/vote/249) — giving out 30 ETH to Ethereum solo stakers.\n* [Prop 278](https://nouns.wtf/vote/278) — donating 55 ETH to the Gitcoin crypto advocacy round.\n\nWe should be proud of what we've done so far but we must continue. Ethereum-aligned public goods are the substrates of our onchain world and funding them is an important expression of who we are and what we stand for.\n\n**2. To reach prospective DAO members that also care about Ethereum and the onchain world.**\n\nCharismatic giving towards public goods creates [news](https://www.theblock.co/post/193256/nouns-dao-donates-to-zachxbt) and generates [viral attention](https://twitter.com/noun40__/status/1598084457596325888) like anything else we might fund in an attempt to proliferate our brand and attract the attention of prospective DAO members.\n\nFunding Ethereum public goods is particularly useful in this regard since ETH holders and onchain world enthusiasts who care about Ethereum public goods are also (at least currently) our primary prospective DAO member demographic.\n\n---\n\n# Other details\n\n**Who is on the ultra sound relay team?**\n[AlphaMonad](https://twitter.com/AlphaMonad) leads the dev effort, with support from [alex](https://twitter.com/alextes) and [Justin Drake](https://twitter.com/drakefjustin).\n\n**Does the ultra sound money team need the funding?**\nThis proposal is meant to recognize what has been accomplished (more like an award) not necessarily fund future work so the proposal does not focus on this aspect. However, the team communicated that funding is currently very tight, cloud bills alone costing ~$15k per month, so the funding would be very welcome.\n\n**What other funding sources does ultra sound relay team have?**\nA 10 ETH per month no-strings-attached donation from a top MEV-boost builder is the primary funding source according to the team.\n\n**Any conflict of interest?**\nThe proposer ([Noun 40](https://twitter.com/noun40__)) has no prior (or planned future) personal or business relationship with anyone on the ultra sound relay team.  Reaching out to ask for permission to make this proposal was the first and only connection.\n\n**Why not also fund the Agnostic relay by the Gnosis team as well?**\nThe ETH prize felt a bit superflous given that the Gnosis DAO has a [$260M treasury](https://zapper.xyz/daos/gnosis-dao) of their own but they definitely deserve high praise for stepping up and maintaining a successful non-censoring public good relay as well!","proposer":"0xaE65E700f3f8904ac1007d47a5309dD26f8146c0","startBlock":17459594,"endBlock":17495594,"executed":true},"votes":[{"support":1,"voter":"0xA86882277E69FbF0a51805cdc8b0a3a113079E63","numberOfVotes":2,"reason":"Nouns should celebrate outstanding achievements in our immediate ecosystem."},{"support":0,"voter":"0x3377Fc947899f6F961Bf7B00e364538178277d99","numberOfVotes":0,"reason":"Testing in prod pls disregard "},{"support":1,"voter":"0x008c84421dA5527F462886cEc43D2717B686A7e4","numberOfVotes":16,"reason":""},{"support":0,"voter":"0xCEEd9585854F12F81A0103861b83b995A64AD915","numberOfVotes":2,"reason":"I appreciate the underlying concept of supporting efforts around creating censorship resistant systems but can't support this prop without a legal opinion from our Foundation.

I'm generally in favor of supporting public goods software, but this seems like its just a one time payment for nothing in return. It’s not that I don’t support “goodwill”, it’s just that I’m not sure how one measures that, which makes it hard to justify. By the above logic, why not donate 500E or 1000E? Or why not send 100E to vitalik for all of his contributions to public goods?\n\nPart of the appeal of a dao to me is to be able to coordinate groups of ppl to do things they couldn’t normally do individually- when it comes to things like pure donations, its not clear to me why people couldn’t just donate to the specific causes in the specific amounts they prefer.\n\nThere's a maxim \"Price is what you pay, value is what you get.\" My concern with props where we are \"giving back to the ecosystem\" without any detail or plan is that if feels like blanket spend based on the hope that it ends up being valuable in some nebulous way.  There's nothing wrong with funding ideas with potentially high but unclear value, but that becomes a slippery slope to spending increasing amts b/c \"theres no way to measure the upside anyways\".\n\nShould the ultrasound team have approached us for some kind of funding (sponsorship, or funding some new project, etc) I would be in support of that, but as a matter of principle I don't think I am in favor of just giving something away.\n\nAt this point in the vote it looks clear to pass, and I'm happy to disagree and commit, but I still want to memorialize my reasoning on chain as a reference for future votes.

Ethereum’s core values include censorship resistance, and that is something very few groups are willing to fund. Ensuring that MEV relayers are neutral is key as more and more organizations consolidate on a small number of relayers.\n\nIn addition, Ultra Round Relay is a good example of something that other organizations won’t fund. Nouns is the perfect group in the ecosystem to fund this.\n\nOne detail of the prop that I would have liked to see is some kind of promotion that Ultra Sound Relay gives Nouns. This could range from a simple “Sponsored by Nouns ⌐◨-◨” to something fun, like special callouts for blocks with Nouns Graffiti. The prop points to goodwill and attention generated by these donations, which is true but attention is often brief. I’d love to see something more ongoing in collaboration with Ultra Sound Relay. Given that Noun 40 has been in communication with the Ultra Sound Relay team, I don’t see this as necessary in the prop, but it would be nice to follow up when the prop is completed. This kind of promotion is a way to continue to attract people with Ethereum’s values to Nouns, and it is important for ideological alignment.\n\nOne important note: Given the liability considerations around OFAC, I am voting “Abstain” rather than “For.” DAOs badly need solutions to limit liability for voters, but the aggressive interpretation taken by regulators makes it harder to take this risk. Allowing voters to freely express speech without significant concerns for the liability surrounding those actions is important, and something I’ve been personally researching and would love to bring to Nouns. While I continue this research, I will vote “Abstain.” I sincerely hope that we can figure out approaches that would allow me to freely vote “For.”"},{"support":1,"voter":"0x0055CD5F017027D10ADF4f13332181e6D8D886BB","numberOfVotes":2,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x70eCe45cDc64A768f936Ccb8aC851578251363e3","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0xE6397F9A08F456541814efcE5dbB26e37Ed44268","numberOfVotes":2,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0xF9bf4c994B39D742E568096A04637EDc5E8e6fdA","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":0,"voter":"0xDCb4117e3A00632efCaC3C169E0B23959f555E5e","numberOfVotes":17,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x75CA7ad7A0088f131ABE8C11afEc969fF15C3f73","numberOfVotes":14,"reason":"we will continue to vote for necessary public goods that add value to the Ethereum ecosystem"},{"support":1,"voter":"0x8ac3ecf6973E020cC0E6e8989Fb71B4a77D65987","numberOfVotes":2,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x281eC184E704CE57570614C33B3477Ec7Ff07243","numberOfVotes":2,"reason":"Nouns DAO was built on Ethereum.

This will encourage thoughtful applications of capital, esp. where the proposed funding seems more remotely related to Nouns` brand and purpose. Further, given the grant already given to Protocol Guild (500 ETH), this would seem to overlap and open Nouns up to many such requests on top of its existing, demonstrated commitment to ETH protocol support and public goods.

Forbes has recognized the platform for its innovative approach to revolutionizing the tennis industry. NTF is now ready to take the next steps in fostering the development of elite tennis talent, enhancing fan engagement, and positioning NounsDAO in front of a global audience of hundreds of millions.\n\nTo achieve these goals, NTF will harness its tennis stars as brand ambassador powerhouses. They will compete in custom NTF Noggles apparel at some of the world's biggest sporting events and actively promote NounsTennisFam through their impressive social media reach. Additionally, NTF will provide a fairer and more transparent on-chain infrastructure for developing elite tennis talent and democratizing the sport.\n\nBy supporting emerging players and enhancing fan engagement, NTF will make a mark on the industry, paving the way for a sustainable ecosystem for talent development, sponsorship opportunities, and interactive experiences. This will leave a legacy and transform NounsTennisFam into a well-known and respected name in the industry.\n\nIn line with NounsDAO's mission of decentralization and community-driven initiatives, NTF will offer a comprehensive suite of resources for professional and aspiring tennis players, including funding, training, and community support. Empowering pros, prospects, and fans and transforming them into a community of benefactors invested in one another's success is the future of sports. Together, let's change the game and establish NounsTennisFam as a major force in professional tennis.\n\n# TL;DR\n\nNounsTennisFam is set to revolutionize the tennis industry through blockchain technology and democratization of the sport by providing fair compensation for investors and talent. With the goal of becoming a cornerstone of the global tennis market valued at $5.6 billion, NounsTennisFam aims to represent athletes and connect fans under the NounsDAO banner in front of millions of fans worldwide.\n\n## Key Objectives\n![](https://i.postimg.cc/3Jn3LBfZ/3.png)\n- Noggles and NounsTennisFam (NTF) branded jerseys to be worn by co-founder Borna Coric (World No 20 Croatian tennis star) in grand slams and other major events, with millions of views and discussions about Nouns and NTF in pre/post-match press conferences.\n- Develop the \"NounsTennisFam\" platform to support up-and-coming athletes by funding them through the issuance of their own digital collectibles, which translates to a portion of the athletes' future game/endorsement earnings.\n- Gain support from athletes such as Real Madrid/Croatian football star Luka Modric, Grand Slam winner Marin Cilic, and others in Borna's network.\n- Provide branded NTF/Noggles competition apparel for all NTF-sponsored athletes, seen by millions.\n- Support underprivileged communities to ensure that economics do not stand in the way of talent.\n- Create new opportunities for fans to interact with sports, invest, and be a part of an athlete's journey from the beginning while learning about web 3 in the process.\n- Establish NounsTennis Fam as a household name in professional sports.\n\nThis collaboration presents a tremendous opportunity for NounsDAO to gain incredible exposure before a global audience and create lasting value for the brand while supporting emerging prospects and established professionals in the tennis industry.\n\n# Opportunity of a Lifetime\n\n## Tennis Viewership Numbers Reveal the Sport's Widespread Appeal and Growing Popularity\n\nMajor tournaments, all of which NTF Co-founder, Borna competes in, attract millions of viewers worldwide. In 2021, Wimbledon reached a global audience of over 500 million viewers, while the French Open and the Australian Open had 350 million and 900 million viewers, respectively (source: Grand Slam Board). This global audience provides a significant opportunity for NounsTennisFam to engage a passionate user base and secure NounsDAO significant exposure before an army of loyal fans.\n\n## Sports on the Blockchain\n\nAccording to Grand View Research, Inc., the global sports market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 3.3% from 2020 to 2027, driven by increasing participation in sports, the rising popularity of sports leagues, and the growing demand for sports-related merchandise. Although this report does not specifically address tennis, a Nielsen Sports report forecasts tennis viewership to continue growing in the United States, fueled by top players' popularity and the rise of new stars like Coco Gauff. The US Open, in particular, has experienced significant growth, with a 33% increase in average audience per match in 2021 compared to the previous year. This suggests the potential for the sport to continue to grow in popularity and reach new audiences, offering a substantial opportunity for NounsDAO to engage with a large audience eager for innovative solutions like the NounsTennisFam platform.\n\n## Success stories\n\n### Tennis Australia\n\nTennis Australia collaborated with the Australian Open to incorporate blockchain technology and NFTs into the event. The final bounce of winning points was linked to corresponding NFTs known as \"Artballs.\" Fans owning these NFTs won various rewards, such as tickets to the next year's tournament. The Australian Open also utilized the metaverse, creating a replica of the Rod Laver Arena in Decentraland and engaging with millions of users in a Roblox experience. These initiatives led to increased viewership and fan engagement, demonstrating the potential of blockchain technology in sports.\n\n### NBA Top Shot\n\nNBA Top Shot is a blockchain-based platform that allows fans to buy, sell, and trade officially licensed NBA collectible highlights (NFTs). Its success factors include a strategic partnership with the NBA, a user-friendly platform, and scarcity-driven value of collectibles.\n\n### Socios.com\n\nSocios.com is a blockchain-based fan engagement platform for sports teams. Its success factors include partnerships with top-tier football clubs, fan token offerings (FTOs), and voting rights for fans on certain club decisions.\n\nThese examples exhibit incredible potential for blockchain technology to revolutionize fan engagement, sports financing, and brand name recognition.\n\n## Key Benefits of Collaboration\n\n### Team and Experience\n\nBoasting Ivy League graduates, professional athletes, proven entrepreneurs, and Web3 experts, the NounsTennisFam team is prepared to catapult NounsDAO into the professional tennis spotlight as a fresh, inventive, and distinguished new brand.\n\n![](https://i.postimg.cc/mZzdHWfk/Screen-Shot-2023-06-07-at-1-04-23-am.png)\n\n| [Co-founder Borna Ćorić](https://www.atptour.com/en/players/borna-coric/cg80/overview) | [Co-founder & CCO Bruna Ćorić](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bruna-%C4%87ori%C4%87-916784b5/) | [Co-founder & CEO Bruno Pliso](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bruno-pliso-1a29a6176/) | [Creative Director Nina Turudic](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nikolina-turudic-ab29b4b2/) |\n\n| [Finance & Operations Ivan Turudic](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ivan-turudi%C4%87-18657a155/) | [CTO Karlo Brdek](https://www.linkedin.com/in/karlo-brdek) | [CMO Sven Stanko](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sven-stanko-545751ba/) | NFT Advisor, Dapper VP Fran Brajcic | [Web3 Consultant Shan Kumar](http://https://twitter.com/shanicucic96) |\n\n\n# Platform Features and User Experience\n\n![](https://i.postimg.cc/1RNDSMdm/platform.png)\n\nNounsTennisFam platform offers a range of features designed to create a transparent, fair, and sustainable ecosystem to attract and connect tennis pros, new talent, and fans. \n\n1. **Platform & Launchpad:** The platform uses blockchain technology to establish a secure and transparent infrastructure to support emerging tennis talent. The NTF dApp enables fans to sponsor young and underprivileged players through funds generated by launchpad mints and commercial sponsorship deals. \n2. **Player Exclusive Launchpad & Drops**: This feature allows established players and potential professionals to tokenize a portion of their anticipated earnings, providing financial support. The platform offers two types of drops: Professional Drops (seasonal tokens) and Prospect Drops (sponsorship tokens), catering to different stages of a player’s career. \n3. **The Fam Section**: An exclusive content and social networking dashboard for NTF Asset holders, providing access to exclusive content, networking opportunities, and various benefits determined by the athletes. \n4. **Athletes & Valuation**: The platform features verified ATP and WTA players and up-and-coming prospects, with advisory and selection support from Borna’s management agency, Kozmos Holding. Drops are valued individually, with tokens representing a fraction of the total fractionalized prize money. Professional player valuations are based on historical performance data and a proprietary model, while prospect valuations involve negotiations and selection for either a Prospect pool or a Player exclusive drop, guided by the expertise of Kozmos Holding.\n\nTogether, NounsTennisFam and NounsDAO can actively support emerging tennis superstars by addressing one of their most significant challenges–funding, while providing a framework for established professionals to enter the Web3 space through fractionalized earnings. This approach will strengthen our brand and further democratizes the sport of tennis. Additionally, this collaboration will place NounsTennisFam at the forefront of a vast global tennis market, valued at $5.6 billion in 2019 (Source: ITF). Notably, 46% of global tennis fans have a household income of $75,000 or more (Source: ITF), representing a demographic well-suited to become NounsDAO community members.\n\n# Existing Partnerships and Collaborations\n\nNounsTennisFam has already established integral strategic partnerships with tennis academies, professional players, sport management giants, and Web3 projects that enhance the platform’s features and user experience. Our collaborations within the tennis industry allow us to tap into the impressive viewership numbers of events, such as the Wimbledon 2019, with a peak audience of 9.6 million viewers in the UK alone (Source: BBC), and the French Open 2020 final, with a peak audience of 3.3 million viewers in France (Source: SportsPro). \n\nThese partnerships provide credibility and enable NounsTennisFam to engage with tennis fans and connect with Web3 natives through our blockchain partners. By utilizing these alliances, we will expand our reach to tennis enthusiasts and the growing Web3 community, fostering a comprehensive and sustainable ecosystem for developing elite tennis talent and increasing fan engagement.\n\n## Meet our Athletes\n\nProfessional supporters actively promoting the platform and its vision to their extensive fan bases, generating global awareness and support for the project.\n\n- **Borna Ćorić** (ATP Rank #20)\n- **Luka Modrić** (Real Madrid)\n- **Ajla Tomljanović** (WTA Rank #47)\n- **Marin Cilic** (ATP Rank #22)\n- **Ana Konjuh** (WTA Rank #145)\n- **Marcelo Brozovic** (Midfielder, Inter Milan)\n- **Filip Krajinovic** (ATP Rank #65)\n- **Donna Vekic** (WTA Rank #32) \n\n## Web3 Collaborators\n\nOur Web3 partnership will bring fans and players together and help make tennis successful on the blockchain.

By exploring the diverse set of revenue streams available within the global tennis market and tapping into the endorsement incomes of top tennis players, the partnership between NounsDAO and NounsTennisFam can achieve long-term financial sustainability and create lasting value for all stakeholders involved.\n\nTo further ensure the continued success and sustainability of the partnership, several strategies have been put in place to accommodate the unique needs and opportunities presented by the evolving tennis landscape and the Web3 ecosystem:\n\n- Implement a revenue-sharing model that benefits investors, players, and the platform, with a portion of the platform’s earnings allocated for player development and platform improvements.\n- Pursuing partnerships and collaborations with other Web3 projects and tennis organizations to expand our user base and increase revenue streams.\n- Continue to engage and communicate with the NounsDAO community and other stakeholders to ensure that the platform meets their needs and expectations.\n- Building a sustainable talent pipeline by supporting emerging players and reinvesting in their development.\n- Regularly monitoring and assessing market trends and adjusting our strategies accordingly.\n\nThrough these strategies, we are confident that the partnership between NounsDAO and NounsTennisFam will achieve long-term financial sustainability, create lasting value, and continued familiarity within the industry.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, collaboration between NounsTennisFam and NounsDAO presents a significant opportunity to revolutionize the tennis industry through blockchain technology, democratize the sport, and introduce NounsDAO as a major brand and catalyst for positive change in professional sports.\n\nBy tapping into a global tennis market valued at $5.6 billion (source: ITF) and engaging with a passionate fanbase, this partnership is poised for success. The potential for audience engagement is evident in the 2022 US Open, where the third-round match between Serena Williams and Ajla Tomljanovich (Public Supporter of PTF) became the most-watched tennis telecast in ESPN’s 43-year history, with an average of 4.6 million viewers (ESPN Press Room, 2022). As tennis viewership continues to grow, the NounsTennisFam stands to benefit from increasing popularity within an immense, global audience of sports fans while building the NounsTennisFam brand. Together, we can positively impact the sport and its community, help shape the future, and gain significant brand recognition.\n![](https://i.postimg.cc/J4NJD0mS/Nouns-Tennis-Fam.png)\n","proposer":"0xAd7Bbe006c8D919Ffcf6148b227Bb692F7D1fbc7","startBlock":17460004,"endBlock":17496004,"executed":false},"votes":[]},{"prop":{"id":306,"description":"# SNP - SD Comic Con: Connecting a Cornucopia of Creators\n\n**TLDR:**\nNouns Town crew will head to SD Comic Con to gift 2,500 Nouns Activity Books to artists and collectors and commission 100+ Nounish artworks from industry pros + proliferate the meme through friends and peer collaborations.\nTotal cots $57,500.00\n\n## SD Comic Con: Connecting a Cornucopia of Creators\nSan Diego Comicon happens in July of 2023, and is a gathering of fans of pop culture, along with the artists that create content for them. With six figures of people walking through the doors, it has become one of the largest gatherings for talented people in the world. Those that write and draw comics, books, web series, movies and television, everyone goes to connect to the fans that keep them employed and appreciate them.\n\nBringing in outside artists to Nouns would be a huge boon to the ecosystem. It would bring different creative perspectives to an artistic project, but also bring in a fan base that currently has no real visibility to Nouns. If we engage creators, get them excited, we have already seen that they will then plug themselves into Nouns, engage with Nouns, while still engaging with the medium they are experts in.\n\nNouns is in a unique position to make dreams come true for creators that would otherwise be dissatisfied with their lot in their industry. If Eastman and Laird (the creators of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles) had access to Nouns, not only would they have brought Nouns iconography to their books, but they would have had an outlet to seek funding, letting Nouns fund the Turtles, which would later become a licensing juggernaut. This is a perfect end use case for Nouns collabs with creators.\n\nOur first step is to go to San Diego, connect with as many creatives as we can. We will get them to do commissioned work (which we will pay for) in a special Nouns sketch book, of which we will print many copies. This will let us open a dialogue with them to discuss Nouns, cc0, the benefits of the ecosystem, and how they might benefit from introducing themselves here.\n\nWe will aim for over 100 creators’ commissions, giving Nouns many different versions and interpretations of Nouns and Nounish things from established artists, introduce the artists to us and cc0, and finally create inroads for further exploration in the near future. We will spread our net wide, but go for the premier artists in the industry (Jim Lee, Todd McFarlane, Geoff Darrow, etc.) along with the more traditional artists. Having been in this industry for two dozen years, I am comfortable saying I can have a conversation with any level of talent.\n\n**Nouns Sketch Book:** We will print 2,500 copies of a Nouns sketch book, with pages from the Nouns comic book contained within, as well as colouring pages, how to draw Nouns, and blank pages. We will give these away to creators, encouraging them to fill up the blank pages and give them back at the end.\n\n**Commission payments:** This is the main source of income for creators at conventions, so we will be paying for each commissioned work. We will specify that we wish something to do with Nouns (and the pages containing Nouns will give them plenty of reference material). The rate paid will be dependent upon the work they are doing, along with what their standard rate is. As a rough estimate, we will aim to pay $300 USD for a full sketch of a Noun in the creators’ style.\n\nWe will need to have the books printed and delivered to San Diego no later than July 17th of 2023. This means we wish to be at the printer by the last week of June, which is our goal. Having decades of experience making monthly comic books, I am comfortable saying this will be 100% achievable. We have the designers, printers, shipper and storage lined up. It was essential to plot out the viability of accomplishing this prior to suggesting it.\n\nWho: Nouns Town team of Danny Schlitz, Adam & Bennet + Joshua Fisher\n\n**How Much:**\n$15,000 USD - Creating, Printing and Shipping 2,500 Nouns Sketch Books\n$30,000 USD - Commission Payments for 100+ Commissions\n$12,5000 USD - Adam, Josh, Danny & Bennet will be there manage the facilitation of the books and creators, as well as scanning the art pieces for the DAO afterwards.

The first event, held in 2022, was financed by the 5ETH Small Grant from Nouns DAO. Primarily successful in Japan, we're planning to host the second event in 2023. This year, we aim to expand globally and attract more participants than before. The main objectives of the festival include:\n\n- Spreading awareness about the importance of a peaceful and sustainable Earth\n- Materializing the \"Public Good\" concept, which is integral to Nouns' principles\n- Broadening Nouns' recognition to a wider audience\n\nIn this proposal, we request a budget of 47.1ETH to accomplish these goals. The details follow.\n\n## Table of Contents ⌐◨-◨\n- Introduction\n- Our Commitment to This Film Festival\n- Preparations for the 2023 Festival\n  - Establishing New Submission Categories\n  - Intensifying Call for Entries\n  - Implementing a Participatory Voting System\n  - Enhancing Screenings and Award Ceremonies\n- Schedule\n- Budget\n- NounsFes Originators\n- Appendix: Achievements from 2022\n\n## Introduction ⌐◨-◨\nNounsFes is an online art festival, conceived by the members of NounsDAO, aiming to educate as many people as possible about the importance of a peaceful and sustainable Earth. Our theme, \"The Importance of a Peaceful and Sustainable Earth,\" embodies the principle of \"Public Good,\" which Nouns values greatly. This year, we aim to invite diverse submissions and offer more people an opportunity to understand the ideals behind Nouns and NounsFes.\n\n## Our Commitment to This Film Festival ⌐◨-◨\nWhile film festivals like the Cannes Film Festival and the Academy Awards are renowned, they're bound by traditional business models, prompting us to perceive a need for a new type of film festival. Information transmission methods vary from text, text and images, sound, sound and images, to video. It is clear that video is the most efficient way to communicate information. We believe that there is a huge future potential in short videos viewed through small smartphone screens, given the inconvenience of VR/AR glasses, despite emerging concepts like \"virtual space\" or \"metaverse.\"\n\n## Preparations for the 2023 Festival ⌐◨-◨\nThe first event in 2022 allowed us to introduce the importance of a peaceful and sustainable Earth within Japan via NounsFes. However, we have not yet managed to relay this concept to many who are unaware of Nouns. Hence, this year, we aim to familiarize more people with NounsFes and further disseminate the importance of a peaceful and sustainable Earth, and the principle of \"Public Good\" that Nouns values.\n\nNounsFes Updates:\n- Establishing new submission categories\n- Intensifying call for entries\n- Implementing a participatory voting system\n- Enhancing screenings and award ceremonies\n\n### 1. Introduction of New Categories\nThis year, we aim to encourage more people to submit more works by introducing new categories such as Short Video, Vertical Short Video, and Super Short Video. The added categories are designed to be easily accessible to anyone using their smartphones.\n\n- **Short Video Category**\n    The aim is to create 2-3 minute works that evoke emotions and contribute to a better future. The themes are love, peace, or sustainable earth (SDGs).\n    Example work: [Theme SDGs](https://youtu.be/bQoJqDi8490)\n[![](https://img.youtube.com/vi/bQoJqDi8490/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQoJqDi8490)\n    \n\n- **Vertical Short Video Category**\n    With the same aim and themes as the Short Video Category, this category calls for works that fully utilize the verticality of smartphone-recorded daily life.\n[![](https://img.youtube.com/vi/77mNcy0D-NU/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77mNcy0D-NU)\n\n- **Super Short Video Category**\n    This category calls for works under 60 seconds with the same aim and themes as above, focusing on capturing the viewer's heart in a short time.\n[![](https://img.youtube.com/vi/6sSjPzsFvPA/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sSjPzsFvPA)\n\n### 2. Strengthening the Collection of Works\nLast year, we received around 50 submissions. We are strengthening our efforts to attract more entries. The specific measures are as follows:\n1. Introduce new categories (Vertical Short Video and Super Short Video) to make it easier for more people to submit their works.\n2. Simplify the application process to ease the burden on applicants.\n3. Experiment with various new promotional activities.\n* Visit schools and directly approach students aspiring to be creators to encourage them to apply.\n* Conduct daily recruitment of submissions through official social media channels.\n* Renew the website and regularly update its content to attract more participants.\n* Run online commercials to generate interest and encourage applications from a wider audience.\n* Actively participate in various events and distribute leaflets to increase awareness.\n* Organize a press super-short video contest online to enhance visibility.\n* Collaborate with web3 influencers to become ambassadors and promote the event.\n* Implement various giveaway campaigns to generate interest and encourage participation.\n* Create mechanisms to provide real-time updates on application status and continue information dissemination.\n* Maintain ongoing communication and information dissemination to NounsDao and various Nouns sub-DAO members worldwide.\n* Utilize audio media and Twitter Spaces to regularly promote events and showcase submitted works. Specifically, collaborate with The NounSquare, a space hosted by pNouns every Friday, to disseminate information globally.\n\nThrough these publicity activities, ensure that the objectives of NounsFes are well-known and create an environment where many people submit their works.\n\n### 3. Establishing an All-Participation Voting System\nSubmitted works will be published on social media platforms (Youtube, TikTok) for review by participants with voting rights.\n\nLast year, we conducted voting using NFTs called \"Named Noun\" and \"Nouns Love\" from the collection as voting rights. This year, we will continue using these two NFTs as voting rights and further grant voting rights to NFT holders related to Nouns. This update aims to create a more accessible system for a larger number of people to participate in the voting process.\n\n### 4. Enrichment of Screening and Award Ceremonies\nThe award ceremony for outstanding works will be held after the screening. As before, we will host real events by renting a movie theater and invite the creators of the nominated works to walk the red carpet.\n\nFurthermore, at the venue, we will distribute/sell Nouns-related merchandise and conduct workshops to promote the various aspects of Nouns and enhance the excitement of the event. Many members of the Nouns proposal 228: NogglesJackTokyo are part of the project team this time. The event held on May 20-21, 2023, was a great success.\n\nHere are some examples of Nouns-related merchandise that were sold at that time.\n![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1030992113799798801/1117063446618456064/goods.jpg)\n\n\nThis is the movie of that time.\n{%youtube H2i0gGUXCnA %}\n\n\nThis time, we are accepting submissions from around the world. Attendance at the screening will be from various locations worldwide.\nFor those who cannot attend the venue on the day of the event, we aim to provide a virtual screening venue in metaverses or other virtual spaces, enabling a larger number of participants to join the screening.\n\n![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1030992113799798801/1117063447000121344/MetaVerse.jpg)\n\n## Schedule ⌐◨-◨ \n- Announcement : 2023/7/1 \n- Submission Period : 2023/7/10 - 11/30\n- Nominee Announcement : 2023/12/10 \n- Final Result Announcement (Screening) : 2023/12/21 (tentative) \n\n## Budget ⌐◨-◨\n### Project Expense Breakdown\n- Planning, Operation, Accounting : 3.8 ETH\n- Website Development : 7.5 ETH\n- Content Management : 4.2 ETH\n- PR Activities : 4.5 ETH\n- Event Expenses : 3.8 ETH\n150,000 yen (theater), Travel and transportation expenses 300,000 yen (awardees), 500,000 yen (others)\n- Gift Expenses : 1.3 ETH\n\n### Prize Money\n- *Total: 22.0 ETH*\n  - Short category: Best: 3 ETH x 1, Excellence: 2 ETH x 2, Honorable mention: 1 ETH x 3\n  - Vertical Short category: 0.5 ETH x 10 \n  - Super Short category: 0.5 ETH x 10\n  - PR Pre-contest: 0.1 ETH x 20\n\n### Total Budget: 47.1 ETH\n(Note: The requested amount for this proposal)\n\n## Organizer\n[**Satoshi Nakajima**](https://twitter.com/nounsfes) - Software architect of Windows95 and Founder of Xevo Inc.(Noun245 Owner)\n\n### Supported by:\n\n[**Singularity Society**](https://www.singularitysociety.org/) - An organization created to provide entrepreneurs who have the potential to shoulder the next era of Japan and the world with opportunities for study, discussion, information dissemination, networking, and entrepreneurship, and to support them in various ways.\n\n[**NounsDAO JAPAN**](https://twitter.com/NounsDAOJAPAN) - Japanese biggest community of Nouns.

Please direct all questions to the NFT Yearbook team.\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HyW-BwaVh.jpg)\n\n## TLDR\n\n\nProposal for Funding from NOUNSDAO to Support the NFT Yearbook Project\n\nThe NFT Yearbook is a unique blend of a digital and physical artifact that boasts 420 pages and weighs 6.9 pounds. It is the largest democratically populated chronicling of the NFT space, and with the support of the NOUNSDAO, we aim to spread the word of web3, NOUNS, and cryptoart around the world, claiming our shared narrative and telling the story of web3 through the eyes of those building it.\n\nThe project has chronicled the web3 narrative from the very beginning to 2022, featuring contributions from over 550 artists, collectors, founders, creators, and community members through a democratic nomination process. The yearbook is a valuable resource for anyone interested in learning more about the history and future of web3.\n\nWe believe that NOUNSDAO is a perfect fit for supporting the NFT Yearbook project. The DAO is a community of dedicated web3 enthusiasts who are passionate about spreading the word about this new technology. With the DAO's support, we can reach a wider audience and make a greater impact.\n  \n\nIn collaboration with NOUNSDAO, we propose:\na) Adding the NOUNS DAO logo, visuals, and content to all 3000 NFT Yearbooks.\nb) Creating a limited edition NFT Yearbook with a custom NOUNS cover, to be airdropped to all NOUNS holders.\nc) Printing and strategically placing 100 additional custom NOUNSDAO NFT Yearbooks around the world in stratigic libraries / museums such as Harvard Business School, which has already collected 2 NFT Yearbooks for their libraries and permanent archives.\n\nThe total cost for this proposal is 88.6815 Ξ\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/B163wP6Eh.jpg)\n\n## Introduction\n\nThe NFT Yearbook project has captured a snapshot of the rapidly evolving web3 landscape. It's a comprehensive 420-page, 6.9lbs coffee table book, and a 3D digital readable. It spotlights over 550 artists, collectors, founders, creators, and community members, including many NOUNS fam.\nLink to participants list: https://twitter.com/i/lists/1559260935520411650 \n\nThroughout the past year, we've accumulated over 750 hours of recorded interviews, encapsulating the web3 narrative from the perspectives of those who are actively shaping it.\n\nA notable aspect of our project is its community-driven nature. The book was co-written and co-curated by the community. Each interviewee nominated other participants for the book, ensuring diversity, equality, and inclusivity.\n\nWe've also introduced a unique feature to increase engagement: blank content spaces as rarity traits. These spaces allow random NFT holders to contribute to the final version of the book, both digital and physical. See the 1/1 cover created by 0xDariush here: https://player.vimeo.com/video/826545378\n\nBeing a 100% bootstrapped and small team, we've strived to ensure that all artists involved in the project can profit from their contributions by creating a 1:1 cover for the book, auctioned on SuperRare, with 100% of the profits returning to the artists.\n\nIn a month and a half, our [1/1 sales](https://superrare.com/series/0x1e3eac91085df57b4aa417b1471349d0bdb19152) have reached 58.150Ξ. Moreover, three artists were invited to SuperRare thanks to the NFT Yearbook project. 79 artists took part in the 1/1 covers and our all-time high sale was 10ETH by thr33som3s.\n\nOur main collection of NFT Yearbooks is hosted on OpenSea, and we've sold 1277 units out of the 3000 total, to date.\n\nWe're proud to announce that the NFT Yearbook was already collected by libraries at Harvard University/HBS, and the books will be placed in their permanent archives. This opportunity would place a NOUNS DAO limited edition cover yearbook in two of the most significant academic libraries globally, cementing its cultural significance.\n\nWith this proposal we aim to increase the reach of the NOUNSDAO with the historically important content of the NFT Yearbook, to an additional 100 locations worldwide (famed libraries, galleries, etc.)= more NOUNS, everywhere!\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BJcF8D6Nn.jpg)\n\n## Project Details\n\nThe NFT Yearbook is a pioneering project that combines the physical and digital realms of art and literature. This 420-page coffee table book, weighing in at 6.9 lbs, captures the web3 narrative from the perspective of those who are actively building it. It is also available as a 3D digital readable yearbook, enhancing the experience of the readers.\n\nOver 550 artists, collectors, founders, creators, and community members, many from NOUNSDAO, are featured in this comprehensive collection. The book is a testament to the vibrancy and diversity of the web3 community, serving as a historical record of the NFT space till 2022.\n\nOur team has spent over 750 hours recording interviews, providing a wealth of insights and experiences. Additionally, each interviewee was given the opportunity to nominate other participants. This democratic approach to curation ensures that the final product is a true reflection of the community's diversity and inclusivity.\n\nThe NFT Yearbook is more than just a static record. It's a participatory project that invites engagement from its readers. A unique feature of the book is the opportunity for all holders to submit content for a blank space, making it a truly community-curated project.\n\n\n**The Team**\nThe book is created and published by Metaverse Publishing, a new bootstraped web3 company lead by co-founders @CryptoForager81, (Sol Fayerman-Hansen) the ex head of innovation at the Bank of Montreal and active in blockchain since 2014, and, @CryptoDashi (Dan Stern) who has 10 years of experience in e-Commerce entrepreneurship and DTC experiences creation.\nBoth have been degening since 2017. \nThe third co-founder of Metaverse publishing is a storied IRL coffee table book publisher with 30-years of experience and 300+ physical coffee table books produced, printed and shipped globally -Global Village Publishing.\n\n**Metaverse Publishing**\nThe NFT Yearbook is our first step, our contribution to this space.\nThis unique web3 + in-house IRL publishing capability positions Metaverse Publishing to create some real dope sh*t, and it all starts with The NFT Yearbook.\n\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HyfUUwT4h.jpg)\n\n## Market Validation\n\nThe NFT Yearbook project has already demonstrated its appeal and relevance within the community. In just a short span of time, we've managed to attract a passionate, dedicated community that actively participates in the project's development.\n\nThe project's notability extends beyond our community. The NFT Yearbook has been recognized by prestigious institutions, including Harvard University, which has included the yearbook in its library collection. This validation from such a renowned educational institution emphasizes the yearbook's cultural and academic significance.\n\nThe community's response has been overwhelmingly positive, with active engagement and enthusiasm for the project. NOUNS DAO members have been integral to the project, participating in decisions, suggesting ideas, and contributing content.\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rySrovaEn.jpg)\n\n\n## Goals and Milestones\nHere are our specific goals and milestones:\n\n1. **Finalize the book design with NOUNS DAO:** With the funding, we aim to finalize the design of the book, incorporating the NOUNS DAO community's feedback and ensuring the highest quality. The NFT Yearbook is complete outside of NOUNS DAO content.\n   \n2. **Production:** Upon design finalization, we'll move into production. Each NFT Yearbook comes in digital and physical form, each beautifully bound and printed to the highest standards.\n\n3. **Distribution:** Once the yearbooks are printed, we will handle distribution. We aim to distribute the yearbooks to strategic libraries (two libraries at Harvard have already collected the book and will will be placed in their permanent archives), institutions, and individuals around the world, thereby spreading the influence and reach of our community's creative output. For any NOUNS that do not wish to receive their physical books to their address (anons), they will have the option of allowing us to place their books wherever they would like them...schools, libraries, hotels, etc.\n\n4. **Community Engagement:** As a key part of our mission, we will continue to engage our community in the development and refinement of the NFT Yearbook project. This includes seeking their input on design, content, and distribution strategies.\n\n5. **Placing 100 Limited Edition NOUNS Cover Yearbooks In Strategic Libraries / Museums :** With the funding of this prop, Metaverse Publishing will print ( and create the NFTs ) of 100 NOUNS cover NFT Yearbooks and place them in Strategic libraries and institutions. We'll start with Harvard Business School which already collected 2 NFT Yearbooks for their permanent libraries. We'll seek the communities support and recommendations to assist with this important mission. \n\n6. **Future Editions:** Securing this funding will help set the foundation for the production of future editions of the NFT Yearbook, ensuring that this becomes a tradition within our community, celebrating and documenting our achievements each year with NOUNS as a central figure in the future publications.\n\n7. **NOUNS 3D books** The NFT Yearbook will revolutionize NOUNSDAO book projects (past and future) by transforming them into interactive 3D readable books that can be minted, have AR and VR capabilities, can be read in virtual worlds, etc. \n\n8. **Open-source / free tools** We will give all NOUNSDAO community first access to our open-source and free 3D book creation software, which empowers artists and authors to create immersive and interactive books, enabling them to bring their stories to life in a captivating three-dimensional environment.\n\nSee The latest sample here: https://player.vimeo.com/video/826536881  and note that the layout displayed is not final.\n\n## The Impact\n→ Spreading the love: NOUNS will enter up to 3,075 new homes + 100 major, strategic public locations, worldwide.\n\n→ NOUNS and the NFT Yearbook go to Harvard Business School + 100 libraries / museums / galleries / schools...forever!\nThe NFTYB was collected by 2 libraries in Harvard Business School and once printed, will be placed in Baker Library and the main Harvard library on campus. Plus, we will reserve 10 additional units to be collected by future libraries/archives.\n\n→ Supporting the largest-ever chronicling of the Space , and contributing to this historical project.\n\n→ Supporting an innovative bootstrapped web3 company, seeking to spearhead publishing 3.0 and empower the next gen of creators of web3.\n\n→ Create a new experience for past and future books supported by the DAO. We’re working on making all Metaverse Publishing books compatible in online galleries, VR and AR platforms, as well as metaverse platforms (for example, OnCyber).\n\n\n## Project Timeline\n\nNFT Yearbook Timeline:\n\nInterviews: Completed prior to the timeline start.\nWriting of the Book: Completed prior to the timeline start.\nPublic Sale: Completed prior to the timeline start.\n\nRemaining Tasks:\n\n**Completion of Community Content (May 2023):**\nMay 1-28, 2023: Gather and review community submissions (including NOUNSDAO).\nMay 16-25, 2023: Samples - Quality control checks and adjustments, if necessary.\nMay 28-31, 2023: Incorporate the community content into the book and prepare the finalized book layout for printing.\n\n**Physical Printing of the Books (June/July 2023):**\nJune 1-30, 2023: Print the NFT Yearbook.\n\n**Shipping (End of July 2023):**\nJuly 3-16, 2023: Prepare for shipping, including packaging and labeling.\nJuly 17, 2023: Open physical claim and begin shipping the NFT Yearbooks to customers.\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/H1hTTPp43.jpg)\n\n\n## Budget Breakdown\n\n**The total budget for the NFT Yearbook project is 88.6815 ETH**\n\nHere's how it will be allocated:\n\n**Commission for NOUNS Limited Edition Cover:**\nA total of 3 ETH will be allocated for commissioning an artist, voted by NOUNS Prop House to create three different versions of the limited edition cover.\n\n**Production and Delivery of Books:** The rest of the funds, which total 88.6815 ETH, will be allocated to Metaverse Publishing for the production and delivery of the NFT Yearbooks.

By incorporating NOUNS DAO into this historical chronicle and funding the placment of 100 books in strategic libraries around the world, we are not only recognizing the significant role of the DAO and its members in shaping the web3 landscape, but we are also furthering our commitment to diversity, equality, inclusivity and building a community driven narrative of the amazing world of web3.\n\nThe proposed budget of 88.6815 ETH will enable the production and delivery of a limited edition NFT Yearbook featuring a unique NOUNS DAO cover, both in digital and physical formats and placing an additional 100 NOUNS NFT Yearbooks in strategic locations around the world. This endeavor will help NOUNS DAO to have a tangible and lasting impact, reaching up to 3,075 new homes worldwide, and even prestigious institutions like Harvard Business School.\n\nBy supporting this project, NOUNS DAO will contribute to an important historical project, while also paving the way for the future of publishing in the web3 space. The NFT Yearbook not only represents a snapshot of the current state of the NFT community, but it also serves as a vision of what the community can accomplish in the future.\n\nWe appreciate your consideration of this proposal and look forward to the opportunity of working with NOUNS DAO on this significant project.\n\nTransaction summary: 88.6815 Ξ to:\n0x6029Db0Ea27F7e71Fcc9FfAe8e31C99A46626511","proposer":"0xCEEd9585854F12F81A0103861b83b995A64AD915","startBlock":17501220,"endBlock":17537220,"executed":false},"votes":[]},{"prop":{"id":310,"description":"# Nounish Animations for Kids on YouTube Channel\n\nWe propose to create a YouTube channel that features Nounish musical animations for kids.

We invite you to read our full proposal for comprehensive details.\n\n## What We've Done During This Term\n\nWe spent most of our time and energy (by far) on the upcoming [**DAO V3**](https://twitter.com/eladmallel/status/1661510219342524417?s=20) upgrade:\n\n1. Designing [Nouns Fork](https://mirror.xyz/0x10072dfc23771101dC042fD0014f263316a6E400/iN0FKOn_oYVBzlJkwPwK2mhzaeL8K2-W80u82F7fHj8).\n2. Merging it into the original V3 scope.\n3. Testing this version and getting it audited by [Spearbit](https://spearbit.com/) and [code4rena](https://nouns.wtf/vote/302).\n\nOther projects:\n* Led the [private voting research mandated round](https://prop.house/nouns/private-voting-research-sprint), which we believe so far to be successful in making Nouns interesting to other Ethereum and zk folks; we hope to preserve this momentum in the near future.\n* Shipped [Nouns Streamer](https://twitter.com/davidbrai/status/1625215669582147585).\n* Landed on an Airdrop design through [a Snapshot vote](https://snapshot.org/#/nouns.eth/proposal/0xebe4aec5b96dc5c008902da341bcd4936f5aa09baf73daaa545259183b203089).\n* Gave [a talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw_GU6Gs81o) at ETH Denver.\n\n\nFor even more context, [see our previous proposal](https://nouns.wtf/vote/192).\n\n## Retrospective\n\n### On Communication\n\n**TL;DR: We should over-communicate our decisions and our status.**\n\nWorking for the DAO means addressing diverse stakeholders and their varied views, and dealing with new members unfamiliar with past discussions or decisions. While it's impossible to appease everyone, we aim to strike a balance between involving voters and maintaining autonomy to execute tasks efficiently.\n\nIn our current term we revived [our Snapshot account](https://snapshot.org/#/nouns.eth/) and involved the DAO in choosing its favorite \"airdrop\" design, and in confirming our sense that most Nouns wanted the fork to get shipped ASAP. We will continue to use this communication channel whenever we identify a decision important enough to ask for such attention.\n\nDespite our intention to keep the DAO informed, we've heard that some feel out of the loop, and some are concerned about how and why decisions were made.\n\nMoving forward, we'll prioritize frequent communication about our projects, rationale, and key decisions. We'll use varied formats like blog posts and Twitter discussions to update and receive feedback or ideas to optimize our service to the DAO.\n\n### On Organization\n\nDecentralization, or resilience, seems very important to the DAO. Many voters want to ensure Nouns does not have a single point of failure anywhere, so Nouns may live long and prosper forever(ish). And we've heard some concerns saying we could be doing more on this front.\n\nSo we've been wondering: how might we get more talented builders creating software for/with Nouns? How can we have more parallel processing in areas like smart contracts and other infrastructure needs, much like the success we've had with the governance clients and private voting mandated rounds? And how can we design process and tech to become more resilient and unstoppable?\n\nWe don't have a fully worked-out answer to these questions, but we're curious to try different ideas in this vein. Some questions on our minds:\n\n* How might we better incentivize multiple autonomous teams to contribute smart contracts to Nouns?\n* How might we create more collaborations with top crypto teams?\n* What should be the future of nouns.wtf? Sunset or maintained as an important reference client? and if maintained, by whom?\n* What are distributed work practices we can adopt from others like the Ethereum Foundation and its collaboration with the various client teams?\n\nWe believe figuring all this out can be instrumental in positioning Nouns as a leader in the Ethereum space, and one of the most attractive places to join as a Nouner, builder, delegate or fan.\n\n\n## What's Next\n\nWe expect technical work to continue taking up the vast majority of our time and energy; this term we plan to spend more time than before on proliferation of Nouns tech and collaboration with more tech teams.\n\n### Technical\n\nWe're sharing below our current plan, and emphasizing again that it's absolutely subject to change as we learn more doing the work, or if community members share ideas that are worth changing priorities for.\n\n#### Follow-Through\n\nWe hope these items won't take up much time, but making it clear that as long as these items need our attention, they are top priority.\n\n1. **Art storage compatibility break**: in the next Ethereum upgrade [EIP-3540](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3540) should go into effect. This change means our current art contract will not be able to store new art, while it can still read existing art. We will come up with a plan to handle this change.\n2. **DAO V3**: monitor this version on mainnet, be around for questions and any bug fixing that may arise.\n3. **Fork DAOs frontend**: for forks to have UI for governance and auction, a minor modification of the nouns.wtf code.\n4. **Private voting**: help the DAO crystalize learnings from this prop house round, and decide how to proceed.\n\n#### High Priority\n\nThese projects get us really excited. We would start on these as soon as V3 is live and the above musts are in good shape.\n\n1. **Nouns Governor**\n   Nouns DAO was launched as a fork of Compound Governor Bravo, and to this day remains similar in key aspects. Since then a lot has changed, the DAO landscape has evolved, and here specifically at Nouns we're hitting some walls continuing to rely on the original design. It's time to go back to first principles.\n   \n   The foundation of this new governor design is using NFT-based voting. In today's design voters have a numeric votes balance, an inheritance from Compound's ERC20-based DAO. A Nouns design would be NFT-based, where NFTs are the voters rather than wallets. Some of the benefits of NFT-based voting:\n   * No more snapshot block confusion.\n   * Granular delegation, one Noun at a time.\n   * Fork V2 (see below).\n   * Token owners can override their delegate's vote.\n   * and more.\n   \n   Other changes we're considering are too raw to articulate here; they will be part of our preliminary research, and will be communicated to the community as soon as possible.\n2. **Collaborations with other teams**\n   We'd like to work with leading teams in their fields, to help move the needle for Nouns and the DAO ecosystem. Key examples are:\n   * **Private voting**: work with leading zk teams (likely from the first mandated round) towards building experimental private voting governors on mainnet.\n   * **L2 voting**: collaborate with leading teams to experiment with voting on L2.\n   \n   We will explore additional collaboration opportunities as well, including other teams building governance smart contracts.\n\n#### Medium Priority\n\nBig projects:\n\n1. **Fork V2**\n   The full scope of improvements requires further research. We can say we're hoping to mitigate the current flaw where a majority can follow a forking minority into their fork, making the fork DAO yet another bad environment for the forkers; a solution we have in mind involves NFT-based voting, or other technical approaches that were out of scope for this first version.\n2. **Rank-choice proposals**\n   A long-standing favorite of ours we deemed less urgent so far; it can enable builders to offer multiple variations of their project in a single onchain proposal, hitting more optimal DAO<>builder agreements faster.\n   \nSmaller projects:\n\n3. **Tip governance clients**\n   We're super excited about this one! the idea is for the DAO to send ETH to governance clients' wallets the more they generate votes and proposals onchain, to better incentivize them to create the best UX and features for voters and proposers, and have long-term sustainability.\n5. **Undo vote**\n   Like Gmail's undo send shortly after you send an email, only for votes, to help people fix their voting mistakes (yes, they are still happening).\n\n#### Low Priority\n\n1. AuctionHouse V2: mainly introduces a new onchain price history feed. The project is already coded, next we'll need to run more tests and get it audited.\n2. [Airdrops](https://snapshot.org/#/nouns.eth/proposal/0xebe4aec5b96dc5c008902da341bcd4936f5aa09baf73daaa545259183b203089): we would follow the DAO's choice to build a Nouns Buyer contract. \n3. DAO-controlled multisigs: a Gnosis Safe extension such that multisigs created for Nouns proposals will include the DAO as an admin that can execute arbitrary transactions from those Safes.\n4. Streamer frontend: a web client showing all streams created by the DAO, allowing recipients to view and withdraw from their streams, and allowing Nouns voters to propose to cancel any open stream.\n\n\n### Proliferation & Collaboration\n\nWe would like to do more in this area than we've done so far, while still dedicating the vast majority of our time to the technical projects mentioned above.\n\nSome examples on our mind:\n\n* Github repo house cleaning, for forkers and community members to easily use\n* Initiate new collaborations with well-known teams, as mentioned above.\n* Create more compelling content about Nouns tech, e.g. by working with Nounish.\n* Research ways to onboard more autonomous solidity teams, e.g. incentivize and fund teams to create alternative governor contracts.\n\nWe believe a multi-governor future can be exciting, however this vision isn't clear enough yet to elaborate in this proposal. We'd like to continue discussing this vision with other token holders and community members who feel excited about it.\n\n## Compensation & Terms\n\n* 6 month engagement starting August 1, 2023.\n* Payment done via streams controlled by the DAO, cancelable via proposal.\n* $37.5k per person (2) per month (6) paid in USDC.\n* 3 ETH per month to Solimander, for time spent meeting with the team, reviewing designs and code, and supporting audits and rollout.\n* Total: 450,000 USDC, 18 ETH.\n* Additional funding for things like audits, mandated rounds and other experiments will be requested separately as needs arise.\n\n---\n\nFor any questions, we're available on the NCD discord server and on twitter.\n\n\n[david](https://twitter.com/davidbrai) & [elad](https://twitter.com/eladmallel)\nverbs team ⌐◨-◨","proposer":"0xE26D78c6bFF297Bbc2dA3f80FEA9a42028a4260F","startBlock":17517082,"endBlock":17553082,"executed":true},"votes":[{"support":1,"voter":"0x3B60e31CFC48a9074CD5bEbb26C9EAa77650a43F","numberOfVotes":2,"reason":"Nouns smart contracts and infrastructure are a Public Luxury.

The DAO decides that it wants to make some changes, and then solicits quotes or runs a prop house for ideas on how to implement the change. \n2. Teams make direct proposals to the DAO on code changes *they* think should be made, and the DAO funds them to work on it. \n\nIn either case, I think the DAO should be driving changes and should generally be voting on a per feature basis. \n\nI dislike funding teams in an open ended way for a few reasons\n1. I think it becomes unclear to outsiders what is and isn't being worked on, and how they can get involved. Anything important to the DAO will be taken on by a funded team with an open mandate. Which in a way is great: talented people are ready to work on stuff! But I also think can feel like capture of the codebase.  \n2. I am not sure how much the DAO code should be changing, and on what frequency. If teams are funded to work on stuff, they’ll find stuff to do, but it’s not guaranteed that the DAO would vote to have each of those things worked on, if it was up to them. \n3. Finally, it often ends up that features get bundled together in updates, and it makes it hard for DAO members to make voting decisions. \n\nThat all said, there are practicalities at play. Most good devs want some stability. They do not want to need to get funding feature to feature. And also, due to the nature of how smart contracts are developed, it is efficient to bundle things into a single audit. \n\nSo, to the case at hand. With Verbs we have great devs, who have been with Nouns nearly since the start, and have done great work. The pay is high, but is on par for staff engineer levels of salary + equity, and I think high pay is to be expected for the uncertain nature of this job (will you get funded again in six months?) and the lack of things like health benefits. \n\nI read this proposal and think it mostly falls in category (2) above—“Teams make direct proposals to the DAO on code changes *they* think should be made, and the DAO funds them to work on it.” I think an NFT-first governor is important, I think seeing through the Fork is important, tips to governance clients, undo votes, and price oracle would be nice to have!\n\nSo, I think we have a good thing going and I think it makes sense to fund the development of the work proposed. I know Verbs team is highly interested in figuring out the best way to develop the DAO, so I look forward to working with them to figure this all out! \n\nAs a small practical suggestion, I wonder if we could start the practice of allowing the DAO to vote on each feature included in an audit, and possibly even just reserve an audit slot every six months that many teams can get code into? \n\nThanks David and Elad for all you do!\n\n*sent from voter.wtf*"},{"support":2,"voter":"0x2A019853a00CA3Af202c262076Da3308f606277F","numberOfVotes":2,"reason":"Our abstention vote is not a sign of disapproval, but rather a reflection of our principle of never casting a vote in favor.

HOWEVER, we haven't been able to really utilize droposals at an internet pace well yet b/c the two week process of getting a prop onchain and then it getting through just breaks the whole vibe. but there is no reason that the droposal props need two weeks worth of rigor. it doesn't ask for funding. it doesn't change the smart contracts. it should be a separate governor that has let's say a 30% threshold (or whatever we think is enough to make something canon) and whenever that threshold is met the droposal goes through and nouns' provenance stamp lands on the OE mint. that should be possible on a moments notice as long as enough voters agree.\n\nonce we break out of the idea of a single governor then a number of these bottleneck issues or code base capture issues that have been raised can also be lessoned. different teams can be working on different governors. we can also just try something that would otherwise feel impossibly contentious. like once private voting is ready, we probably shouldn't argue about whether the main governor should adopt it. we should just deploy a governor with private voting, send a minimal amount of dao funds to it, then see what that experience is like!\n\nof course there should be commonalities between governors. if the verbs team builds out the NFT-first nouns governor as they propose here, then it would be best for everyone to share that base (and fork from there) so that the governance clients can easily support the multiple governors. but I think increasingly the real value prop of the verbs team might be in defining that base and evolving that base where a lot of experimentation can still occur by other teams from all the forks that serve different functions / experiments. excited for a multi governor world for nouns!

This can effectively communicate important information to everyone in the DAO, including non-coders. \nAgreeing with what Wilson said earlier. \nI'll take this opportunity to also say that, whether it is code or content, I would be much happier voting for features or deliverables that represent a certain amount of time, rather than voting for open-ended terms or retainer contracts that include deliverables.

It is the largest democratically populated chronicling of the NFT space, and with the support of the NOUNSDAO, we aim to spread the word of web3, NOUNS, and cryptoart around the world, claiming our shared narrative and telling the story of web3 through the eyes of those building it.\n\nThe project has chronicled the web3 narrative from the very beginning to 2022, featuring contributions from over 550 artists, collectors, founders, creators, and community members through a democratic nomination process. The yearbook is a valuable resource for anyone interested in learning more about the history and future of web3.\n\nWe believe that NOUNSDAO is a perfect fit for supporting the NFT Yearbook project. The DAO is a community of dedicated web3 enthusiasts who are passionate about spreading the word about this new technology. With the DAO's support, we can reach a wider audience and make a greater impact.\n  \n\nIn collaboration with NOUNSDAO, we propose:\na) Adding the NOUNS DAO logo, visuals, and content to all 3000 NFT Yearbooks.\nb) Creating a limited edition NFT Yearbook with a custom NOUNS cover, to be airdropped to all NOUNS holders.\nc) Printing and strategically placing 100 additional custom NOUNSDAO NFT Yearbooks around the world in strategic libraries / museums such as Harvard Business School, which has already collected 2 NFT Yearbooks for its libraries and permanent archives.\n\nThe total cost for this proposal is 88.6815 Ξ\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/B163wP6Eh.jpg)\n\n## Introduction\n\nThe NFT Yearbook project has captured a snapshot of the rapidly evolving web3 landscape. It's a comprehensive 420-page, 6.9lbs coffee table book, and a 3D digital readable. It spotlights over 550 artists, collectors, founders, creators, and community members, including many NOUNS fam.\nLink to participants list: https://twitter.com/i/lists/1559260935520411650 \n\nThroughout the past year, we've accumulated over 750 hours of recorded interviews, encapsulating the web3 narrative from the perspectives of those actively shaping it.\n\nA notable aspect of our project is its community-driven nature. The book was co-written and co-curated by the community. Each interviewee nominated other participants for the book, ensuring diversity, equality, and inclusivity.\n\nWe've also introduced a unique feature to increase engagement: blank content spaces as rarity traits. These spaces allow random NFT holders to contribute to the final version of the book, both digital and physical.\n\n\n[![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HJHoroBDn.png)](https://player.vimeo.com/video/826545378)\n\n\n*A 1/1 cover created by 0xDariush*\n\nBeing a 100% bootstrapped and small team, we've strived to ensure that all artists involved in the project can profit from their contributions by creating a 1:1 cover for the book, auctioned on SuperRare, with 100% of the profits returning to the artists.\n\nIn a month and a half, our [1/1 sales](https://superrare.com/series/0x1e3eac91085df57b4aa417b1471349d0bdb19152) have reached 58.150Ξ. Moreover, three artists were invited to SuperRare thanks to the NFT Yearbook project. 79 artists participated in the 1/1 covers and our all-time high sale was 10ETH by thr33som3s.\n\nOur main collection of NFT Yearbooks is hosted on OpenSea, and we've sold 1277 units out of the 3000 total, to date.\n\nWe're proud to announce that the NFT Yearbook was already collected by libraries at Harvard University/HBS, and the books will be placed in their permanent archives. This opportunity would place a NOUNS DAO limited edition cover yearbook in two of the most significant academic libraries globally, cementing its cultural significance.\n\nWith this proposal, we aim to increase the reach of the NOUNSDAO with the historically important content of the NFT Yearbook, to an additional 100 locations worldwide (famed libraries, galleries, etc.)= more NOUNS, everywhere!\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BJcF8D6Nn.jpg)\n\n## Project Details\n\nThe NFT Yearbook is a pioneering project that combines the physical and digital realms of art and literature. This 420-page coffee table book, weighing in at 6.9 lbs, captures the web3 narrative from the perspective of those who are actively building it. It is also available as a 3D digital readable yearbook, enhancing the experience of the readers.\n\nOver 550 artists, collectors, founders, creators, and community members, many from NOUNSDAO, are featured in this comprehensive collection. The book is a testament to the vibrancy and diversity of the web3 community, serving as a historical record of the NFT space till 2022.\n\nOur team has spent over 750 hours recording interviews, providing a wealth of insights and experiences. Additionally, each interviewee was given the opportunity to nominate other participants. This democratic approach to curation ensures that the final product is a true reflection of the community's diversity and inclusivity.\n\nThe NFT Yearbook is more than just a static record. It's a participatory project that invites engagement from its readers. A unique feature of the book is the opportunity for all holders to submit content for a blank space, making it a truly community-curated project.\n\n\n![](https://nftyearbook.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Video_23-02-05_12-13-53-2.gif)\n\n**The Team**\nThe book is created and published by Metaverse Publishing, a new bootstrapped web3 company lead by co-founders @CryptoForager81, (Sol Fayerman-Hansen) the ex-head of innovation at the Bank of Montreal and active in blockchain since 2014, and, @CryptoDashi (Dan Stern) who has 10 years of experience in e-Commerce entrepreneurship and DTC experiences creation.\nBoth have been degening since 2017. \nThe third co-founder of Metaverse Publishing is a storied IRL coffee table book publisher with 30-years of experience and 300+ physical coffee table books produced, printed and shipped globally -Global Village Publishing.\n\n**Metaverse Publishing**\nThe NFT Yearbook is our first step, our contribution to this space.\nThis unique web3 + in-house IRL publishing capability positions Metaverse Publishing to create some real dope sh*t, and it all starts with The NFT Yearbook.\n\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HyfUUwT4h.jpg)\n\n## Market Validation\n\nThe NFT Yearbook project has already demonstrated its appeal and relevance within the community. In just a short span of time, we've managed to attract a passionate, dedicated community that actively participates in the project's development.\n\nThe project's notability extends beyond our community. The NFT Yearbook has been recognized by prestigious institutions, including Harvard University, which has included the yearbook in its library collection. This validation from such a renowned educational institution emphasizes the yearbook's cultural and academic significance.\n\nThe community's response has been overwhelmingly positive, with active engagement and enthusiasm for the project. NOUNS DAO members have been integral to the project, participating in decisions, suggesting ideas, and contributing content.\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rySrovaEn.jpg)\n\n\n## Goals and Milestones\nHere are our specific goals and milestones:\n\n1. **Finalize the book design with NOUNS DAO:** With the funding, we aim to finalize the design of the book, incorporating the NOUNS DAO community's feedback and ensuring the highest quality. The NFT Yearbook is complete outside of NOUNS DAO content.\n   \n2. **Production:** Upon design finalization, we'll move into production. Each NFT Yearbook comes in digital and physical form, each beautifully bound and printed to the highest standards.\n\n3. **Distribution:** Once the yearbooks are printed, we will handle distribution. We aim to distribute the yearbooks to strategic libraries (two libraries at Harvard have already collected the book and will be placed in their permanent archives), institutions, and individuals around the world, thereby spreading the influence and reach of our community's creative output. For any NOUNS that do not wish to receive their physical books to their address (anons), they will have the option of allowing us to place their books wherever they would like them...schools, libraries, hotels, etc.\n\n4. **Community Engagement:** As a key part of our mission, we will continue to engage our community in the development and refinement of the NFT Yearbook project. This includes seeking their input on design, content, and distribution strategies.\n\n5. **Placing 100 Limited Edition NOUNS Cover Yearbooks In Strategic Libraries / Museums :** With the funding of this prop, Metaverse Publishing will print ( and create the NFTs ) of 100 NOUNS cover NFT Yearbooks and place them in Strategic libraries and institutions. We'll start with Harvard Business School which has already collected 2 NFT Yearbooks for its permanent libraries. We'll seek the community's support and recommendations to assist with this important mission. \n\n6. **Future Editions:** Securing this funding will help set the foundation for the production of future editions of the NFT Yearbook, ensuring that this becomes a tradition within our community, celebrating and documenting our achievements each year with NOUNS as a central figure in the future publications.\n\n7. **NOUNS 3D books** The NFT Yearbook will revolutionize NOUNSDAO book projects (past and future) by transforming them into interactive 3D readable books that can be minted, have AR and VR capabilities, can be read in virtual worlds, etc. \n\n8. **Open-source / free tools** We will give all NOUNSDAO community first access to our open-source and free 3D book creation software, which empowers artists and authors to create immersive and interactive books, enabling them to bring their stories to life in a captivating three-dimensional environment.\n\n[![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/ByUlBoSv3.png)](https://player.vimeo.com/video/826536881)\n\n\n*The latest sample - the layout displayed is not final*\n\n## The Impact\n→ Spreading the love: NOUNS will enter up to 3,075 new homes + 100 major, strategic public locations, worldwide.\n\n→ NOUNS and the NFT Yearbook go to Harvard Business School + 100 libraries / museums / galleries / schools...forever!\nThe NFTYB was collected by 2 libraries in Harvard Business School and once printed, will be placed in Baker Library and the main Harvard library on campus. Plus, we will reserve 10 additional units to be collected by future libraries/archives.\n\n→ Supporting the largest-ever chronicling of the space, and contributing to this historical project.\n\n→ Supporting an innovative bootstrapped web3 company, seeking to spearhead publishing 3.0 and empower the next gen of creators of web3.\n\n→ Create a new experience for past and future books supported by the DAO. We’re working on making all Metaverse Publishing books compatible in online galleries, VR and AR platforms, as well as metaverse platforms (for example, OnCyber).\n\n\n## Project Timeline\n\nNFT Yearbook Timeline:\n\nInterviews: Completed prior to the timeline start.\nWriting of the Book: Completed prior to the timeline start.\nPublic Sale: Completed prior to the timeline start.\n\nRemaining Tasks:\n\n**Completion of Community Content (May 2023):**\nMay 1-28, 2023: Gather and review community submissions (including NOUNSDAO).\nMay 16-25, 2023: Samples - Quality control checks and adjustments, if necessary.\nMay 28-31, 2023: Incorporate the community content into the book and prepare the finalized book layout for printing.\n\n**Physical Printing of the Books (June/July 2023):**\nJune 1-30, 2023: Print the NFT Yearbook.\n\n**Shipping (End of July 2023):**\nJuly 3-16, 2023: Prepare for shipping, including packaging and labeling.\nJuly 17, 2023: Open physical claim and begin shipping the NFT Yearbooks to customers.\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/H1hTTPp43.jpg)\n\n\n## Budget Breakdown\n\n**The total budget for the NFT Yearbook project is 88.6815 ETH**\n\nHere's how it will be allocated:\n\n**Commission for NOUNS Limited Edition Cover:**\nA total of 3 ETH will be allocated for commissioning an artist, voted by NOUNS Prop House to create three different versions of the limited edition cover.\n\n**Production and Delivery of Books:** The rest of the funds, which total 88.6815 ETH, will be allocated to Metaverse Publishing for the production and delivery of the NFT Yearbooks. This allocation includes:\n- Printing and placing an additional 100 NOUNS Cover NFT Yearbooks in strategic locations, worldwide, starting with Harvard Business School.\n- Cost of producing the digital and physical versions of the NFT Yearbook with the limited edition NOUNS DAO cover.\n- Cost of delivery, which includes worldwide shipping and taxes.\n- The claim for the 6.9lbs physical coffee table book.\n\nThe allocation is based on the public mint price of the book (0.1195 ETH per book), multiplied by the total number of books (717 books).\n\nThe funds will be transferred to the Metaverse Publishing multisig Safe wallet.\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BJjV0w6Nh.jpg)\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe NFT Yearbook project is an innovative initiative to preserve and celebrate the vibrant, diverse, and rapidly evolving web3 community. By incorporating NOUNS DAO into this historical chronicle and funding the placement of 100 books in strategic libraries around the world, we are not only recognizing the significant role of the DAO and its members in shaping the web3 landscape, but we are also furthering our commitment to diversity, equality, inclusivity and building a community driven narrative of the amazing world of web3.\n\nThe proposed budget of 88.6815 ETH will enable the production and delivery of a limited edition NFT Yearbook featuring a unique NOUNS DAO cover, both in digital and physical formats and placing an additional 100 NOUNS NFT Yearbooks in strategic locations around the world. This endeavor will help NOUNS DAO to have a tangible and lasting impact, reaching up to 3,075 new homes worldwide, and even prestigious institutions like Harvard Business School.\n\nBy supporting this project, NOUNS DAO will contribute to an important historical project, while also paving the way for the future of publishing in the web3 space. The NFT Yearbook not only represents a snapshot of the current state of the NFT community, but it also serves as a vision of what the community can accomplish in the future.\n\nWe appreciate your consideration of this proposal and look forward to the opportunity of working with NOUNS DAO on this significant project.\n\n","proposer":"0x8E71bc5B07E7A2B188c50D55E346AFAA208bf7bE","startBlock":17519618,"endBlock":17555618,"executed":false},"votes":[{"support":0,"voter":"0x17a01dB837345772F2E65Adf2fb4f4DE10ac1B72","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x8E71bc5B07E7A2B188c50D55E346AFAA208bf7bE","numberOfVotes":2,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x2A7611E809773540acBC916024e6bdf86023C116","numberOfVotes":0,"reason":""},{"support":0,"voter":"0x4754b7e3DEde42D71d6c92978f25F306176EC7e9","numberOfVotes":7,"reason":""},{"support":0,"voter":"0x5606B493c51316A9e65c9b2A00BbF7Ff92515A3E","numberOfVotes":31,"reason":""},{"support":0,"voter":"0x2561469bC99cfe9628b6A57138B71AA88305Cf90","numberOfVotes":0,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x2ED22eA03fEA3e5BD90f6Fdd52C20c26ff6e1300","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":0,"voter":"0x073f0DC58e9989C827bA5b7b35570B7315652e63","numberOfVotes":2,"reason":""},{"support":0,"voter":"0xbc3ed6B537f2980e66f396Fe14210A56ba3f72C4","numberOfVotes":2,"reason":"I am excited about funding some kind of Nouns zine, perhaps an annual recap, but not super into funding something covering the whole NFT space.

Currently, the DAO is not hedged against the [risks](https://help.lido.fi/en/articles/5230603-what-are-the-risks-of-staking-with-lido) associated with stETH. The DAO can derisk these holdings by purchasing [stETH depeg protection](https://www.cozy.finance/protection-market/0x3b548fbadc2d926adb7e5a5d44d824a1c7f3614d) on Cozy v2 protocol. \n\nBy doing so, NounsDAO will:\n\n- Hedge against protocol risk for stETH\n- Enable the DAO to execute transactions on L2, starting with Optimism\n\nBoth of these outcomes will help the DAO proliferate Nouns. The former protects the income generating portion of the treasury. The latter establishes a NounsDAO footprint on a lower fee environment chain, increasing accessibility.\n\nAs a starting point, the DAO could protect $1M worth of stETH for roughly 12 ETH. This protection would cost an estimated 1.5% APR, compared to staking yields of 4-6% APR. There’s also a one-time cost of $4k to audit the contracts required to buy the protection on Optimism.  \n\n## Cozy Protection\n\nHere’s how Cozy protection works:\n\n1. Buy protection tokens from the stETH depeg market\n2. If stETH depegs below 50%, the market “triggers” enabling protection token holders to claim a payout\n\nSo if something bad happens to stETH causing a 50%+ depeg, the DAO can recoup its losses based on how much protection it holds.\n\nYou can learn more [here](https://www.cozy.finance/) and in the [docs](https://www.notion.so/1272a15348dc481b9de0e29a33b81c04?pvs=21).\n\n## NounsDAO on Optimism\n\nTo buy protection on the Cozy protocol, the DAO needs a way to execute transactions on Optimism. The DAO can use a proxy contract deployed to Optimism, “L1Proxy,” to execute transactions.\n\nThe DAO on L1 would execute transactions on L1Proxy by sending messages through [Optimism messengers](https://community.optimism.io/docs/developers/bridge/messaging/) from L1. L1Proxy has an `owner` role which would be the DAO address on L1, and has an authed function which checks [xDomainMessageSender](https://community.optimism.io/docs/developers/bridge/messaging/#accessing-msg-sender) == `owner` that can execute arbitrary transactions. \n\nOnce deployed, the DAO would be able to fund the L1Proxy by using a bridge like Hop.\n\nYou can review the verified contracts [here]. \n\n## Trustlessly buying protections\n\nOnce the L1Proxy is deployed, the DAO can now execute transactions on L2 from L1. To buy protection from the Cozy protocol, the DAO can use the [tokenbuyer contract](https://github.com/nounsDAO/token-buyer) developed by the Verbs team with a custom pricefeed. The DAO would fund the tokenbuyer with ETH, specify a price (e.g. $2 per $100 of protection, or ~1.5% APR), and a third party can swap protection tokens for ETH at that price. \n\nClick here to review the contracts for the [token buyer](https://github.com/portaldiscovery/cozy-v2-token-buyer) and the [cross-chain proxy](https://github.com/portaldiscovery/optimism-cross-chain-proxy).\n\n## How it works all together\n\n- **Setup:** Deploy L1Proxy and tokenbuyer on Optimism\n- ********************Proposal:******************** Set the purchase price in the tokenbuyer and bridge ETH to the tokenbuyer\n- ********************Followup:******************** Transfer protection tokens from the tokenbuyer to the L1Proxy\n\n![Untitled](https://cozyfinance.notion.site/image/https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fsecure.notion-static.com%2F368d12be-ce44-4b5b-a0e1-5c94020539f3%2FUntitled.png?id=a93f5bc8-605f-4728-8fad-fcf160832739&table=block&spaceId=2f87461d-478a-4b6b-8c56-3d60c2901f5c&width=1440&userId=&cache=v2)\n\n## How this proliferates Nouns\n\nFunding proposals using the treasury is the singular proliferation mechanism for Nouns. Balancing income generation with risk management is essential for the long term viability of this mechanism. Showing that the DAO can earn income on treasury assets and hedge risk strengthens the DAO’s ability to continue funding proliferation. \n\nCozy can also be used to protect other LSDs like Rocketpool ETH. Managing protocol risk for other LSDs could make it easier for the DAO to diversify. \n\nFurther, the newly established footprint on L2 opens up exciting possibilities to expand Nouns to lower cost chainspace, increasing accessibility to a more mass market audience.\n\nSome potential use cases include:\n\n- Funding a multisig on optimism to distribute microgrants\n- Open edition mints on Zora\n- Streaming payments\n- On-chain prophouse\n\n## Funding\n\nThe following can be accomplished with 13 ETH and 4000 USDC. \n\n- 4000 USDC for a [Veridise](https://veridise.com/) audit\n- 12 ETH would be used to fund the token buyer. This will all get converted into stETH depeg protection tokens.\n\n## Proposal ops\n\nThis proposal requires two on-chain proposals. The first to audit the two contracts. The second to fund the tokenbuyer that will acquire the Cozy protection.\n\n1. (We are here) Transfer 4000 USDC to Veridise for the audit of the contracts\n2. (Follow up) Transfer 12 ETH to the tokenbuyer, which will get converted into Cozy protection\n\n## Conclusion\n\nFor ~15 ETH, the DAO is getting $1M+ of stETH depeg protection and an address on Optimism that the DAO can control directly through governance. Both outcomes empower the DAO to further proliferate Nouns by funding Nounish projects. \n\nIf you have any questions about the proposal, join this [discussion telegram group](https://t.me/+rfuoI8SkzxdhYjRh).\n\n## FAQs\n\n**How much does protection cost?**\n\nProtection is priced by a bonding curve reflecting supply and demand. The current price is ~$1.4 per $100 of protection and at 80% utilization, the price would be $2. \n\nBecause the DAO will be buying through the tokenbuyer contract, it should set a price slightly above market to create a small arbitrage opportunity, incentivizing third parties to swap.\n\n**How long will protection last?**\n\nProtection on Cozy v2 is perpetual. It decays at a 50% per year. So protection for $1M at the start of the year will cover $500K at the end of the year. \n\n**What’s the APR of the protection?**\n\nThe estimated APR is ~1.5%. \n\nThis value factors in the proceeds of selling back the protection at the end of the year and normalizes for the decay rate. In this example, the DAO could expect to recoup ~$0.9 per $100 of protection initially purchased. And the average protection amount over the course of the year is 75% (the average of 100% and 50%).\n\n**Who will swap protection for ETH in the tokenbuyer?**\n\nBy setting a price in the tokenbuyer that is higher than the current market price on Cozy, the DAO can expect an economically rational third party to take the arbitrage opportunity.","proposer":"0x4754b7e3DEde42D71d6c92978f25F306176EC7e9","startBlock":17530569,"endBlock":17566569,"executed":true},"votes":[{"support":1,"voter":"0x4754b7e3DEde42D71d6c92978f25F306176EC7e9","numberOfVotes":7,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x5606B493c51316A9e65c9b2A00BbF7Ff92515A3E","numberOfVotes":31,"reason":""},{"support":0,"voter":"0x17a01dB837345772F2E65Adf2fb4f4DE10ac1B72","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x6A449469BdA8d6e198c1ebd44531b9C135dA65Ae","numberOfVotes":0,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x852aAbF6CcF5b6f6C991a9b5B283cb9b02423910","numberOfVotes":0,"reason":""},{"support":0,"voter":"0x2ED22eA03fEA3e5BD90f6Fdd52C20c26ff6e1300","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x073f0DC58e9989C827bA5b7b35570B7315652e63","numberOfVotes":2,"reason":""},{"support":0,"voter":"0x00cDa37BfC3Dd20349Aa901Fe8646688218d8772","numberOfVotes":2,"reason":""},{"support":0,"voter":"0x8dA24B480689314C6d217F2D0Bad0DacCC87ff44","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":0,"voter":"0x2A019853a00CA3Af202c262076Da3308f606277F","numberOfVotes":2,"reason":"We object to this proposal, as we see it as a covert governance attack, wasting the time and energy of governance participants.\n\nCozy is a credible-neutrality insurance protocol that we value highly.

For policyholders, this presents a garbage product with a severe imbalance of risk and reward.\n\n2. The second reason comes from the opinion of the proposal researcher: I view this proposal as a covert governance attack.

Conversely, if the underwriter is pricing the insurance premium incorrectly, the buyer may get a good return on their payments, but ultimately runs the risk of counterparty insolvency. In this case, paying over 1% fees sounds cheap until you compound that number for a few years and realize the opportunity cost.\n\nIn execution, I find it odd that we first have to pay to get the contract audited. Are cozy contracts not already audited? If not, why is that something we should cover? It's a little rich for us to pay to verify the veracity of the product we're aiming to purchase itself.

As soon as opportunities for more yield (or alternatively, further hedges) come up, it begins to consume the DAO. Similar to Wilson’s reasoning, if we buy peg protection, what comes next? This is an example of this slippery slope, where techniques gradually grow more and more complicated. Eventually, the complexity grows to the point where it can threaten the security of the DAO’s treasury.

If we wanted peg protection, holding stablecoins would likely be a better hedge, given how much a catastrophic stETH depeg would impact the price of ETH.\n\nI have a lot of respect for the work that Cozy Finance is doing, and I also believe that an audit of the L1Proxy is likely useful for the industry. But I would prefer that those funding requests are separate from treasury management techniques. I am voting No because the slippery slope of treasury management — as much as I like the specific project, I view it as risky to set a precedent of active treasury management and yield/hedge chasing.\n\n*sent from voter.wtf*"},{"support":0,"voter":"0xfc42111bDfF4FCbF5F531286B09875962f389F3D","numberOfVotes":3,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0xeffec2D0163343c8F26983Af1f6684e0b966a6b2","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":0,"voter":"0x1e66a3D0a6A327b1F29e8ACf3a3d9E1E4E088683","numberOfVotes":2,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x6b2645b468A828a12fEA8C7D644445eB808Ec2B1","numberOfVotes":30,"reason":"join a governance pool, learn more at https://federation.wtf"}]},{"prop":{"id":314,"description":"# Retro Fund Voter.wtf\n\n**tl;dr** Retro fund 10 ETH to Wilson Cusack (proposer) for work on Nouns governance client, [voter.wtf](https://www.voter.wtf/).\n___\n*Background*\n*Motivation*\n*Traction*\n*Ask*\n\n## Background\nTwo months ago, I started work on [voter.wtf](https://www.voter.wtf/).

The site currently has no cost overhead: it runs on Vercel free tier and only relies on the Nouns DAO subgraph. \n\n## Motivation\nAside from making the speedy, vote-with-reason-centric client that I myself wanted to use, the meta goal of the project is to help Nouns by\n1. Attempting to encourage vote with reason, so that we can better understand each other's perspectives--developing a sort of \"case law\" for what Nouns *is*--and push Nouns to be the #1 place for thoughtful DAO participants. \n2. Present Nouns DAO as a sort of game that can be played. I call the site a \"Nouns DAO console.\" We don't have exciting prop outcomes to share every week, but we do have proposal drama every week, and that's something! \n\n## Traction\nI am most proud of the feedback I shared above and the mint comments below. I hope we'll see more positive feedback come in the votes. Admittedly, I have been cheap and don't have great site analytics. Here is trailing 30 days from Vercel, however it flatlines when my free-tier usage maxes out 😅.\n![vercel](https://github.com/wilsoncusack/nouns-vote-with-reason/assets/6678357/3d2f8a0e-190e-4c13-b9d9-f3f36a99f8ce)\n\nHere are analytics from another service, which I added on the 15th.\n![pirsch](https://github.com/wilsoncusack/nouns-vote-with-reason/assets/6678357/2992c7c8-dc26-488b-a70f-0254b063e8e8)\n\nVote support went live on the 12th and you can also track some usage via the *sent from voter.wtf* you see in the vote reasons.\n![vwr](https://github.com/wilsoncusack/nouns-vote-with-reason/assets/6678357/b30be812-b0c1-41ca-a4e2-706df91dd893)\n\n\n## Ask\nI am asking for 10 ETH retro funding to compensate, recognize, and appreciate the work so far. If funded, I am hopeful that this can serve as a model to some subset of developers who want to work with the DAO: hack on something on your own time and try to get some traction.

I like the idea of retro-funding, because it self selects for execution oriented builders, and by definition you're verifying someone's extant contribution as opposed to speculating on their eventual delivery. Totally understand that some props require large funding up front to pursue and want to be supportive of those larger capital investments, but I am much more amenable to voting for a retro fund proposal.\n\nPS - I think i'm the first to vote on this one.

Forbes has recognized the platform for its innovative approach to revolutionizing the tennis industry. NTF is now ready to take the next steps in fostering the development of elite tennis talent, enhancing fan engagement, and positioning NounsDAO in front of a global audience of hundreds of millions.\n\nTo achieve these goals, NTF will harness its tennis stars as brand ambassador powerhouses. They will compete in custom NTF Noggles apparel at some of the world's biggest sporting events and actively promote NounsTennisFam through their impressive social media reach. Additionally, NTF will provide a fairer and more transparent on-chain infrastructure for developing elite tennis talent and democratizing the sport.\n\nBy supporting emerging players and enhancing fan engagement, NTF will make a mark on the industry, paving the way for a sustainable ecosystem for talent development, sponsorship opportunities, and interactive experiences. This will leave a legacy and transform NounsTennisFam into a well-known and respected name in the industry.\n\nIn line with NounsDAO's mission of decentralization and community-driven initiatives, NTF will offer a comprehensive suite of resources for professional and aspiring tennis players, including funding, training, and community support. Empowering pros, prospects, and fans and transforming them into a community of benefactors invested in one another's success is the future of sports. Together, let's change the game and establish NounsTennisFam as a major force in professional tennis.\n\n# TL;DR\n\nNounsTennisFam is set to revolutionize the tennis industry through blockchain technology and democratization of the sport by providing fair compensation for investors and talent. With the goal of becoming a cornerstone of the global tennis market valued at $5.6 billion, NounsTennisFam aims to represent athletes and connect fans under the NounsDAO banner in front of millions of fans worldwide.\n\n## Key Objectives\n![](https://i.postimg.cc/3Jn3LBfZ/3.png)\n- Noggles and NounsTennisFam (NTF) branded jerseys to be worn by co-founder Borna Coric (World No 20 Croatian tennis star) in grand slams and other major events, with millions of views and discussions about Nouns and NTF in pre/post-match press conferences.\n- Develop the \"NounsTennisFam\" platform to support up-and-coming athletes by funding them through the issuance of their own digital collectibles, which translates to a portion of the athletes' future game/endorsement earnings.\n- Gain support from athletes such as Real Madrid/Croatian football star Luka Modric, Grand Slam winner Marin Cilic, and others in Borna's network.\n- Provide branded NTF/Noggles competition apparel for all NTF-sponsored athletes, seen by millions.\n- Support underprivileged communities to ensure that economics do not stand in the way of talent.\n- Create new opportunities for fans to interact with sports, invest, and be a part of an athlete's journey from the beginning while learning about web 3 in the process.\n- Establish NounsTennis Fam as a household name in professional sports.\n\nThis collaboration presents a tremendous opportunity for NounsDAO to gain incredible exposure before a global audience and create lasting value for the brand while supporting emerging prospects and established professionals in the tennis industry.\n\n# Opportunity of a Lifetime\n\n## Tennis Viewership Numbers Reveal the Sport's Widespread Appeal and Growing Popularity\n\nMajor tournaments, all of which NTF Co-founder, Borna competes in, attract millions of viewers worldwide. In 2021, Wimbledon reached a global audience of over 500 million viewers, while the French Open and the Australian Open had 350 million and 900 million viewers, respectively (source: Grand Slam Board). This global audience provides a significant opportunity for NounsTennisFam to engage a passionate user base and secure NounsDAO significant exposure before an army of loyal fans.\n\n## Sports on the Blockchain\n\nAccording to Grand View Research, Inc., the global sports market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 3.3% from 2020 to 2027, driven by increasing participation in sports, the rising popularity of sports leagues, and the growing demand for sports-related merchandise. Although this report does not specifically address tennis, a Nielsen Sports report forecasts tennis viewership to continue growing in the United States, fueled by top players' popularity and the rise of new stars like Coco Gauff. The US Open, in particular, has experienced significant growth, with a 33% increase in average audience per match in 2021 compared to the previous year. This suggests the potential for the sport to continue to grow in popularity and reach new audiences, offering a substantial opportunity for NounsDAO to engage with a large audience eager for innovative solutions like the NounsTennisFam platform.\n\n## Success stories\n\n### Tennis Australia\n\nTennis Australia collaborated with the Australian Open to incorporate blockchain technology and NFTs into the event. The final bounce of winning points was linked to corresponding NFTs known as \"Artballs.\" Fans owning these NFTs won various rewards, such as tickets to the next year's tournament. The Australian Open also utilized the metaverse, creating a replica of the Rod Laver Arena in Decentraland and engaging with millions of users in a Roblox experience. These initiatives led to increased viewership and fan engagement, demonstrating the potential of blockchain technology in sports.\n\n### NBA Top Shot\n\nNBA Top Shot is a blockchain-based platform that allows fans to buy, sell, and trade officially licensed NBA collectible highlights (NFTs). Its success factors include a strategic partnership with the NBA, a user-friendly platform, and scarcity-driven value of collectibles.\n\n### Socios.com\n\nSocios.com is a blockchain-based fan engagement platform for sports teams. Its success factors include partnerships with top-tier football clubs, fan token offerings (FTOs), and voting rights for fans on certain club decisions.\n\nThese examples exhibit incredible potential for blockchain technology to revolutionize fan engagement, sports financing, and brand name recognition.\n\n## Key Benefits of Collaboration\n\n### Team and Experience\n\nBoasting Ivy League graduates, professional athletes, proven entrepreneurs, and Web3 experts, the NounsTennisFam team is prepared to catapult NounsDAO into the professional tennis spotlight as a fresh, inventive, and distinguished new brand.\n\n![](https://i.postimg.cc/mZzdHWfk/Screen-Shot-2023-06-07-at-1-04-23-am.png)\n\n| [Co-founder Borna Ćorić](https://www.atptour.com/en/players/borna-coric/cg80/overview) | [Co-founder & CCO Bruna Ćorić](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bruna-%C4%87ori%C4%87-916784b5/) | [Co-founder & CEO Bruno Pliso](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bruno-pliso-1a29a6176/) | [Creative Director Nina Turudic](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nikolina-turudic-ab29b4b2/) |\n\n| [Finance & Operations Ivan Turudic](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ivan-turudi%C4%87-18657a155/) | [CTO Karlo Brdek](https://www.linkedin.com/in/karlo-brdek) | [CMO Sven Stanko](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sven-stanko-545751ba/) | NFT Advisor, Dapper VP Fran Brajcic | [Web3 Consultant Shan Kumar](http://https://twitter.com/shanicucic96) |\n\n\n# Platform Features and User Experience\n\n![](https://i.postimg.cc/1RNDSMdm/platform.png)\n\nNounsTennisFam platform offers a range of features designed to create a transparent, fair, and sustainable ecosystem to attract and connect tennis pros, new talent, and fans. \n\n1. **Platform & Launchpad:** The platform uses blockchain technology to establish a secure and transparent infrastructure to support emerging tennis talent.

Professional player valuations are based on historical performance data and a proprietary model, while prospect valuations involve negotiations and selection for either a Prospect pool or a Player exclusive drop, guided by the expertise of Kozmos Holding.\n\nTogether, NounsTennisFam and NounsDAO can actively support emerging tennis superstars by addressing one of their most significant challenges–funding, while providing a framework for established professionals to enter the Web3 space through fractionalized earnings. This approach will strengthen our brand and further democratizes the sport of tennis. Additionally, this collaboration will place NounsTennisFam at the forefront of a vast global tennis market, valued at $5.6 billion in 2019 (Source: ITF). Notably, 46% of global tennis fans have a household income of $75,000 or more (Source: ITF), representing a demographic well-suited to become NounsDAO community members.\n\n# Existing Partnerships and Collaborations\n\nNounsTennisFam has already established integral strategic partnerships with tennis academies, professional players, sport management giants, and Web3 projects that enhance the platform’s features and user experience. Our collaborations within the tennis industry allow us to tap into the impressive viewership numbers of events, such as the Wimbledon 2019, with a peak audience of 9.6 million viewers in the UK alone (Source: BBC), and the French Open 2020 final, with a peak audience of 3.3 million viewers in France (Source: SportsPro). \n\nThese partnerships provide credibility and enable NounsTennisFam to engage with tennis fans and connect with Web3 natives through our blockchain partners.

[Previous order](https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/low-fi-nounish-noggles-by-bigshot/2103/59) costed $2.40/unit.\n\nWorldwide shipping costs average to $350 per carton of 1000, and we'd make minimum of 25 cartons. \n\n# Total ask for 25K units:\n$57,000 in USDC deposited into the Nounworks projects wallet:\n\n\n[0xd25912007EBC2527d4ED9DC536f928E550b0f02C](https://etherscan.io/address/0xd25912007EBC2527d4ED9DC536f928E550b0f02C)\n\n# Why now?\nTo ensure we can distribute the Noggles worldwide ASAP, we aim to place our order with the printer as soon as possible.\n\n\n# After we ship to Nouns community members: \n\nWarehousing, administrative, and shipping fees TBD after the remainder gets to the USA, handled on a case by case basis. (See next prop which deals with ongoing funding for distribution of Nouns merch to members of the community).\n\nIn general once the unclaimed units get back to our USA warehouse, the cost to turn around and ship them again will be $2 per unit for the Lo-Fi Noggles and $2 more to ship them. They are in packs of 50 so that would be $200 shipped to get a pack of 50 back out to another country. That cost will be covered by the recipients or their props.\n\n# Info about our previous order:\n10K units were paid for by Nouns DAO (NSFW) and an additional 3K units were paid for by Bigshot. All have since been dispersed globally, sold out and gone. All faces wearing Lo-Fi Noggles were happy faces!\n\n# So what's next?\n\nGlad you asked. [We will have a follow-up prop that will fund our ongoing supply of our Nounish merch to members of the Nouns community worldwide](https://hackmd.io/@bigshot/BJSZdHJBh    ). This will complete the proliferation machine and will ensure a constant stream of Nounish merch to the doors of the right organizations.

The story has just started and Nouns will certainly have more than enough screen time of their own alongside Gi (who is also a Noun). Hint - Jaws Hardback isn’t just a mural. “Venture to new worlds, visit other cities!”\n\nTo address Hindsight’s comment:\n- Absolutely important to understand effectiveness of the spend as it further goes down the production timeline. From a content standpoint, Our ultimate goal is to have the movie be seen by a LOT more people through more traditional distribution mechanisms.

No.\nThere will be no DAO for this project. Here's why:\n* There are a LOT of Nouns DAOs, let's build games for those\n* Game selection by DAO vote may not be the best option\n* Better to keep freedom for individual games to have DAOs\n\n### What about running ads in the games?\nRunning annoying ads between levels ruins a lot of good games. But **rewarded ads** and **sponsorships** can work. In-game ads can also **promote other Nouns projects**.\n\nRunning video ads featuring Nouns **in other people's games** is one advertising strategy. Nouns get video views AND game installs.\n\n### What about Tokens and Play-to-Earn?\n**Hot take:** Nouns games should AVOID play-to-earn cryptocurrency models. Gone wrong, they can do more damage to the Nouns brand than good. We don't plan on issuing a token or using play-to-earn tokenomics.\n\n---\n\n# Collabs\n### Games play well with other Nouns projects ...\nDecentralizing games across communities through collabs. This is big.\n\n![Collabs](https://i.imgur.com/zkWUEuI.jpg)\n\n# Future Proposals\n\nObjective is to bring **ambitious gaming proposals** to NounsDAO, for example:\n\n**Games Meets Toys**\nFunding to connect games and toys, loading toys into games, AR features\n\n**Collabs with other Nouns Projects**\nGames x Nouns opens up new opportunities for Nouns communities\n\n**Publishing Games to PC and Consoles**\nPublish games for Mac, PC, Steam, Epic, and consoles (hello Nintendo)\n\n**Game Dev Hackathons**\nFunding for hackathons to create new prototypes and web games\n\n**Scaling Up Nouns Proliferation with Games**\nOnboarding people to Nouns with games, by scaling up successful advertising experiments. Proliferation on demand, to desired audiences, with measurable ROI.\n\n---\n\n# Outcome\n\n### ✅ Nouns Communities get Powered Up\nDecentralized web games for Nouns communities unlock new business models\n\n### ✅ Nouns Solves its Game Funding Problem\nNouns Game Publisher helps NounsDAO make smart investments in games\n\n### ✅ Indie Game Developers Flock to Nouns\nGame publishing pipeline and CC0 toolkit attracts new talent to Nouns\n\n### ✅ Games Get Less Expensive to Market\nA network of Nouns games is less expensive to advertise. For example:\n* Pay for 1 install, games link to 6 games, 7 installs for the price of 1\n* Advertise a games website with 7 games, per-game ad costs reduced by 85%\n* Proliferation efforts for **one** Nouns game helps elevate **all** Nouns games\n\n### ✅ NounsDAO Gets Quality Gaming Proposals ⌐◨-◨\nWhen a new game proposal is brought to the DAO, a game should:\n1. Be playable\n2. Have base metrics\n3. Show promising early results\n\nFunding risk is lower, success is more likely. NounsDAO can **scale up successful games** to proliferate Nouns anywhere in the world.\n\n# Nouns = Open Source Nintendo?\nMushrooms, bombs, stars, clouds ... they *already exist* as Nouns 🤯\n\n[![Nounio Bros](https://i.imgur.com/Y625qy0.gif)](https://nounsgames.wtf)\n\n**Play this prototype** (and more) at [**nounsgames.wtf**](https://nounsgames.wtf) \n# LFGame!\n## Thank you for voting YES on Nouns games 🕹️😁","proposer":"0xcC2688350d29623E2A0844Cc8885F9050F0f6Ed5","startBlock":17577432,"endBlock":17613432,"executed":false},"votes":[{"support":0,"voter":"0xC9A43964B791e5aBd13B98fAc710132AbFCa873E","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":"i'm tired boss"},{"support":0,"voter":"0x7dE92ca2D0768cDbA376Aac853234D4EEd8d8B5C","numberOfVotes":22,"reason":""},{"support":0,"voter":"0x860B328060180b2A14ae5C018AbA2Dd42D7ab6bA","numberOfVotes":16,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0xE8D24bE3ABF6EB27B800F752A969D3C1E84fD401","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":0,"voter":"0x008c84421dA5527F462886cEc43D2717B686A7e4","numberOfVotes":17,"reason":"Pro games in general, too much up front by 10x."},{"support":0,"voter":"0xfc42111bDfF4FCbF5F531286B09875962f389F3D","numberOfVotes":3,"reason":""},{"support":0,"voter":"0x4Bd8649394704817434feFE35042f1F1685bCA4A","numberOfVotes":19,"reason":""},{"support":0,"voter":"0x1db19B9903c5510AA5a866ea643Eb021CD12Bda0","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":"thanks to the people who put forth this well-thought-out idea. i see nouns as a perfect canvas for turning dreams into reality. imo, with nouns, you can create endless possibilities. if building games is your passion, then build the dream game you've always wanted to play.  maybe start small with a basic version of your product, pouring your passion into it. show progress and some degree of PMF. i'm almost sure you'll continue to get funding after an initial MVP prop that generates good results. \n\nwhat does it take to make an awesome game? if there were no limits, how would you go about it? \n\ni'm eagerly waiting for the first nouns-powered game that people can't stop playing. \n\n*sent from voter.wtf*"},{"support":0,"voter":"0x17a01dB837345772F2E65Adf2fb4f4DE10ac1B72","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0xDDF53915051687b0E9638376eD04d4570a11eaF3","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":0,"voter":"0x8ac3ecf6973E020cC0E6e8989Fb71B4a77D65987","numberOfVotes":2,"reason":"Taken from my newsletter - https://paragraph.xyz/@thebower/nouns-dao-active-governance-10\n\nThank you to the proposers for working on this project, I appreciate the time dedicated and the interest in Nouns, but I see some major issues with this proposal.\n\nQuality.

Our team has been hard at work programming Nerman's various bots and libraries since then. Check out [nerman.wtf](https://nerman.wtf) for a summary of the project and links to the various code repositories.\n\nIn this proposal we focus our efforts on Nerman.js ([GitHub](https://github.com/JoeCars/Nerman.js), [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nerman)), and Nounish feeds using our Discord bot ([GitHub](https://github.com/JoeCars/Nerman)).\n\n---\n\n## NERMAN.JS - NOUNS SDK\n\n---\n\nNerman.js provides simple type-safe access to Nouns DAO contract events, as well as custom events such as Noun O'Clock. The user provides a JSON-RPC url and connects directly to an Ethereum node without any further 3rd party hosted services.\n\nYou can install Nerman.js with [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nerman)\n\n**DEMO - NOUN O'CLOCK**\n\n``` typescript\nimport * as nerman from \"nerman\";\n\nconst Nouns = new nerman.Nouns( JSON_RPC_API_URL );\n\nNouns.on(\"AuctionEnd\", (data : nerman.EventData.AuctionEnd) => {\n    \n    // It's Noun O'Clock, do stuff here!!\n\n});\n```\n\nFor more code examples see the ReadMe in [GitHub](https://github.com/JoeCars/Nerman.js). Nerman.js currently supports listening to Nouns DAO events such as auction creation, auction bids, proposal creation, dao votes, Noun creation, Noun transfer, delegation changes, and more. We also launched support for [Nouns Nymz](https://nouns.nymz.xyz/) and have a live feed posting in a Nouns community Discord.\n\n**THE FUTURE**\n\nNerman.js will provide and maintain access to events across the Nouniverse:\n\n- Nouns DAO events across all contracts, including DAO updates (v3) and DAO tools (token buyer)\n- Various events from Nounish projects and tools like Prop House, Nouns Nymz, Federation, Agora, etc. \n- Contract events from Nounish DAOs (Lil Nouns, Gnars, Builder DAO)\n\nNerman.js will index on-chain Nouns data:\n\n- Pre-indexed Nouns data included with library for instant access\n- Manually run the indexer yourself for verification\n- This indexed data allows Nerman to offer more complicated analysis of the data, including reporting behavior of voters, bidders, vote participation rates, etc.\n\nNerman.js will be a canonical source of knowledge about the Nouniverse:\n\n- Our extensive, SEO optimized documentation will help people figure out what Nouns contracts and projects exist and how to best interact with them. Our resources will be a useful starting point for anyone developing in Nouns.\n\n\n---\n\n## DISCORD BOT - NOUNISH FEEDS\n\n---\n\nNerman offers customizable Nounish event feeds for Discord channels, displaying formatted embeds with the main Nouns DAO contract events from Nerman.js. Users can configure which events to display in a channel with a simple command.\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HyX8b1U_3.jpg)\n\n**CURRENT NOUNISH FEEDS**\n\n- **Agora Discord**\n  Auction and DAO Proposal events in #gov-updates channel\n- **A Nouns Community Discord**\n  Auction and Proposal events in #general channel\n  Nouns Nymz posts in #nouns-nymz\n- **Nouncil**\n  Auctions, Proposals, Token Transfers in Feeds Section\n  Proposal votes and status changes posted in appropriate Prop threads in #nouncil-votes\n\n  \n\n**THE FUTURE**\n\nWe will add all Nerman.js events as we create them, allowing easy Discord notifications from Prop House, Federation, other Nounish DAO's, and anywhere else we can get event feeds from. We will also experiment with different feed ideas using the events we have, for instance creating a feed that only displays Nouns DAO votes with 0 vote weight as an informal on-chain chat.\n\nWe will also develop a way for automated Nouns DAO prop discussions using forums, where a new thread is automatically created for each proposal.\n\n---\n\n## TERMS\n\n---\n\n- funding for the team to continue developing Nerman up to Dec 31, 2023. \n- all code will be open source and released under a permissive license (such as MIT).\n\n---\n\n## TRANSACTION\n\n---\n\n**Total Budget: 93 Ξ**\nJoel Cares (part time) and a team of 2 devs (full time)\n\n**Transaction**\n93 ETH streamed to 0x09b68020Fb9691C2c20687631EDCF16fdFCba277","proposer":"0x281eC184E704CE57570614C33B3477Ec7Ff07243","startBlock":17614762,"endBlock":17650762,"executed":false},"votes":[{"support":0,"voter":"0xC9A43964B791e5aBd13B98fAc710132AbFCa873E","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":"182k to continue the development of a discord bot is too much"},{"support":1,"voter":"0x59A55a61B6590f6a84A02BA93F256DBa6a994da4","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":"Bots are an incredible distribution channel for Nouns activity, and Joel has been building and maintaining almost all of them.

We almost entirely automated governance in Nouncil and completed a variety of out-of-scope features to make sure Nouncil's governance ran smoothly. Now, Nouncil is the most active voting member of Nouns DAO, with Nerman automating the 10,000+ votes of over 100 Nouncillors voting on more than 200 Nouns DAO props. We navigated the changing world of Nouns Discords as the official one closed, always building for an expanding decentralized social group. Whenever a good idea arose we implemented further features, like the Nouns Nymz feed. We continued working on the bots, at our own expense, long after the initial proposals end date.\n\nAt the end of the process the feature list felt limiting, preventing us from continuously learning and refining our direction according to user interest and DAO priority. For instance, when we wrote this proposal Nouns had an official Discord. Things change fast here.\n\nI also had several people note (semi-joking, semi-serious) that prop 77 was too long of a read. So - this proposal is shorter and focused on a broader vision over a specific time period. This gives us a clear roadmap, as well as the flexibility to learn, grow, and pivot as we work. \n\nThe primary focus of this prop is actually the Nounish developer SDK, not a discord bot. `npm install nerman`. The first version of the Nerman.js SDK was essential to all the bots we built and one of the most impactful things delivered.\n\nThis proposal is not an extensive documentation of the features we will add. This is a proposal to keep the team focused on the project, working as hard as we can towards the vision specified for 6 months. We are currently a team of three, with me working part time leading, planning, and coding. This proposal does not cover any of my time spent on other Nouns projects - Yitong, you can still expect an ambitious Nouns Short Shorts proposal.\n\nSome of the items here will be very significant to do extensively and correctly. We're not just checking boxes, this library should be the cleanest, most intuitive way of interacting with the Nouniverse. There is easily enough work here for the team to stay busy for 6 months. Each of the features listed is a potential rabbit hole. Properly indexing all Nouns DAO data and coding interesting queries to analyze it, implementing thoughtful connections to all Nouns related projects, implementing all Nounish DAO contracts... these are huge undertakings. On top of that, we intend on responding to an ever changing environment and incorporating new tools and features that pop up as we go. If something is getting traction within Nouns we will try to incorporate it quickly. If the DAO changes significantly, or forks, we will provide connections to all the feeds that need them.\n\nNerman.js will be the simplest way for developers to integrate Nouns events and data into their projects. For devs who want to use their own tooling, Nerman.js documentation will be the simplest place to learn about Nouns DAO contracts and the technical universe of projects surrounding Nouns."},{"support":0,"voter":"0xD25973a3Df7d2341DDEa48303a3E6AdDEc6184Bf","numberOfVotes":21,"reason":"using this space to recognize the irony that nerman will announce in discord that I don't want to pay them this well"},{"support":1,"voter":"0x08cEb8Bba685ee708C9c4c65576837cbE19B9dea","numberOfVotes":0,"reason":"I recognize the cost concerns here expressed by some of the \"Against\" voters, but I think when you factor in things like team quality and ETH volatility and so forth, this ask is okay with me personally.

Some interesting use cases for TWAMMs include [treasury diversification](https://twitter.com/HelloShreyas/status/1502177286170185735)*,* [whale liquidations](https://twitter.com/solendprotocol/status/1538553654575214592)*,* [peg maintenance](https://www.notion.so/fd88cb37208d4b0f9abaca4e276f9ddd?pvs=21)*, etc*.\n\nWe have been researching and developing TWAMMs since November 2021 and recently launched our protocol: [CronFi TWAMM](https://twitter.com/cronfinance/status/1645802789006876672). The code has been audited by SpearbitDAO, open-sourced, and verified on Etherscan. Considerable detail about the protocol is presented on the [docs page](https://docs.cronfi.com/twamm/).\n\n## **Product Design & Incentives**\n\n- AMM: we built our TWAMM as a custom pool on top of Balancer V2 Vault leveraging the *security, liquidity, flexibility, and gas advantages* of Balancer. Additionally, Balancer has become a Schelling point for protocols that want to leverage their AMM, thus creating network effects & composability advantages.\n- Traders: as a long-term trader (Nouns DAO), you only have to pay gas for starting, canceling, or withdrawing proceeds from your order. All the other sub-orders of the DCA are done virtually and cost the Nouns DAO no gas fees. Virtual orders are only written on-chain when the next user interacts with the protocol (generally an arbitrageur).\n- Arbitrageurs: as seen on other AMMs like Uniswap, arbitrageurs are important to keep the price of the assets in line with external venues. Arbitrageurs are critical for TWAMMs because trade sizes are significantly larger and last for multiple blocks. Therefore we have built and partnered with dedicated arbitrageurs (BloXRoute) to ensure pools are arbitraged frequently to ensure Nouns DAO gets the best swap return.\n- Liquidity: there will be a minimum of $30k liquidity in the pools and we expect that to reach between $50-100k in liquidity before the trade executes. TWAMMs are extremely capital efficient given that the trades are split across multiple blocks and arbitrageurs are consistently bringing new liquidity back to the system to correct price deviations — simulation details below illustrate these efficiencies and swap performance.\n\n## **Advantages**\n\n- Low fees: wstETH/rETH is a stable pair and long-term swappers pay a one-time **0.03% fee.**\n- Fully on-chain: zero dependencies on off-chain services, oracles, compute etc.\n- Flexible: issue, withdraw, and cancel orders with ease.\n    - Example new order: `sell 7_500 stETH for rETH in 100_000 blocks` ~roughly 2 weeks\n    - Helpful periphery contract to issue orders\n- Full control of orders and assets: non-custodial, cancellable, and withdraw proceeds at any time.\n- Withdraw multiple times: users can withdraw once at the end, or every set number of blocks – they just pay gas fees.\n- DCA over 1000’s of blocks gas-free: Nouns DAO would only pay gas for starting and ending suborders; arbitrageurs pay for placing suborders on-chain.\n- Analytics: we will have an analytics dashboard that shows how the order is being filled so the DAO can monitor the trade. There will also be a post-trade analysis and report.\n- Monitoring: we will be actively monitoring the trade as the `delegate` to ensure the order is being filled at a reasonable price. In case the trade escapes a reasonable threshold, we will cancel the trade on behalf of the DAO, refunding proceeds and the remaining unsold portion of the order to the Nouns DAO wallet.\n\n## **Risks**\n\n- Smart contract:\n    - Fully audited: see SpearbitDAO report [here](https://github.com/spearbit/portfolio/blob/master/pdfs/CronFinance-Spearbit-Security-Review.pdf).\n    - Hack Risks: built on Balancer V2 Vaults which have been battle-tested for 2+ years.\n    - Bricked Pools: we’ve done extensive research and mitigations for gas, order DDoS, numerical underflows, incorrect TWAMM parameters etc – more info here: [0slippage](https://mirror.xyz/0slippage.eth).\n    - Loss of Funds: open-source code, audited, verified, non-custodial, users in full control of funds, trade happens over multiple blocks so it can be canceled at any time by the user.\n    - Malicious Pool Admin: all pool administrators can do is pause the pool or change fees at which point Nouns DAO can cancel and withdraw their funds.\n- Lack of Arbitrage: we have built a flash swap arbitrage bot and also teamed up with BloXroute to provide a dedicated arbitrage service.\n- Poor Execution: orders are cancellable at any time i.e if the price escapes preferred bounds restart the order at another time. Also, DCA is generally a better strategy than spot purchase for large orders.\n- Information Leakage: this is not a big concern for a stable pair like wstETH/rETH which are like assets and have deep liquidity pools.\n- MEV/Sandwich Attacks: orders are broken into small pieces and thus the benefit of front/back running orders is minimal – see the Paradigm paper for further details.\n\n## **Competition**\n\nHere are the alternatives and how they stack up against TWAMM. Note this isn’t a comprehensive list, but a short summary.\n\n- Gnosis Auction:\n    - Pros: well-tested technology\n    - Cons: reliant on well-funded keepers, minimum buy lots, price upside capped, infrastructure overhead, limited timeframe, poor execution vs DCA over long periods.\n- Manual DCA:\n    - Pros: can execute it today\n    - Cons: need to write a smart contract or fat finger mistakes, fees for each sub-order, gas costs of sub-orders, limited # of sub-orders\n- DEX:\n    - Pros: complete trade in a single block\n    - Cons: poor liquidity, slippage, MEV attack vectors\n- Aggregators\n    - Pros: access to liquidity, completes trade quickly\n    - Cons: not on-chain, MEV attack vectors, slippage\n- OTC:\n    - Pros: limit orders and other novel trade execution algorithms\n    - Cons: off-chain, opaque, high fees, custodial, KYC, regulations, etc\n\n## Trade Simulations\n\nHere are the simulation results for the trade and expected returns. The initial trade is to show Nouns DAO the power of the protocol and ensure everything works as expected. This simulation is an approximation and results might vary based on liquidity, prices, volatility, etc. We will be monitoring the trade to ensure the trade fills won’t deviate drastically from the expected outcome. \n\n*NOTE*: this is a full contract simulation between a Balancer pool and our contract, using a fixed wstETH:rETH price in the balancer pool, fixed gas units, and fixed USD exchange rates. The simulation is executed with the actual contracts, with certain parameters held constant to evaluate the effect of liquidity and arbitrage frequency on swap performance.\n\n### $1M trade with $100k liquidity: 1.327% slippage\n\n![$1M Trade](https://file.notion.so/f/s/cc37a59f-9774-4859-a61c-69f8ee99fc0f/Untitled.png?id=af6d81b7-0b73-459b-bb0d-c6cafd2546d8&table=block&spaceId=7e9c2097-8472-4264-8933-88a90befa953&expirationTimestamp=1688119200000&signature=-LrcBvyt3f3UR6P-R3vrIOmejvImtapnsevhYmY6-yM&downloadName=Untitled.png)\n\nLPs make **1.537% ($1537)** from fees in a week, if you’re interested in adding liquidity to the pool to earn fees, you can add liquidity here: [wstETH <> rETH TWAMM Pool](https://www.app.cronfi.com/pools/0x6910C4e32D425a834Fb61e983C8083a84b0EBd01).

Swapping to rETH makes sense, but what happens when there are other liquid staking protocols proposed? What about Eigenlayer?\n\nThe biggest danger for a DAO is to focus more on treasury management than using the treasury. It's a trap that many DAOs fall into, and I hope that Nouns does not go down the same path.\n\nNoun 40's reasoning about diversification is thoughtful and being willing to support new protocols benefits the ecosystem. I agree with its reasoning in isolation - taken in the context of this proposal, it's spot on. My worry is around sending a signal that Nouns is open to further treasury management proposals, especially following so quickly after 313. For that reason, I abstain.\n\n*sent from voter.wtf*"},{"support":2,"voter":"0xA86882277E69FbF0a51805cdc8b0a3a113079E63","numberOfVotes":2,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x29c5dad7E34d0A27d6F65a0A7E07E4d03Dcd68c8","numberOfVotes":2,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0xE7304bA0f157f2Ade94015934284b6704BC72911","numberOfVotes":2,"reason":"It makes sense for the ecosystem, we need more staking diversity."},{"support":2,"voter":"0x86030dbbCe1c771Ff6622C20455cd3619aa93c05","numberOfVotes":55,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0xf6B6F07862A02C85628B3A9688beae07fEA9C863","numberOfVotes":46,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x44905fC26d081A23b0758f17b5CED1821147670b","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x6b2645b468A828a12fEA8C7D644445eB808Ec2B1","numberOfVotes":41,"reason":"Sent from https://goops.com Nouns Governance Pool"},{"support":0,"voter":"0x8ac3ecf6973E020cC0E6e8989Fb71B4a77D65987","numberOfVotes":2,"reason":""}]},{"prop":{"id":321,"description":"# Mogu - a nounish explorer\n\n***TL;DR - Fund 3 months of full-time development of a Nounish explorer for 15 ETH.***\n\n## [MOGU](http://mmmogu.com) SO FAR\nNouns participants require custom tools for their use cases; we’ve seen this with Agora, voter.wtf, and other front-ends. The user questions that Mogu tackles are: “*Who is 0x34ab..ef2? What do they do in the world of Nouns?*”, or broadly “*What’s happening in Nouns right now?*”. As time goes on, there will be more and more participants and complexity to Nouns, for the only option currently to answer these questions is some messy mix of Etherscan, Agora, Google, and various governance clients. **Mogu combines all these into one interface for power users.**\n\nMogu currently parses every Nouns vote, delegation, bid, transfer, settlement, and proposal in a human readable and accessible way. As soon as any of these events happen, Mogu creates custom [transaction pages](https://www.mmmogu.com/tx/0xa26822afab95bb53d185b0daab703b64fae597cf818ef63428cdeb8068d1b2ac) and [address pages](https://mmmogu.com/address/nounders.eth). I’ve also built other features like a delegation table and a vote-planning board.\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/r1lv66Esu3.png)\n\n\nUsage is somewhat comparable to voter.wtf so far - 700 visitors and 2,000 page views in the last month. More importantly, it’s steadily growing. Below is an average of views over the last 7 days.\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/B1mMCViu2.png)\n\n\nPeople are liking it but there’s still room to add features and improve -\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/ryYRTEo_2.png)\n\n\n## NEXT 3 MONTHS\nI’m asking for 15 ETH to go full-time on Mogu for 3 months. The goal by the end is for Mogu to be power users’ go-to tool, and for it to be the default linked block explorer across the Nouns ecosystem.\n\nI’m going to build at least the following features:\n* Aggregated information: delegation history, address’ voting stats, etc..\n* A variety of views: proposal pages, nouns pages, feeds, and filters\n* Parsing non-Nouns transactions so that Mogu has the whole chain’s context available, not just Nouns things.\n* A comprehensive search (for transaction content, props, nouns, etc..)\n* Other experimental features: potentially bookmarking transactions, transaction notes, user statuses\n\n## ABOUT ME\nI’m [mrtn](http://twitter.com/anquetil). I’ve been in Nouns for over a year, and have worked on teams such as Builder, Agora, and most recently started and ran Explorer Grants and Hack Week!

I think this is a fun, sort of grassroots, small-is-big proliferation effort from a team that is highly committed to Nouns and has done quality work in the past.*\n \n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rkFD93zdn.jpg)\n### TL;DR\n- We propose to launch a stamp-collecting campaign to nounify Korea.\n- Our primary objective is to establish Nouns as a prominent pop culture brand.\n- By collaborating with coffee shops and utilizing Nouns' CC0 content, we can maximize Nouns' exposure and provide incentives for fans.\n- To achieve this, we kindly request $65,000 or around $4,600 per location to promote nouns at 10+ coffee shops, 2 retail stores, and 2 art galleries over the next three months.\n\n### Description\nWe have observed the success of Nouns' flywheel in Brazil, China, Japan, and other communities. We propose to launch activation campaign in Korea in collaboration with ten authentic coffee shops. This campaign aims to educate people about nouns and engage them in the process. Participants will collect noggle-stamps and have the chance to earn stylish nounish t-shirts as rewards.\n\nOur team firmly believes in our energy and talent to establish Nouns as a prominent pop culture brand in Korea. The campaign will span three months, during which people will receive noggle-stamps with their coffee purchases. Once they collect 10 stamps, they can exchange a coupon card for a nounish t-shirt.\n\nTo ensure widespread exposure, all coffee shops will display posters, t-shirts, and magazines featuring on-chain proposals. Furthermore, these t-shirts will be available for purchase at retail stores and art galleries. We are committed to creating high-quality t-shirts using nounish cc0 content, with additional approval from the artists involved.\n\nFor the successful activation of the nouns community in Korea and the promotion of Nouns in 10+ locations over three months, we kindly request $65,000 in funding.\n\n### The stamp collection campaign\n![](https://i.imgur.com/51HGjJe.jpg)\n\nThe campaign will focus on creating visibility, engaging local community, and establishing a loyal fan base. The coffee shops will become a place for people to gather and learn about nouns through arts on t-shirts and information in magazines.\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/B1e0gbXuh.png)\n\nCoupon cards featuring nouns will be distributed at the coffee shops' counters. We anticipate each coffee shop to distribute around 50-30 coupon cards daily, totaling approximately 27,000 cards throughout the campaign. In our focused campaign, we will give out special coupon cards that need only 2 stamps to people who are interested in blockchain and NFTs through our network of friends.\n\n### T-shirts\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/ByDeX5Md3.jpg)\n\nT-shirts will be placed in highly visible areas at coffee shops. We'll use Nouns' cc0 content to create a beautiful collection of t-shirts. Our goal is to pleasantly surprise everyone with the quality and spirit of nounish artworks. These t-shirts will be made from scratch specifically for this campaign from high-quality materials and tailored in various styles for both men and women. Each label and tag will feature Noggles and links to Noun's homepage and Twitter account.\n\nWe will strategically strive to get the t-shirts in the hands of pop stars, actors, musicians, and models.\n\nThe t-shirts will be the same as those for prop173, 'Sail in NY,' that received praise from the community for their quality.\n\n### NOUNS.WTF magazine\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rkFD93zdn.jpg)\n\nWe propose creating a NOUNS.WTF magazine as a powerful marketing and storytelling tool to convey the campaign's message. The magazine will be cost-effective to design using Canva templates and nounish CC0 content. The magazines will be distributed at partner coffee shops and serve as a guide to NounsDAO.\n\nThe magazine will feature articles about: \n- campaign\n- t-shirt collection\n- top on-chain proposals\n- nounish subdaos\n- overview of government clients.\n- We invite individuals and subdaos to contribute to the magazine's creation. Contact us on Twitter to publish an article or a post ([Nouns Seoul](https://twitter.com/nounsseoul)).\n\n### Coffee shops and other partner properties\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/H1Zj0T5u3.jpg)\n\nWe are going to collaborate with authentic coffee shops around Seoul. Here are the links to coffee shops located in popular areas such as [Jeongno](https://www.instagram.com/cha.teul/), [Itaewon](https://www.instagram.com/theroyalfad/), and [Sinsa](https://www.instagram.com/minoscoffeecult/). Additionally, we are going to sell t-shirts at popular [Fashion and lifestyle](https://www.instagram.com/niceweather.seoul/) goods stores and [art galleries](https://www.instagram.com/print_bakery/).\n\nAs of now, we onboarded three coffee shops, one retail store, and one art gallery. We can rest of the partner properties recruited in no time.\n\n### Why Korea\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SJUNQsvw2.jpg)\n\nKorea is known for its collection of cool nounish items, ranging from sailboats, resin toys, and children's books to motorcycles. In line with this, our goal is to unite and provide a firsthand experience to an increasing number of Nouns' fans. We believe that the timing is ideal to launch a nounish campaign, aiming to showcase the beautiful aspects of Nouns' art, culture, and governance. This initiative will not only attract a larger base of devoted fans but also facilitate the discovery of new nounish memes and contribute to the advancement of nounish culture.\n\n### Timeline\nThe campaign is scheduled to commence in July and continue until October. The team estimates that it will require approximately 3-4 weeks to complete all the necessary preparations.\n1 week - legal matters\n1 week - coffee shop recruitment\n1 week - decorations/logistics\n3 weeks - manufacture 2,000 t-shirts\n3 weeks - design and print NOUNS.WTF magazine\n\n### The team\n1. **[Fiveoceans_dev](https://twitter.com/fiveoceans_dev)** t-shirts manufacturing and distribution\n2. **[Morph](https://www.instagram.com/morphmgmt/)** - legal matters and work with coffee shops.\n3. **[Jhee](https://twitter.com/jheeart_nft)** NOUNS.WTF magazine\n4. **[Duckhead](https://twitter.com/_duckhead)** coffee shops decorations\n\n### Budget\n$35,000 - manufacture 2,000 t-shirts (custom tags with noggles, different styles, artwork press, packaging)\n$10,000 - coffee shops' rental fees (10 coffee shops, 3 months, $330 per month)\n$4,000 - NOUNS.WTF magazine design and printing\n$2,500 - logistics & storage (Ex. 100 t-shirts weight 22 kg or 48 pounds)\n$2,500 - legal, tax, signing contracts with coffee shops, outsourcing  company's fees to conduct business etc\n$3,000 - decorations $300 per coffee shop (10 t-shirt stands, 100 posters, 10 noggle stamps, 27,000 coupon cards, and others)\n$2,000 - photo & video production to document progress and share on SNS\n$6,000 - team's compensation.

But now it is leading a global movement that it has pioneered. They accept crypto as a form of payment in their e-commerce, have tokenized experiences, have a metaverse, and see this new market as a point of differentiation.

We are seeking funding to expand our actions in 3 complementary strategic directions:\n\n1. New regions 📍\n2. Proper marketing in Brazil 🇧🇷\n3. New product categories 👀   \n\n**1) New regions 📍**    \n![](https://i.imgur.com/4iKllzi.png)\nNarcose is already part of a network of regular collaborative breweries, through which it markets its beers in the US and Europe. We will take Public Good Beer to these markets, also integrating them into our onboarding ecosystem and turning them into real Nouns builders.\n\nWe are asking for 4500 USDC amount, enough for label printing, marketing material, initial sample distribution (est. 500 cans of beer), and post-production FOR EACH of our partners:\n\nStillwater Brewery (Seattle) 🇺🇸\nAgainst the Grain (Kentucky) 🇺🇸\nWooden Ship (Minneapolis) 🇺🇸\nBrewski (Sweden) 🇸🇪\nBierol (Austria) 🇦🇹\nCanil (Portugal) 🇵🇹\n\nNote that the goal is to catalyst a collaborative beer that will be sold as part of the brewery’s portfolio, not to distribute it only at a single event. The funding is an incentive to kickstart production and marketing and involves a commitment from the brewery.\n\n**BUDGET: 6x 4500 = 27000 USDC**   \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/jvG8dTb.png)\n**2) Proper marketing in Brazil 🇧🇷**\n\nInternational expansion will not be instantaneous, as it demands a free schedule in the industry. In this period, we take advantage of the existing inventory of over 3000 cans produced.\n\nDespite the success of Phase 1, we believe we haven’t reached full IRL proliferation potential for such a pioneer project. We had 0.5 ETH for everything (sub 300 cans, and very short-scale marketing activation). Thus, the proposed expansion would bring the deserved impact and tons of resources for further promotion of the Nouniverse.\n\nThe next 2 biggest crypto weeks in Brazil happen in August (during NFTRio) and September (Blockchain Rio, which connected the Brazilian Nouns community IRL for the first time). We are asking 4500 USDC for each week to make a big impact at main and side events, including:\n\n* Public Good Beer distribution\n* Marketing materials (shirts, stickers, temporary tattoos)\n* Activations (POAP distribution, treasure hunts, giveaways)\n* Professional quality media production\n* We are asking for 4500 USDC for each week.\n\n**BUDGET: 2x 4500 = 9000 USDC**   \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/DbzkhNr.gif)\n**3) New product categories 👀**\n\nBeyond beer, we have the opportunity to extend the portfolio to two synergic brands/categories:\n\na) BBQ sauces - for the weekly beer-fueled barbecues we do all around Brazil; and\nb) Sunscreen - for our 7637 km of coastline, full of bikinis, surf stars and sunglasses ⌐◨-◨\n\nWe would like to allocate a total budget of 5000 USDC to work this as the project progresses. Alongside with this we also have the coordination and maintenance of the activities during period of 6 months at a cost of 6000 USDC.\n![](https://i.imgur.com/p6Hr6hb.png)\n\n**BUDGET: 11000 USDC**   \n\n**TEAM**\n\nfabioseva.eth\njp.⌐◨-◨\n\nWe are very excited to keep spreading the CC0 culture and bringing companies on board with us. A huge shoutout and heartfelt thanks to everyone who’s supporting the project either online and IRL. Don’t forget to follow [@PublicGoodBeer](https://twitter.com/publicgoodbeer) on Twitter for all the latest updates.

It's incredibly satisfying to witness a tangible representation of the Public Goods brand. With its CC0 recipe, distinctive branding, and collaboration with various breweries, this project stands out as an innovative venture that extends the reach of the meme. It also encourages people to contemplate the importance of both CC0 and Public Goods.","proposer":"0x3B60e31CFC48a9074CD5bEbb26C9EAa77650a43F","startBlock":17630168,"endBlock":17666168,"executed":false},"votes":[{"support":0,"voter":"0x7dE92ca2D0768cDbA376Aac853234D4EEd8d8B5C","numberOfVotes":21,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x3B60e31CFC48a9074CD5bEbb26C9EAa77650a43F","numberOfVotes":2,"reason":"Public Good Beer for onchain summer. \n🍺☀️\n\n*sent from voter.wtf*"},{"support":0,"voter":"0xD25973a3Df7d2341DDEa48303a3E6AdDEc6184Bf","numberOfVotes":21,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0xba2b9804FbffA8F1A8F7DC8dd600E21268beF09F","numberOfVotes":3,"reason":"Reasonable ask to continue a project that explores a unique value prop"},{"support":1,"voter":"0xFC218F1164cfEf8e4EC7c2aca8fB019DC8976214","numberOfVotes":20,"reason":"(noun40 voting via agora proxy)\n\nthis is a unique direction to proliferating the nouns brand that I'd love to continue to support and see how far it can go."},{"support":1,"voter":"0xaE65E700f3f8904ac1007d47a5309dD26f8146c0","numberOfVotes":2,"reason":""},{"support":0,"voter":"0xC9A43964B791e5aBd13B98fAc710132AbFCa873E","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0xA86882277E69FbF0a51805cdc8b0a3a113079E63","numberOfVotes":2,"reason":""},{"support":0,"voter":"0x1e66a3D0a6A327b1F29e8ACf3a3d9E1E4E088683","numberOfVotes":2,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0xb8a9Ed8D008FA1F161809f15a11F4161FB8b717e","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":0,"voter":"0x4Bd8649394704817434feFE35042f1F1685bCA4A","numberOfVotes":19,"reason":""},{"support":0,"voter":"0xfc42111bDfF4FCbF5F531286B09875962f389F3D","numberOfVotes":3,"reason":""},{"support":0,"voter":"0x520F977ff2fb5fc3a188B9B7821d583BC8741BC7","numberOfVotes":16,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x83fCFe8Ba2FEce9578F0BbaFeD4Ebf5E915045B9","numberOfVotes":18,"reason":"personally very interested in understanding how companies with existing distribution networks can leverage nouns / help nouns. experiments in 'open source' in the CPG domain are probably also very rare and worth embracing when they happen"},{"support":1,"voter":"0x7B7736a2C07C4332FfaD45a039d2117aE15e3f66","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x4575e437306d10Ca7433E22796ffF7dca70E6699","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x1db19B9903c5510AA5a866ea643Eb021CD12Bda0","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":"\n\n*sent from voter.wtf*"},{"support":1,"voter":"0x36A5Bc205DF1ED65C86301022cfc343a6ce546ff","numberOfVotes":2,"reason":""},{"support":0,"voter":"0x2767eDfee9f5ba743511Ee4187A596B302B43938","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":"I commend \"Public Good\" for its achievements thus far, but I don't believe this is the best use of funds for taking the next step.\n\nIt appears to be more of paid enthusiasm rather than strategic allocation.

This collaboration would provide proliferation into a new market and a connection between two of the fastest growing web3 brands, including content proliferation during launch.\n\n**About Pudgy Penguins**\n\n***Toy launch*** – Pudgy Penguins recently launched our Shark Collectible on NTWRK and sold out 150 pieces in under 3 seconds at $249 a piece. It was one of NTWRKS fastest sales on record. NTWRK features some of the most passionate physical collectors in the world and we believe exposing the Nouns brand on their platform will be a huge step forward. **On Ebay, Pudgy Sharks have resold for $750 - $1,250 a piece**.\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BkZgwLPdn.png)\n\nView Pudgy Penguins CEO Luca Netz's unboxing of \"Shark Suit\" collectible here: https://twitter.com/pudgypenguins/status/1671987835518480386?s=20\n\nThe team also recently attended the Licensing Show highlighting all the different toy lines we are producing. See a recap video here: https://twitter.com/LucaNetz/status/1672343978958569474?s=20\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HJwfqVY_n.png)\n\n\nThe Nouns version of this collectible would have a similar digital connection via the rfid chip with provenance demonstrated on the blockchain in the ethos of NounsDAO. It would come with its own custom box, integrated story, and collectible card, optimizing for the best collector experience possible.\n\n---\n\n**Why Nouns?**\n\nNouns has been the staple for decentralized brand building and we see it as the only real Web3 brand outside of Pudgy Penguins. We want to align the two best Web3 brands and IP to create a historic moment for the traditional world.\n\nDue to the cc0 nature of NounsDAO IP, Pudgy Penguins could move forward without the DAO's approval but we want this to be an official collaboration, bringing the Huddle into the Nouns ecosystem.\n\n\n**The Benefit to NounsDAO**\n\nThe extensive proliferation we had with our recent toy launch will be repeated with this launch, including extensive social media coverage, press coverage, marketing efforts from NTWRK and Pudgy Penguins through traditional channels (posters, magazines, email blasts, product seedings, etc) will bring millions of impressions to the Nouns brand.\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BkXXTVFd3.png)\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/Hk84TEF_h.png)\n\n**⌐◨-◨ x Pudgy Penguins Launch Plan**\n\nWe are proposing to create 499 Red Penguins and 499 Blue Penguins with the matching Nouns glasses. We would retail it for $299 and we would have a 10 total Penguins within the lot that would feature a pair of Gold glasses. The gold glasses figures will be treated as a golden ticket and will be randomly given to 10 lucky purchasers. We want to add gold plating to these gold glasses to make the value proposition even more special. \n\nWe expect this collectible to be ready for launch four months after passage of this proposal, in time for the holidays. Expected launch date is 12/08/2023. \n\n---\n**Joining NounsDAO**\n\nIn addition to the extensive proliferation that will result from this collaboration, we want the Huddle will join NounsDAO! A percentage of profit from the sale of this ⌐◨-◨ x Pudgy Penguins toy line will be put towards buying a Noun on auction. We'll be requesting an igloo and will utilize the new NounScout.wtf site when ready to put in the request.\n\n**Team**\n\nThe Pudgy Penguins team is a team of elite brand builders and marketers. Our intent with this collaboration is to create as much exposure as possible. If you’re familiar with our brand and our success thus far you know we can do this just as good if not better than anybody else.\n\nFor more information, visit: https://pudgypenguins.com/about-us\n\n---\nWe are asking for 10 ETH to go to wallet: 0x3f8cD3cc58391E704A2A0fab2482B8116Cb9D670\n\nFunds would be used to add the 10 gold Penguins to the lot to add this special touch and gamification, which otherwise would be a huge loss leader if not covered. However, we believe it’s a necessary feature to deliver a second to none experience unlike anything previously done in the traditional collectible world. \n\nFor more about Pudgy Penguins, visit: https://pudgypenguins.com\n\nAND thank you to 87B0nes and Shan for the delegation and feedback; and thank you to Prof Werder for assisting with the proposal process and help writing the prop.","proposer":"0x3f8cD3cc58391E704A2A0fab2482B8116Cb9D670","startBlock":17665275,"endBlock":17701275,"executed":true},"votes":[{"support":1,"voter":"0x08cEb8Bba685ee708C9c4c65576837cbE19B9dea","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":"My two gwei: I'm a yes.

From the organizations we work with to the communities we impact, every tale stands as testament to the transformative power of Nouns.\n    - Mucho Love isn't just a platform for good deeds; we're spearheading a movement. \n    - We're not just telling stories, we're changing lives, one narrative at a time.\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/S1Bq7MMun.jpg)\n\n\n### **OUR NEXT BIG STEPS** \nWe're set to boost our impact and carry Nouns & Mucho Love further with three significant strides:\n- **COLLABORATIONS**: To broaden Mucho Love's reach and enhance our influence, we are strategically partnering with some of the largest institutions and organizations in the world. \n    - By joining forces, we can collectively reach a larger audience, build stronger relationships, and make a profound difference to the communities we serve. \n- **FULL-TIME MEDIA TEAM**: Recognizing the value of commitment and passion, we’ve established a dedicated, full-time media team.\n    - We've made the strategic choice to prioritize full-time, dedicated individuals over part-time talent, no matter how skilled.\n- **EMPOWERING CONTRIBUTORS**: A key focus for us is the empowerment of our volunteers and members, providing them with the autonomy to take charge of their own activations. \n    - This empowerment strengthens ownership, responsibility, and engagement, fueling passion for our mission while cultivating a culture of innovation and problem-solving. \n\n### **WORLD-CLASS COLLABORATORS** \nThrough our past work, **the ⌐◨-◨'s have become a symbol of doing good**. This has helped us connect with world-class partners.\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HkI6OwQD3.png)\n\nIf you don't know what **TECHO** does, **MrBeast** recently partnered with them in one of his latest philanthropy videos. You can check out the impactful collaboration [**HERE**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08wlrlPjWeE).\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rkma02zr3.png)\n### **WHAT STORIES WILL WE TELL?** \n- **TECHO - Building New Beginnings**: A dawn bus ride to needy communities, partnering with TECHO to build homes for impoverished families. \n    - Constructing rainwater harvesting systems and vital plumbing infrastructure, each hammer stroke echoes our commitment to a better future.\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BJfoIILOn.jpg)\n- **6000 BURGER DONATION** **- Feeding Hope**: Inspired by MrBeast’s record, we will cook and distribute 6,000 burgers for food-insecure communities. \n    - In partnership with [KNIFE](https://www.instagram.com/kniferd/), we transform an ordinary day into a memorable one.\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BkInLJIdh.jpg)\n- **SAVE THE CHILDREN - Ignite Imagination, Spark Change**: We're heading to underprivileged neighborhoods with Nounish designs and coloring books, we will facilitate education, arts, and sports workshops.   \n- **JOMPEAME - Little Warriors, Big Victories**: We will visit children courageously fighting neurological disorders, delivering crucial supplies to aid their battle.\n    - Witnessing their resilience, we're determined to help them overcome daily challenges.\n- **Canvas of Nouns: Unleashing Creativity in a Thousand Colors**: In partnership with [STAINED](https://www.instagram.com/stainedconcept/), we're donating 1000 white t-shirts to an orphanage, turning each one into a canvas for creativity. \n    - The children will use provided art supplies to paint their own designs on the t-shirts, celebrating the inner artist in each of them. \n    - The painting process will take place on a giant white textile, creating a live noggle canvas of 400-600 children expressing their creativity together. \n- **NOUNISH CHRISTMAS - Spreading Holiday Nounish-Cheer**: Organizing a Christmas dinner for underprivileged communities, we decorate a Christmas tree with a Nounish Star and themed ornaments.\n    -  Gifts, possibly including new NOUNISH FRIENDS toys, will add joy to the festive celebration.\n#### **MEMBER LED ACTIVATIONS (2-3)**\nHere's the list of ideas being considered by Mucho Love members: \n- **Homeless Care-Package Distribution**\n- **Beach Clean-Ups**\n- **Nouns-Powered Library**\n- **Nutrition, Mental Health, and Hygiene Workshops**\n- **Art Workshops**\n- **Tree Planting Campaign**\n- **Blood Donation Campaign**\n- **Nouns-Powered Children Playground**\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SJX3ta_v2.jpg)\n\n### **WHAT'S THE FUTURE OF MUCHO LOVE?** \n- **Global Expansion**: Our mission is set to cross borders, with organizations in Costa Rica & Colombia already showing interest. We're looking at creating an international collaboration network.\n- **Business Partnerships**: Businesses are keen on content that promotes their brand positively. We're exploring mutual beneficial partnerships to generate large-scale impact.\n- **Event-based Fundraising**: We're considering launching annual events, like a Nouns Music Festival or a Nouns Fundraising Run. These events can support Mucho Love significantly while building community and Nouns brand awareness.\n- **Brand and Impact Events**: We plan to set up large events that will both promote the Nouns brand and generate revenue for Mucho Love's operations.\n- **Sustainability Forecast**: We aim for Mucho Love to be self-sustainable by mid-2024. We're looking at attracting more partnerships, sponsorships, and using Nouns-powered events for fundraising.\n\n### **IMPACT & GROWTH**\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rJ2EuCvw3.png)\n### **PROBLEMS FACED**\nOver the past 10 months, we've overcome many challenges and improved our methods.\n- **Outsourcing Content Team**: We outsourced our content team, which, despite its benefits, led to notable challenges, including a limited understanding of the Nouns and Mucho Love ethos, content inconsistency, and loss of the 'magic' due to rotating personnel and equipment changes. \n    - The solution? We're now building a dedicated, full-time team that is deeply invested in our mission and platform's growth.\n- **Pre-setting all Activities & Funds**: We felt tied to our initial plans, even when other exciting possibilities appeared. \n    - Our solution is to keep some of our fund flexible. This way, we can jump on fresh opportunities that align with our mission, making our operations more adaptable and responsive.\n\n### **CONTENT STRATEGY**\nOur activations serve as a content launchpad. We will create:\n- **Short Videos**: Bite-sized activation outcome and goal overviews.\n- **Impact Leaders Podcast Interviews**: In-depth dialogues with our activation leaders.\n- **Member’s Story Clips**: Member reflections on our activities.\n- **Photographic Documentation**: Capturing the essence of each activity.\n- **Long-Format Videos**: Documenting each activation’s journey, from planning to reflection.\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/Hy9yv0wP3.png)\n### **DISTRIBUTION** \nOur collaborations with major entities expand our content's reach.\n- Their networks become extensions of ours, broadening our impact stories. In return, they get to highlight their good deeds by sharing our content. \n    - We generate and share captivating content across Instagram, Twitter, and YouTube, attracting diverse audiences with our purpose and uplifting tales. \n- The good we do spurs further content creation, establishing a growth cycle. \n    - Each partnership amplifies our reach and demonstrates the positive power of Nouns.\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/r1g8Krw_2.png)\n\n### BUDGET \n\n### **MUCHO LOVE LED ACTIVATIONS** - 64,100 USDC\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/B1f55eQK3.png)\n\n\n### **COLLABORATIVE ACTIVATIONS** - 70,000 USDC\n- **TECHO** \t\n    - *House Building Campaign*\n        - Site Preparation, Building Materials, Permit & Legal Fees, Infrastructure, Furnishing, Transportation, House Amenities\t\n    - *Water Catchment System*\n        - Materials, Transportation, Replacement Filters, Cleaning Supplies, Maintenance Supplies, Water Treatment\t\n    - *Tubing Systems*\t\n        - Pipes and Fittings, Pumping System, Excavation and Installation, Water Source Development, Transportation, Maintenance Cost \n- **JOMPEAME**\n    - *Pedriatic Neurological Medical Aid*\n        - Medications, Image Testing, Lab Tests, Assistive Devices, Transportation, Physiotherapy Equipment, Specialized Medical Supplies, Dietary Supplements, Home Care Items\n- **SAVE THE CHILDREN**\t\n    - *Nounish Workshops*\n        - Clothing Supplies, Food Donations, School Supplies, Educational Workshops, Art Workshops, Sport Equipment for 1000-3000 children.\t\n\n### **Media Production & Content Creation - 25,000 USDC**\n- 25,000 USDC for content team + 12,000 USDC that were saved up from last proposal*\n    1.

I am not sure how I feel over the long run about a social impact platform being reliant on the DAO for funding, but there are many other such orgs in the Nouns ecosystem right now so I'm trying to keep an open mind! Best of luck!\n\nFrom the Discord conversation I gather that most, if not all, of the work promised in the last prop was done. Am glad to hear! Though I wish that could have been highlighted more clearly in the prop, and we could see artifacts of those stories, as a good amount of the budget went to film and photo crews. \n\nI think the learnings here are good, though I am a little leary of the impulse to scale and go bigger. Something that I have liked so far about the work is the \"small is big\" feeling. I love the barbershop story: allowing people to do something fun and interesting and self directed is more exciting than charity. I am excited about the member led activations outlined. \n\nOverall, my current understanding of Nouns DAO is that the DAO functions to help facilitate running the idea maze of \"What is the most compelling identity and direction for these CC0 assets?\" \"What is the most exciting story for Nouns?\" We do this by stampings things as \"Nounish\" by funding them and/or partnering in content releases. \n\nToday there are several varying and coherent answers to the question, \"What should Nouns fund?\": art, social impact, public goods, CC0, governance tools, the list goes on.\n\nSo, though I am not 100% certain the direction proposed in this prop is the best, I trust the team. I think they are good people who care a lot about Nouns, and who have done charismatic work to date.

If you’re new to CC0, it’s a \"no copyright reserved\" option in which all copyright is relinquished and dedicated to the public domain. This enables use of CC0 NFTs with zero legal repercussions, inspiring creative derivatives and remixes of original works. \n \nCC0 may be everywhere, but here’s a lesser-known fact: Creative Commons is also a whole nonprofit organization (see our most recent annual report [here](https://creativecommons.org/2023/04/11/state-of-the-commons-2022/)).  \n\nWe’ve been around since 2001 and are a small but mighty team of 22 open access enthusiasts. We not only manage the CC licenses and public domain tools, we run campaigns, programming, and training in Open Education, Culture, Climate, and Journalism; host a CC Global Summit in locations around the world; and tackle major policy issues impacting the Internet and global commons as part of a broad Movement for a Better Internet.  \n\nWe’re doing a lot, but it is all in service of the CC licenses, a thriving commons, and a healthy public domain, which can be expanded instantly by contemporary creators embracing the use of CC0, a globally interoperable public domain dedication tool. Like Nouns, we’re big promoters of remix culture, and have been watching (largely from the sidelines until now!) as NFT creators bring new energy and enthusiasm to the public domain.  \n\nWe’re excited to bring our two communities together to demonstrate the staying power of open access tools like CC0 even in a technological landscape that’s rapidly changing. Nouns is a prime example of this. You’re an open-source brand merging CC0 with blockchain. Nouns demonstrates the imaginative possibilities of combining public interest tools like CC Licenses with emergent technologies.\n\n## Request\nDespite being components of longstanding and emerging technologies, CC licenses are hard to fundraise for–most people are unaware that there’s no underlying revenue stream to maintain their legal and tech infrastructure and continue to advocate for their use. The licenses are not new tech anymore, despite constantly being used in fresh ways, and it’s challenging when most funders are more interested in flashy new projects than supporting the work those ventures build on. \n\nWe are dedicated to preserving and improving our licenses, so that they can continue to be the go-to tool for future technology and creative work. That’s why CC is seeking funding for our general operations and license infrastructure, which would allow us to sustain currently underfunded but foundational areas of work: advocating for the use and adoption of open content at all levels and in all arenas, stewarding and innovating the licensing infrastructure we provide, and training future generations of creators and open advocates. \n\nWith support from Nouns, Creative Commons can prioritize the stewardship of the tools that have unlocked access to an estimated 2 billion works over the past 20 years. We are hoping your community will support us, as our work has supported your creativity.  \n\n## Proposed Transactions\n\n[Endaoment](https://app.endaoment.org/orgs/04-3585301)\nAddress: 0x72f7ab7cd03113bd4bc332d0859e5664c79646ee\n\n","proposer":"0x83fCFe8Ba2FEce9578F0BbaFeD4Ebf5E915045B9","startBlock":17700265,"endBlock":17736265,"executed":false},"votes":[]},{"prop":{"id":330,"description":"# Bid on Alien Punk\n\n![noggle punk](https://i.imgur.com/Osw8GaD.png) ","proposer":"0xf3F321913635E282e20d292fA1Dc80728c3373f5","startBlock":17715487,"endBlock":17751487,"executed":false},"votes":[]},{"prop":{"id":331,"description":"# stETH Peg Protection Execution\n\nThis proposal will execute the underlying effort of the successfully passed proposal to obtain [stETH Peg Protection](https://nouns.wtf/vote/313). \n\nAs a reminder, this effort required two steps: \n\n- ************Part 1 (completed):************ Audit the helper contracts that enable the DAO to execute transactions on L2 and purchase protection using the already existing and audited Nouns [token-buyer](https://github.com/nounsDAO/token-buyer) contracts ([OptimismL1Proxy](https://github.com/portaldiscovery/optimism-cross-chain-proxy) and [CozyMultiOraclePriceFeed](https://github.com/portaldiscovery/cozy-v2-token-buyer))\n- ************Part 2 (current):************ Set the bid price for stETH peg protection on the CozyMultiOraclePriceFeed to 2% and transfer 12 ETH to the TokenBuyer dedicated to buying protection\n\nSince the passing of the part 1, the Nouns helper contracts that enable the DAO to swap tokens on L2 have been [audited](https://github.com/portaldiscovery/cozy-v2-token-buyer/blob/main/audits/veridise-report-july-3-2023.pdf) and deployed ([OptimismL1Proxy](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x4d6EC0e31c9177c696Fb49c2Ad04aB766e91F38f), [TokenBuyer](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0xdD9e5Dab49d8394660d4Fe2383692448e3944d2b), [Payer](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0xc2a9a0d746535cec8dd841651172396dea38464c), [CozyMultiOraclePriceFeed](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x31D2CfCFD44e0e1F5c36d065E665b56B6354EA5c)).

If you have other questions, join the [discussion telegram group](https://t.me/+rfuoI8SkzxdhYjRh) and ask.\n\n### Is there enough capacity on Cozy v2 for the DAO to get the proposed amount of protection?\n\nYes. At the time of writing there’s currently ~$1M of available stETH peg protection protection on Cozy v2. \n\n### How exactly does the “bid” work?\n\nUpon execution of this proposal:\n\n1. The tokenbuyer will be configured with a bid price of 2% (which translates to ~1.5% APR) for stETH peg protection tokens\n2. 12 ETH is transferred from the DAO treasury to the tokenbuyer\n3.

I disagree with wilson that this will lead to a slippery slope of talking more about treasury investments. I think we've always drew the line at the \"risk free rate\" eth investing—eth staking—and while there has been additional considerations of which staking pools and depeg insurance that popped up, I don't think the rabbit holes here are infinite. I also don't think getting to our eth position to 100% staked eth limits our spending in any way. We can distribute stETH or support auto selling it for USDC (like we do for ETH right now and is what most prop builders ask for anyways). I almost just want to get this conversation over with and be close to 100% staked eth, build the infra to support that seamlessly, and move on. Also the ~500 ETH additional yield we'll get from staking the 10k ETH is not nothing. It's being able to fund another ~$1M / year sized team. That's like being able to fund another nounish or agora sized team effort, which is meaningful! \n\nFor all these reasons... voting FOR!

Alignment has been.\nSo while I don't agree with voting FOR this prop for the reasons of defending against poison pill props, I'm voting for b/c I'd kind of like to get over with the \"how much should we stake?\" discussion. I disagree with wilson that this will lead to a slippery slope of talking more about treasury investments. I think we've always drew the line at the \"risk free rate\" eth investing—eth staking—and while there has been additional considerations of which staking pools and depeg insurance that popped up, I don't think the rabbit holes here are infinite. I also don't think getting to our eth position to 100% staked eth limits our spending in any way. We can distribute stETH or support auto selling it for USDC (like we do for ETH right now and is what most prop builders ask for anyways). I almost just want to get this conversation over with and be close to 100% staked eth, build the infra to support that seamlessly, and move on. Also the ~500 ETH additional yield we'll get from staking the 10k ETH is not nothing. It's being able to fund another ~$1M / year sized team. That's like being able to fund another nounish or agora sized team effort, which is meaningful! \nFor all these reasons... voting FOR!  \n\n*sent from voter.wtf*"},{"support":1,"voter":"0xCDEc866689af5EcA60da47733c669Fc44dc4500C","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x84044988e0754decAa7444d19c8BF069B977F128","numberOfVotes":2,"reason":""},{"support":2,"voter":"0x2A019853a00CA3Af202c262076Da3308f606277F","numberOfVotes":2,"reason":"I recommend everyone to read this report, <Is stETH Liquid Enough?>\nhttps://marketing.kaiko.com/is-steth-liquid-enough\n\nThe risk of mass liquidation of stETH is higher than we imagined."},{"support":0,"voter":"0x08cEb8Bba685ee708C9c4c65576837cbE19B9dea","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":"I am voting against this prop due to my concerns about Lido's overwhelming dominance in the liquid staking derivatives (LSD) sector.

We will determine how to divide up the 25,000 pieces in order to achieve the best possible dispersal around the world. We'd like to gang up shipments (one shipment per geographic area) so that the recipients can disperse smaller shipments to more recipients in the same geographic area.\n\n**On demand distribution:** Any left over stock beyond what is shipped to Builders will ship to our US warehouse where it will be processed and stored until it is needed by various funded props or people who buy them from us in bulk or in smaller quantities as needed at a discount. This will enable us to ship Proliferator Packs and disperse them around the world in single efficient packages.\n\n**Some examples of how the products could be used:**\n\nBundled “Party Packs”\n\n“Passed” Prop welcome bundle includes a case of 10 plastic Noggles, 50 paper Noggles and 50 pins. This is basically a Party Pack that enables a super fun Nouns-themed event and gives the builders an opportunity to share and document their experiences and journey, share info and more with the world as they build their project. $600 + shipping. \n\nProliferator Packs:\n\nFor Nouners and builders planning IRL events or contests: could come in 4 tiers to supply a variety of sizes of events and prize pools:\n\nTier 1: Single pair of Noggles: $20 + shipping\nTier 2: 50 pack Lo-Fi: $150 + shipping\nTier 3: 1 pair of Noggles, 50 Lo-Fi, 10 pins: $220 + shipping\nTier 4: Case of 10 noggles, 100 Lo-Fi, 50 pins: $750 + shipping\n\nThese numbers would be included in the various proposals and made available to all of the builders with passed props, or anyone wishing to supplement their executions.\n\n**Improved analytics:** Data gathered from the views and clicks of the Nounworks [Linktree](https://linktr.ee/nountown) and the back end of our [website](https://www.nounworks.wtf/) and [shop](https://bigshottoyshop.com/collections/nouns) have proven the effectiveness of the dispersal of Lo-Fi Glasses at events around the world. Usage of the included QR code (which leads to the Nountown Linktree) spikes around these activations. January 1, 2023 was the Rose Parade where the LoFi Noggles were handed out:\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BJeMbFQjY3.jpg)\n\n\nWe see similar spikes just after NFT Paris & NFT NYC dates, and the Licensing show in late June had a significant click-through spike because we instructed people to scan the QR code on site. (LoFi Noggles were also handed out at each of those events).\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/ryrFMZiK3.png)\n\nThe spikes in Linktree visits directly affect traffic to a variety of useful Nounish links including Nouns.wtf, Nounish.world, plus our informational website, Nouns shop, etc. This is proliferation in action! A really interesting note is that the people who receive the Noggles take them home and interact with the QR codes even more in the week following the event:\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/ryK6GGjK2.png)\nAbove, see the gradual increase in views (green) and clicks (purple) in the 3 days immediately following the Rose Parade (Jan 1). So none of the spikes are 1-day spikes, they are all nearly a week of increased traffic and discovery by people all over the world:\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BJBxmfit2.png)\n\n\n**About us:** As a veteran manufacturer in the Nouns ecosystem, [NOUNWORKS](https://twitter.com/nounworks) has a proven pipeline for delivering quality products.

Also, having them at our events offered another layer of experience for our party attendees by offering them as a “prop-for-participation” (it was great for attendees to be able to jump in a photo or video and play “pass the noggles,” etc…while meeting up for some pizza). Enjoy the energy this can bring to events all over! Would love to get a bunch for future events!\"*\n\n**Mucho Love:** *\"Lo-Fi Noggles are more than just fun cardboard eyewear for Mucho Love. They serve as a tangible manifestation of the spirit and ethos of our organization. As we engage in our various activations, these Noggles serve as an icebreaker, a conversation starter, and a symbol of our commitment to spreading joy and positivity. They enhance our content’s recognizability, making it stand out and resonate with audiences familiar with Nouns. They are instrumental in fostering community, spreading our message, and enhancing the impact of our work.\"\"*\n\n**Serpunk:** *I think this is a good idea. A low budget option to nounify any event should exist and I believe this is it!*\n\n**Nouns in Rio:** *\"We definitely need those for Nouns in Rio/NounsBR events!*\n\n**Nouns Amigos:** *\"Noggles set the vibes for any IRL event!

(See next prop which deals with ongoing funding for distribution of Nouns merch to members of the community).\n\nIn general once the unclaimed units get back to our USA warehouse, the cost to turn around and ship them again will be $2 per unit for the Lo-Fi Noggles and $2 more to ship them. They are in packs of 50 so that would be $200 shipped to get a pack of 50 back out to another country. That cost will be covered by the recipients or their props.\n\n# Info about our previous order:\n10K units were paid for by Nouns DAO (NSFW) and an additional 3K units were paid for by Bigshot.

Estimated to be $3-5M a year. Basis of the estimate is explained in detail in the proposal below.\n\n**Main value proposition to users of this product:** Increases users' asset allocation to hot wallets, thus helping users access DeFi and the metaverse in an agile, secure and comfortable manner, reducing time costs and transaction costs involved regularly refilling hot wallet accounts. Not a single hot wallet product exists in B2C form that gives users access to fully flexible threshold signing schemes. Nouns Wallet will be the first to introduce this idea, and in a fully transparent manner.\n\n**Ask:** \n25 ETH round 1\n\n25 ETH round 2\n\n**Detailed Proposal:**\n\nThe B2C hot wallet market has been under the firm grip of MetaMask, riding high on its first-mover advantage. However, this dominance has left customers vulnerable to unfair policies and practices imposed by MetaMask. First, they sneaked away from open-source code to closed-source. And now, brace yourself, their updated privacy policies grant them the power to track user IP addresses and more! Sure, they claim not to keep this data for more than 7 days or sell it, but can we really verify that? Who will be held accountable for any shenanigans? What are the loopholes in this web of secrecy? Plus, let's not forget, this opens up a single point of attack for snooping into customer data. The only way to escape this labyrinth is through complete transparency of code.\n\nBut wait, there's another gaping hole in the B2C hot wallet industry! It's the absence of fully flexible threshold signing schemes for users. Hot wallets are crucial for interacting with web3 applications and protocols. However, these hot wallets, like MetaMask, store the entire private key on the user's machine. It's like leaving the door wide open for attacks, as the key remains decrypted for the duration of wallet activity, in order to make digital signatures.\n\nNow, some wallets try to beef up security and tackle this single point of attack issue by offering 2-factor authentication (2FA) or even 3-factor authentication (3FA). But guess what? These traditional forms of 2FA or 3FA rely on third-party applications that specialize in 2FA, like Authy, Duo Mobile, or Google Authenticator, and/or depend on third-party entities, such as 2FA from Google Cloud or email codes. This introduces the dreaded risk of a centralized point of failure! It forces users to always have access to these third parties and assumes they will function flawlessly. Some wallets even offer 2FA through their own mobile apps or via SMS codes, but alas, this makes users susceptible to SIM swap attacks. And let me tell you, SIM swap attacks have wreaked havoc on crypto holders in the past. Countless articles on the internet can attest to that.\n\nAs if that wasn't enough, some wallets have attempted MultiSig, where one signature is required from the user's key and another from the company's key. But let me tell you, this setup is not only inefficient and inflexible, but also lacks ironclad security. Inflexible because any changes to the keys, adding or removing them, require rewriting the code. It's like making it set in stone when it comes to signing policies (2 of 2 or 2 of 3 being the most common) and the keys generated and used. Moreover, MultiSig demands exorbitant transaction fees due to the need for higher block space or, in simpler terms, multiple signatures required to sign the transaction on the chain.\n\nBut behold! We have the ultimate solution to tackle all of the above conundrums: Fully Open-Sourced Threshold Signing! Sounds cool, right? It's time to revolutionize the game and bring back the fun, security, and flexibility that users truly deserve!\n\n1-minute explainer video: [![Video](https://img.youtube.com/vi/uhbaVoQMKDU/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhbaVoQMKDU)\n\n\n![Image](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1FgrRd7k2ckTGqV1ByW1LyC5FbqBg3fBX)\n\n\n\nAdditionally, being fully open sourced makes us verifiably user-friendly in terms of privacy policies and security.\n\n**Estimated Revenue to the Nouns treasury from this project**\n\nLet's dive into the exciting realm of revenue figures! If we cast our eyes upon [this chart](https://dune.com/queries/19721/40444), MetaMask has been raking in around $200,000 per day in fees over the past few months. That's a whopping $70 million per year, give or take! For more in-depth insights, you can check out the [comprehensive dashboard](https://dune.com/tomhschmidt/metamask-swap) and enlightening [article](https://thedefiant.io/metamask-raking-in-170k-day-shows-defi-wallets-work-as-businesses) on MetaMask's daily and cumulative swap fee revenue.\n\nNow, let's shift our focus to Exodus, a prominent player in the hot wallet scene. In the last two Q3s, their quarterly revenues reached a commendable $18 million and $11 million, respectively. If you're hungry for details, head over to [this page](https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2022/11/09/2552383/0/en/Exodus-Report-Third-Quarter-2022-Results.html) and feast your eyes on the specifics.\n\nBut here's the exciting part: We aim to compete head-on with MetaMask and other hot wallets by offering a threshold MPC system ingeniously integrated into browser extension and web app hot wallets. With all the potential this project holds, we conservatively estimate that it could eventually churn out a remarkable $3 million to $5 million per year in swap fees alone. And who knows, it might even soar to the astounding heights of $70 million, just like MetaMask!\n\nWhen it comes to revenue distribution, we've got a plan. For the first three years, the revenue will be divided into a 90-10 split between the Nouns Treasury and the devoted development team. This approach ensures resources are allocated for continuous product enhancements and growth. However, after the three-year mark, the Nouns DAO holds the power to either renew this revenue split or gracefully take 100% of the revenue for themselves.\n\n**Funding Ask and Deliverables**\n[Figma Prototype](https://www.figma.com/proto/6YX5xeU16rpvhybQm8OMhR/Nouns-Wallet?node-id=1-2&scaling=min-zoom&page-id=0%3A1&starting-point-node-id=1%3A2)\n\n![Image](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1WKE6IrnbiDURXj5DwTGbfmVKP7GeG5QM)\n\n**25 ETH Round 1** – With a solid infusion of 25 ETH, we will kickstart the development of a basic yet functional Threshold Signing wallet. Within a swift timeline of just 2 months from the funding date, our talented team will focus their expertise on cryptography and backend wizardry. The frontend will have a simple, user-friendly interface adorned with a logo inspired by the captivating Nouns theme. To proudly showcase our collaboration, the wallet interface will prominently display \"Powered by NounsDAO.\" During this initial phase, we will demo the threshold signing capability exclusively on laptops. But fret not, as we have big plans for Round 2!\n\n\n**25 ETH Round 2** – Round 2, brace yourselves for greatness! With another 25 ETH in hand, we will elevate the UI/UX design aimed to maximize user experience and simplicity, ensuring that our wallet becomes an intuitive and seamless companion for crypto enthusiasts. As we fine-tune every detail, the wallet will be prepared for its grand launch. The timeline for this monumental event will be thoughtfully and collaboratively decided between our passionate team and the vibrant Nouns community.\n\n**Team**\nThe team building this are specialists in advanced cryptography and are also currently building a trustless bridge between non EVM chains.\nTo find out more about the team go to:\n[insaanity.io](https://insaanity.io)\n\n**Feedback from the Nouns community taken into consideration**\n\nWe express our heartfelt gratitude to the vibrant Nouns community on Discord and Discourse for their active participation and valuable feedback on our proposal. Your insights have been instrumental in shaping our approach, and we greatly appreciate your engagement.\n\nIn our previous communication, we had initially proposed a funding amount of 250 ETH for Round 2, with a significant portion of 200 ETH allocated towards code audits. This decision was primarily driven by our intention to utilize our proprietary threshold signing algorithm, which boasted certain advantages over the already audited threshold cryptography schemes available in the market. Notably, our algorithm showcased resilience against Denial of Service (DoS) attacks, providing an added layer of security.\n\nHowever, we carefully considered the community's concerns regarding the substantial expenditure of 200 ETH solely on code audits. We wholeheartedly understand and respect the need for responsible resource allocation. Therefore, we have revised our approach and made the decision to leverage already existing standard audited libraries as our foundation, building upon their established security foundations. This strategic shift has significantly reduced our funding request to a modest 25 ETH.\n\nTo address any lingering apprehensions regarding DoS attacks, we have further fine-tuned our strategy. Out of B2B and/or B2C options, we will adopt the B2C (Business-to-Consumer) model, where the distribution of key shares will be limited to one's own devices and/or trusted family members' devices, rather than across unknown communities' devices. This approach ensures a more controlled and secure environment, where the threat of DoS attacks can be safely assumed to be absent.\n\nWe remain committed to our goal of delivering an exceptional threshold signing wallet, fortified by security best practices and community-driven input. Your feedback has been invaluable in shaping our path forward, and we are excited to continue this journey together, building a product that exceeds expectations.\n\nOnce again, we extend our sincere appreciation to the Nouns community for your unwavering support and collaboration. Let's embark on this exciting endeavor, shaping the future of hot wallets with utmost diligence and innovation!\n\n\n\n","proposer":"0xfC5850A6bB134A6C19D31743200929b5D534ed93","startBlock":17719816,"endBlock":17755816,"executed":false},"votes":[{"support":0,"voter":"0xC9A43964B791e5aBd13B98fAc710132AbFCa873E","numberOfVotes":2,"reason":""},{"support":0,"voter":"0x008c84421dA5527F462886cEc43D2717B686A7e4","numberOfVotes":17,"reason":"The cost is low but I am not familiar with the team nor their track record (listed on their site, it's a hodge podge), the wallet field is very crowded and competitive and not immature, and the assumptions about the market and revenue look off to me.\n\nI appreciate the time that went into this and if the advisors like Corbin and Mason went to bat for why the team here will execute it, I might change my mind on a future proposal.

This is now for only 3 months and covers 1 full time dev + Joel Cares (part time strategy & dev).*\n\n*The primary work in this proposal is in continued development of Nerman.js, a Nouns SDK to help developers building in the Nouniverse. Actual discord bot development is a smaller part of the workload.*\n\n*We have also added much more specific features to each section in support of the general vision communicated before. Lesson learned - Nouns DAO does in fact prefer to see the long proposals with comprehensive details.*\n\n---\n\n## INTRO\n\n---\n\nNerman was funded by Nouns DAO through [Prop 77](https://nouns.wtf/vote/77). Our team has been hard at work programming Nerman's various bots and libraries since then. Check out [nerman.wtf](https://nerman.wtf) for a summary of the project and links to the various code repositories.\n\nIn this proposal we focus our efforts on two things:\n\n1. **Nerman.js ([GitHub](https://github.com/JoeCars/Nerman.js), [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nerman))**\n2. **Nounish Feeds - Discord Bot ([GitHub](https://github.com/JoeCars/Nerman))**.\n\n\n\n---\n\n## NERMAN.JS - A NOUNS SDK\n\n---\n\nNerman.js provides simple type-safe access to Nouns DAO contract events, as well as custom events such as Noun O'Clock. The user provides a JSON-RPC url and connects directly to an Ethereum node without any further 3rd party hosted services.\n\nYou can install Nerman.js with [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nerman)\n\n**DEMO - NOUN O'CLOCK**\n\n``` typescript\nimport * as nerman from \"nerman\";\nconst Nouns = new nerman.Nouns( JSON_RPC_API_URL );\nNouns.on(\"AuctionEnd\", (data : nerman.EventData.AuctionEnd) => {\n    // It's Noun O'Clock, do stuff here!!\n});\n```\n\nFor more code examples see the ReadMe in [GitHub](https://github.com/JoeCars/Nerman.js). Nerman.js currently supports listening to Nouns DAO events such as auction creation, auction bids, proposal creation, dao votes, Noun creation, Noun transfer, delegation changes, and more. We also launched support for [Nouns Nymz](https://nouns.nymz.xyz/) and have a live feed posting in a Nouns community Discord.\n\n**NEW FEATURES - EVENTS**\n\nNerman.js will provide and maintain access to events across the Nouniverse. For each event we will have:\n\n - properly typed listener functions\n - trigger functions and sample data for testing\n - unit tests with sample and live data\n - clear documentation on Nerman.wtf\n - easy config option in Nerman Discord bot for anyone to add customized event feeds to Discord\n\nNouns DAO Events\n - All DAO Contract Events completed as described above\n - Events that require further calculations, like Prop Voting Start, Prop Voting Complete (failed, or succeeded and ready to queue), Prop Ready to Execute\n - Helpers to better parse data + format posts (ie better prop transaction summaries)\n - Updates to v3 contract if it occurs within time period\n   \nProp House Events\n - When instantiating the Prop House object the user will specify a community address and get events specific to that House\n - RoundCreated, ProposingStarts, NewProposal, VotingStarts, NewVote, RoundComplete\n\nFederation Governance Pool\n - General tool for listening to Federation governance pool events, instantiated with the specific pool address\n - We will cover the basics (bid, cast vote, execute) and explore other useful events from the contract\n\nNounsNymz\n - New Post (already completed, live in NCD)\n\n**NEW FEATURES - INDEXING**\n\nNerman.js will index on-chain Nouns data. This indexed data allows Nerman to offer more complicated and instant analysis of the data, including reporting behavior of voters, bidders, vote participation rates, etc.\n\n - Pre-indexed Nouns data included with library\n - Library can continue indexing to keep data up to date\n - Or - go trustless - start from scratch and index everything yourself\n - All basic DAO data will be available through function calls\n - We will implement further functions that offer simple analysis, such as getting voter participation rates or a list of proposals sorted by transaction size.\n\n**NEW FEATURES - DOCUMENTATION**\n\n[Nerman.wtf](https://nerman.wtf) will be a canonical source of knowledge about the Nouniverse, above and beyond technical documentation of Nerman.js. Our resources will be a useful starting point for anyone developing in Nouns.\n\n- SEO research and optimization to target terms people are actually searching for\n- Canon documentation of Nounish contracts on Ethereum and their associated ABIs\n- Map of different off-chain and in development Nouns projects with links to websites\n\n---\n\n## DISCORD BOT - NOUNISH FEEDS\n\n---\n\nNerman offers customizable Nounish event feeds for Discord channels, displaying formatted embeds with the main Nouns DAO contract events from Nerman.js. Users can configure which events to display in a channel with a simple command.\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HyX8b1U_3.jpg)\n\n**CURRENT NOUNISH FEEDS**\n\n- **Agora Discord**\n  Auction and DAO Proposal events in #gov-updates channel\n- **A Nouns Community Discord**\n  Auction and Proposal events in #general channel\n  Nouns Nymz posts in #nouns-nymz\n- **Nouncil**\n  Auctions, Proposals, Token Transfers in Feeds Section\n  Proposal votes and status changes posted in appropriate Prop threads in #nouncil-votes\n\n\n**NEW FEATURES**\n\nWe will add all Nerman.js events as we create them, allowing easy Discord notifications from Nouns DAO, Prop House, Federation, etc.\n\n - All above events easily configured by any Discord admin.\n - Add support for arguments in event registration commands so we can use general tools (ie Prop House, Federation Goverance Pools) to create event listeners for any specific community.\n - Simple subscriptions to commonly grouped events (Auction, Goverance, transfer + delegation changes)\n - Improved formatting + data on embeds.\n - Continued work setting up and optimizing event feeds in Discords, including NCD, Agora, Nouncil, as well as general consulting to support feeds in communities.\n - Experimental feed ideas, like a 0 vote weight feed as an informal on-chain chat.\n - Discord forum integrations for Nouns DAO proposals where a thread is automatically created for each prop and DAO votes and prop status changes are posted in the appropriate threads.\n\n---\n\n## BONUS POINTS\n\n---\n\nWe intend to complete as much of the above scope as possible within 3 months. If we move ahead of schedule we will spend the remaining time working on the features below:\n\n**Contract events from Nounish DAOs**\nA generic NounishDAO object that takes a contract address as the argument, verifies the events that it supports, and offers instant access to supported events from any Nounish DAO (Lil Nouns, Gnars, Builder DAO, etc).\n\n**Snapshot Events**\nA Snapshot object that allows you to specify a community on Snapshot and listen to its events, such as new Proposals and votes, and to get results when the vote is complete. This will assist with automations for communities that use Snapshot to coordinate Nouns votes, like [SharkDAO](https://snapshot.org/#/sharkdao.eth) and [League of Lils](https://snapshot.org/#/leagueoflils.eth).\n\n**Discord forum integration for NounsNymz**\nWe can pipe NounsNymz into an automated Discord forum where each new top level comment is its own thread, and sub-comments are included in that thread. This presents the conversations better than a simple new comment feed and allows for non-nouner discord users to engage in the discussion as well. We can also support NounsNymz hashtags so prop specific comments can be piped into a Nouns DAO proposal forum.\n\n**Prop House - Token Specific Feeds**\nSpecify a token (ie Nouns DAO) and get notifications from all houses that use that token to vote. We could create a #nouns-prop-house channel that posts any new round Nouners can vote on along with their deadlines.\n\n**Image Helpers**\nA variety of helper functions for interacting with Nouns on-chain image data, rendering it and converting it between file formats, resizing, generating images from seeds, getting image data for addresses for profile images, etc.\n\n---\n\n## TERMS\n\n---\n\n- funding for the team to continue developing Nerman up to Oct 31, 2023. \n- all code will be open source and released under a permissive license (such as MIT).\n\n---\n\n## TRANSACTION\n\n---\n\n**Total Budget: 26 Ξ**\n1 full time dev + Joel Cares (part time)\n\n**Transaction**\n26 ETH streamed to 0x09b68020Fb9691C2c20687631EDCF16fdFCba277","proposer":"0x281eC184E704CE57570614C33B3477Ec7Ff07243","startBlock":17723947,"endBlock":17759947,"executed":true},"votes":[{"support":0,"voter":"0x05E70979fd3355133f91FC7C6597A8274169b3bE","numberOfVotes":5,"reason":""},{"support":0,"voter":"0x860B328060180b2A14ae5C018AbA2Dd42D7ab6bA","numberOfVotes":17,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0xFC218F1164cfEf8e4EC7c2aca8fB019DC8976214","numberOfVotes":20,"reason":"(noun 40 voting via agora)\n\nthis feels like a scale / funding amount that feels more appropriate to the level of usage that nerman has at the moment. there are many discord communities where bots are powered by nerman and it would be good to get these additional features built out. changing my vote to for.

Five will be a speaker at HelloWeb3 and promote nouns and stamp collection campaign. Also we will collaborate with a coffee shop next to ETHCon where people will be able to redeem their coupons for t-shirts. During 3 day period of the ETHCon, people will be able to redeem t-shirts with only 2-stamps. \n- To achieve this, we kindly request $52,000 or around $3,600 per location to promote nouns at 10+ coffee shops, 2 retail stores, and 2 art galleries over the next three months.\n\n## Revisions of prop 322\n- Reduce funding from $65,000 to $52,000\n    - Removed magazine -$4,000\n    - Reduced t-shirts batch size -$9,000 (from 2,000 to 1,500)\n- Collaboration with a coffee shop next to [Ethcon](https://twitter.com/ethconkr/status/1675701724613591040) conference. The conference will bring together a lot of interesting people since **Vitalik** is a keynote speaker. The coffee shop will welcome conference and hackathon participants, where they can learn about Nouns, mingle, and redeem a t-shirt.\n- Five is going to join [HelloWeb3](https://twitter.com/hello_web3) conference as a speaker and it will be a good opportunity to launch Nouns' campaing and reach the target audience.\n\n### Details\nWe have observed the success of Nouns' flywheel in Brazil, China, Japan, and other communities. We propose to launch activation campaign in Korea in collaboration with ten authentic coffee shops. This campaign aims to educate people about nouns and engage them in the process. Participants will collect noggle-stamps and have the chance to earn stylish nounish t-shirts as rewards.\n\nOur team firmly believes in our energy and talent to establish Nouns as a prominent pop culture brand in Korea. The campaign will span three months, during which people will receive noggle-stamps with their coffee purchases. Once they collect 10 stamps, they can exchange a coupon card for a nounish t-shirt.\n\nTo ensure widespread exposure, all coffee shops will display posters and t-shirts. Furthermore, these t-shirts will be available for purchase at retail stores and art galleries. We are committed to creating high-quality t-shirts using nounish cc0 content, with additional approval from the artists involved.\n\n\nFor the successful activation of the nouns community in Korea and the promotion of Nouns in 14+ locations over three months, we kindly request $52,000 in funding.\n\n### The stamp collection campaign\n![](https://i.imgur.com/51HGjJe.jpg)\n\nThe campaign will focus on creating visibility, engaging local community, and establishing a loyal fan base. The coffee shops will become a place for people to gather and learn about nouns through arts on t-shirts and information in korean online.\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/B1e0gbXuh.png)\n\nCoupon cards featuring nouns will be distributed at the coffee shops' counters. We anticipate each coffee shop to distribute around 50-30 coupon cards daily, totaling approximately 27,000 cards throughout the campaign. In our focused campaign, we will give out special coupon cards that need only 2 stamps to people who are interested in blockchain and NFTs through our network of friends.\n\n### T-shirts\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/ByDeX5Md3.jpg)\n\nT-shirts will be placed in highly visible areas at coffee shops. We'll use Nouns' cc0 content to create a beautiful collection of t-shirts. Our goal is to pleasantly surprise everyone with the quality and spirit of nounish artworks.\n\nThese t-shirts will be made from scratch specifically for this campaign from high-quality materials and tailored in various styles for both men and women. Each label and tag will feature Noggles and links to Noun's homepage and Twitter account.\n\nWe will strategically strive to get the t-shirts in the hands of pop stars, actors, musicians, and models.\n\nThe t-shirts will be the same as those for prop173, 'Sail in NY,' that received praise from the community for their quality.\n\n### Campaign map\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/H1Zj0T5u3.jpg)\n\nWe are going to collaborate with authentic coffee shops. Here are the links to coffee shops located in popular areas such as [Jeongno](https://www.instagram.com/cha.teul/), [Itaewon](https://www.instagram.com/theroyalfad/), and [Sinsa](https://www.instagram.com/minoscoffeecult/). Additionally, we are going to sell t-shirts at popular [Fashion and lifestyle](https://www.instagram.com/niceweather.seoul/) goods stores and [art galleries](https://www.instagram.com/print_bakery/).\nAs of now, we onboarded three coffee shops, one retail store, and one art gallery. We can rest of the partner properties recruited in no time.\n\n### Why Korea\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SJUNQsvw2.jpg)\n\nKorea is known for its collection of cool nounish items, ranging from sailboats, resin toys, and children's books to motorcycles. In line with this, our goal is to unite and provide a firsthand experience to an increasing number of Nouns' fans. We believe that the timing is ideal to launch a nounish campaign, aiming to showcase the beautiful aspects of Nouns' art, culture, and governance. This initiative will not only attract a larger base of devoted fans but also facilitate the discovery of new nounish memes and contribute to the advancement of nounish culture.\n\n### Timeline\nThe campaign is scheduled to commence in July and continue until October.

Each episode takes us on a new challenge or puzzle to be solved by the protagonists. They embark on magical missions, explore galaxies, secret rooms, and discover hidden passages that lead to incredible worlds within the school. The school environment transforms into a place full of surprises, with magic, creatures, and fantastic moments.\n\nWhile facing exciting challenges, the protagonists also learn important lessons about friendship, courage, and teamwork. They discover that true power lies in unity and trust in one another.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/V7CflxQ.png)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/jf2PpS1.png)\n\nThe **primary target audience will be children aged 7-11**. Our main goal is to inspire them through relatable characters, engaging stories, and meaningful dialogue that resonates with their own aspirations for the future. \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/UbWKeiv.png)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/bXF0WBs.png)\n\nThe show will maintain a family-friendly atmosphere, exploring various themes like friendship, adventures, and romance. We also aim to **subtly introduce educational elements**, including more advanced concepts such as web3, blockchains, and DAOs, providing young viewers with an introduction to these complex topics.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/AZUWCpG.png)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/MBIaOKr.png)\n\n\n[Here you can find a complete breakdown of these first 5 characters, as well as initial plot concepts and script.](https://interesting-taker-974.notion.site/A-Nouns-Series-by-Breakout-10eafd6961da448083b45df3fea6c9fa)\n\n---\n# References:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Wd6LA3e.png)\n\n---\n# **Jux Animation Studio:**\n\n[Jux ](https://www.juxfilmes.com.br/)is an established animation studio and will be the company responsible for the production of the series. With a strong track record in the animation industry, the company has worked for many well known clients and brings a wealth of experience and expertise to the project.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/C2yPsUy.png)\n\nJux has a vast network of professionals from around the world, including illustrators, animators, writers, and sound producers, who will also contribute to the series.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/NqRaQtY.gif)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/KyEEXby.png)\n\nJux also produced the short film \"Through the Looking Noggle!\" as an entry to the Nouns video contest. The video recieved an overwhelmingly positive response, and was chosen as one of the four winning entries.\n\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/sghZnjI.gif)\n\n[Website and Full Reel](https://www.juxfilmes.com.br/) \n\n\n---\n# Core Team:\n\n#### **Marcello Laruccia (Animation Director)** - [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marcello-laruccia-84b09b23)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/lJ0ujhf.gif)\n\n[Full Reel](https://www.dropbox.com/s/53qdlfgy24x6z68/MLaruccia_reel_2023.mov?dl=0)\n#### **Victor Canela (Lead Writer)** - [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/victorgaz/)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/BbdCk21.png)\n\n#### **Bruno Tedesco (Animation Supervisor)** - [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bruno-tedesco-b9829538/)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/zfALXei.gif)\n\n[Full Reel](https://vimeo.com/457995567)\n#### **Patrick Dias (Creative Lead)** - [Portfolio](https://patrickdias.work/about-me)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/CDSEXoE.png)\n---\n\n**Alongside the team above, many other talented professionals will be involved in the production of this pilot including:**\n\n[JukeBox](https://www.juke.art.br/) (Audio Production)\n[Daniela Zschaber](https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniela-zschaber/) (Writer)\n[Aurelio Ribeiro/TheBower](https://twitter.com/thebower_) (Exec. Producer)\n[Daniel Ferrari ](https://www.linkedin.com/in/d2-ferrari-a90b822b/)(Producer)\n\nAs well as supporting **illustrators, animators and editors**.\n\n---\n# Production Timeline:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/U7CxXj4.png)\nAbove you can find a **detailed view of each step in the production process.**\n\nDelivery of the first episode will be within **4 months** of this proposal acceptance. \nThroughout the production we will be posting **regular updates on a dedicated Telegram channel**, including teasers and details of the process.\n\n\nAfter delivering the pilot we will submit a proposal to produce the subsequent 4 episodes. All episodes after this first one will have a smaller, 1.5-month, production period each due to a lot of the ground work being done already, such as character and background development.\n\n\n# Distribution:\n\n#### - Youtube\nOur initial strategy will be to upload the series directly to a dedicated Youtube channel. **Content for kids on Youtube performs extremely well** and garners massive views. Our intent is to capture that audience and generate a significant viewership with a dedicated fanbase.\n\n#### - Droposal\nMuch like similar content released by Nouns, we will also seek to mint this first episode via a droposal.\n\n**However, we propose a novel distribution with 100% of the funds going back to the DAO.** The idea is to do a community poll with Nouners to decide the mint price.\nBased on the success of this first episode and mint sales we could see a significant revenue returning back to the DAO.\n# Road To Success:\n\nAfter the delivery of the pilot our intent is not only to produce the remaining episodes but to build the project into something even bigger. Here are some of the strategies we are planning:\n\n*(The following ideas are for the future of the project and not included in this proposal)*\n\n- Distribution Deal: Pursue partnerships through our industry contacts with TV channels and streaming providers - We believe the series would have a strong appeal to these companies as not only having a popular target audience of young teens but also by addressing new and innovative topics like blockchain and web3. \n- Merchandising and Toys: Partner with established companies to produce Merch and Toys featuring the characters in the series bringing another revenue stream for the series and the DAO.\n\n---\n\n# Budget Breakdown:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/bG8tmAl.png)\n\n([Google sheet with complete budget breakdown](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1arqB7sFMJ9HpEraUbgLuhSR9cDxoOKv-pNQfC_2XP1I/edit?usp=sharing))\n\n\n**Total Ask: USDC $95.000** (~48 ETH at current prices)\n\n\n**This budget reflects the production of a high-quality, 6-minute animated pilot**, which also serves as the foundation for the series - this includes character design and personality, environment, plot, among other essential work.\n\n---\n## From The Team\n\n**Our objective is to create an amazing series that is unique and truly nounish.**\n\nWith this pilot we hope to showcase the concept and viability of this series, as well as lay a strong foundation on which we can build upon.\n\nOur team is passionate and commited to this project, many of us are strongly connected to the Nouns ecosystem and have a deep interest in its collective success.\n\nThank you!\n\n---\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","proposer":"0x8ac3ecf6973E020cC0E6e8989Fb71B4a77D65987","startBlock":17744220,"endBlock":17780220,"executed":false},"votes":[{"support":0,"voter":"0x55b0a25d697647281553a177321DAd0a0Bf9A148","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":"Have learned that it is not a case of 'build it and they will come' when it comes to content.

Yearly players from every corner of the globe come out to not only compete, but to fraternize and create memories that will last a lifetime.*\n\n*With the scale and magnitude of EVO within the fighting game community, this would be a perfect opportunity for Nouns Esports to expand from Smash into the larger fighting game esports sphere.*\n\n*Our objective this year is for Nouns to make a splash in the fighting game esports scene by sponsoring a large group of fighting game players at the largest fighting game tournament in the world! With the new Street Fighter title, this is the year to be at EVO and there would be many opportunities for the Nouns Esports brand to catch viewer and participant attention.*\n\n*Nouns Esports requests 36,000 USDC to sponsor a variety of fighting game players from around the world to attend EVO, the world’s largest fighting game tournament, taking place from Aug 4th to the 6th in 2023.*\n\n![EVO Tournament Pic](https://i.imgur.com/Xs9lUCU.jpg)\n\n\n## Description\n\n\n\nThis proposal expands our esports reach into the world of fighting games. \n\nSelection will be handled through [Prop House](https://prop.house/nouns-esports/) with Nouns Esports members providing outreach directly to fighting game community encouraging players to apply on the site.\n\n\n**Our plan:** \n- Around 30－40 Competitors at EVO\n    - All representing Nouns\n        - Noggles for all players + shirts\n- Noggles for all players\n- Nouns Esports shirts with a mock up visual for all players\n- Planned Nouns team-building/social event during EVO \n    - Idea: Pizza Party (potential PizzaDAO collab)\n- Planned media coverage (photos/video) - \n    - Questions like: \"What does Evo mean to you? Nouns?\"\n- start.gg affiliation (putting the Nouns custom tag when registering on start.gg for a tournament in the format of [Nouns | Keolaization]) \n\n**Funding Plan:**\n\n- 36,000 USDC ask \n- Unused funds will be returned\n    - Player Funding Cost (~75%)\n        - For each player the standard funding we will be providing to sponsor their travel and lodging is 300 USDC for North America and 800 USDC for international players\n    - Pizza Party/Social Event Funding Cost (~10%)\n            - Food: Pizza\n            - Drinks: Sodas/Water\n            - Venue: Either rent out a restauraunt/suite/conference space\n            - Other potential items: Plates, utensils, napkins, cups\n        - Possibility to run social event though PizzaDAO\n    - Operational Management and Support (~15%)\n        - Contributor pay\n        - Cost of travel for organizers to oversee the event\n        - Miscellaneous costs\n\n## **Why EVO?**\n\nLast year there were over 7,000 players participating from 63 different countries, with nearly 18,000 players in attendace at the venue, and over 3.7 million people who tuned in to the live stream for the event. This year, as COVID-19 restrictions loosen in many places around the world and things return to normal, it is guaranteed to grow even bigger. Especially with the prize pool minimum for main games being increased to $25,000, there will undoubtedly be more participants coming out to try prove their worth.\n\nMany select top players at this event are sponsored by various different companies and esports organizations, but there are many more who are either not sponsored despite their high levels of play or are sponsored but are not able to make it to Evo due to financial reasons such as lack of support from their team. This is where Nouns Esports can come into the picture.\n\nThrough players applying through Prophouse, we can sponsor select players based off of their skill as well as their needs to give them the chance to have the best possible experience at Evo. Whether it be a full ride for an extremely high level player or just a small boost to their funds, providing to the needs of the player will not only allow Nouns Esports to show their goodwill to the community, but can also spread the Nouns Esports brand and the Nouns brand to a potentially new community. Not only that, but if we can successfully sponsor the most players, it would be a huge PR win for the organization.\n\n\n\n## Who We Are\n\nNouns Esports was established in [Proposal 68](https://nouns.wtf/vote/68). We have since continued Nouns proliferation through esports as seen in [Proposal 91](https://nouns.wtf/vote/91), [Proposal 112](https://nouns.wtf/vote/112), [Proposal 119](https://nouns.wtf/vote/119).\n\nDota 2 & CS:GO\nPokemon Unite\nTaki & Aklo\n\n[nouns.gg](https://nouns.gg)\n[Twitter](https://twitter.com/nounsesports)\n[Discord](https://discord.gg/nounsesports)\n\n\n\n\n## **Multisig**\n\nWe will be using the same multisig that was created for [Proposal 263](https://nouns.wtf/vote/263) consisting of Nouners and Nounsfolk. \n\n- Sasquatch\n- Brennen\n- Maty\n- Oni\n- Peter\n\n![Nouns Esports Logo](https://i.imgur.com/rPHF40P.jpg)\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAll in all, we are looking to make a splash in the larger fighting game esports scene by setting the right foot forward and trying to make history. We really believe that we can gain traction and show our Nounish values to the larger community to create a long lasting relationship that will benefit both sides.\n\n### **Thank you for reading!**\n\n\n","proposer":"0x91dCCAA260CC4616E1a6e6b693DB7207C5E42937","startBlock":17748193,"endBlock":17784193,"executed":false},"votes":[{"support":0,"voter":"0xF9bf4c994B39D742E568096A04637EDc5E8e6fdA","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":0,"voter":"0xC9A43964B791e5aBd13B98fAc710132AbFCa873E","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x2ED22eA03fEA3e5BD90f6Fdd52C20c26ff6e1300","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":2,"voter":"0xeb13fdDFA9B2A4a6E4e7B2D67b6E38C208C41249","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":""},{"support":0,"voter":"0xD25973a3Df7d2341DDEa48303a3E6AdDEc6184Bf","numberOfVotes":23,"reason":""},{"support":0,"voter":"0x36A5Bc205DF1ED65C86301022cfc343a6ce546ff","numberOfVotes":2,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x8d2B28265bEE1C926433A25D951adb03De9Ab275","numberOfVotes":2,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x2666f0C8FB58d182f2Dd79475DCA4A07B3724607","numberOfVotes":4,"reason":"EVO is a huge part of the gaming ecosystem for both esports are gamers in general.

These physicals could be easily seen all over the world!\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HkCH-sZKh.png)\n\nEg; [JP](https://twitter.com/eusou_jp) and his team has built a [website](https://desafionouns.wtf/) using cc0 assets from [Nouns Explainer](https://nouns.wtf/vote/113) for [200K Video Contest Prop](https://nouns.wtf/vote/181).\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HyxRm-Nhdh.gif)\n\n**Distribute**\n* We offer an instant & user-friendly search feature to help users for quick results on the content they need.\n* Users can favourite contents they need for latter and easily access their favorite contents on the main page. \n* We provide a comment section on every contents. We also integrated with Farcaster, a decentralized social network, as any responses for a cc0-lib's content url will be displayed under *fc comments* on the corresponding cc0-lib's content page. For example → [https://warpcast.com/n1/0x69b8c3](https://warpcast.com/n1/0x69b8c3)\n* We provide search persistence which allows users to persist the last search history they made on the website.\n* RSS - [cc0-lib.wtf/feed.xml](https://cc0-lib.wtf/feed.xml)\n\n*cc0-lib-fav*\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rJ0Rzv7qh.gif)\n\n*cc0-lib-comment*\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/ByEVVqQc2.png)\n\n**Contribute**\n* We provide a submission page for builders and artists to share their project materials within the ecosystem.\n* We want users to remix and shape new ideas upon the materials in any medium they prefer, fostering creativity in the ecosystem.\n* We introduce a contributor's leaderboard with the idea of incorporating a gamified experience to encourage participation in the ecosystem.\n* We are planning to create a token rewards system for contributors: Implement a system where contributors are rewarded with tokens based on their level of contribution to incentivize their participation. For example ;\n    * Tie unique NFTs (1/1s or OEs) to different levels of contribution (eg; 10, 50, 100, 1000 files)\n    * Organize challenges or competitions where contributors can compete and earn additional tokens or special NFT rewards based on their performance.\n    * Participation NFTs for prop house round, airdropped to all contributors / participants\n\n*cc0-lib-leaderboard*\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SJi2b5Qqn.gif)\n\n*cc0-lib-rewards (example)*\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/Hk7C8Yjth.png)\n\n---\n\n### **Public API**\n\n* We are excited to announce that we have introduced a public API under the /api/data endpoint, enabling users to effortlessly retrieve data for various purposes.\n* Developers can use the cc0-lib's public API to access a wide range of data, including images, videos, audio files, and more. \n* With this comprehensive collection of CC0 licensed content, developers can integrate high-quality media into their applications, websites, and creative projects with ease. \n* Whether you're building a content aggregator, a creative platform, or a media-rich application, the CC0 library's public API provides a valuable resource for accessing and utilizing CC0 licensed content.\n\nAPI → [cc0-lib.wtf/api](https://cc0-lib.wtf/api)\n\n---\n\n## **3. What we are looking to build next?**\n\nThese are the upcoming enhancements and features we will implement in the near future. We will also integrate based on user's feedbacks.\n\n- users profile & web3 connect\n- bookmark/pin\n- token rewards system for contributors\n- open-sourcing\n- more cc0 communities, more cool stuffs!\n\n---\n\n## **4.

However, they are not easy to do well because it's difficult to put one together both technically and socially.\n\nWe're going to build a super fast and easy to use droposal creator that also automatically updates nouns.wtf and and other frontends to feature any drops that the DAO approves.\n\n### What's the problem?\n\nWe know that Droposals can be wildly impactful. They can:\n1. Generate hundreds of ETH of revenue for the DAO and Builders\n2. Create more accessible ownership to canonical Nouns media\n3. Curate our best creations, making our body of work more legible\n\nTalking to builders, there seems to be two major barriers to creating more successful droposals:\n\n1. Creating a droposal is not easy – it requires putting together a complex transaction, and is subject to the same level of approvals as a potential protocol upgrade\n3. Even when you do manage create one, droposals are only successful if we're able to rally the whole community behind the mint\n\nAs a result, although Droposals have demonstrated success, we have not been able to make use of the format consistently as a community.\n\n\n### What we're doing\nWe're going to make it super easy to deploy and rally all of our attention resources behind droposals. The goal is to make it super easy to create a drop, and then to rally the DAO's excitement arond the mint. Concretely, this means a few things:\n\n**Step 1: Create a simple and powerful Drops Creator**\nWe'll deploy a drops-specific gov contract and a super easy to use droposal creator at nounsagora.com/drop. More details on how this contract works in the next section!\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HJqFrgI9n.png)\n\n**Step 2: Make drops incredibly exciting!**\nWe'll update both nounsagora.com and nouns.wtf to display droposal mints on the front page when there is one. This helps bring attention to the drop, further bring it into canon, and rally the community's excitement. \n\nOver the long term, we'll also work with other NFT sites like Zora and others to feature Nouns Drops so that getting your Droposal approved will catapult an artist to the top of every NFT site.\n\n[![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/S15Z7Ew52.png)](https://i.imgur.com/dCASfeo.mp4)\n\n**Step 3: Profit and proliferate!**\nBy making droposals accessible and impactful for artists, we think this Proposal will not only pay for itself, but also help us monetize and promote all future media funded by Nouns.\n\n### Drops creator contract early design\n\nSo how does the Drops creator actually work? Well, it's a bit like a mini governor contract controlled by Nouns token holders strictly for the purpose of managing and issuing drops. It does a two things: \n\n**Issue drops**\nAka create Droposals according to one of the types available.\n\n**Manage drop types**\nDrop types dictate the terms of the drop (price, editions, etc) in advance so that artists only have to put up their media for voters to decide whether they're excited about the work itself. \n\nOn launch, we will initiate the contract with a single flagship proposal type modeled after the successful This Is Nouns drop. The rough terms we're thinking are: 12 per year, 0.069ETH, 3000 editions. Split will be 60% artist, 30% DAO, 10% Agora.\n\nAnyone can create a type and set their own params, including fee. We could see there being many other types that are stewarded by different teams with different economics and cadence such as:\n* Free drop: free & unlimited on an L2, optimistically approved droposal\n* Oscars drop: only one allowed per year, more expensive, and high quorum to pass\n* Drops segmented by media type: episodes of a movie, Nounish\n\n\n### Future considerations\nIf the initial feature is successful, we have many ideas on how we can push drops even further:\n\n* We can make it easy to drop on L2s, which could be especially meaningful for free mints.\n* Approval voting can be used to choose one of many proposals to mint as the yearly \"Best media\". Almost like the Oscars of Nouns media\n* Droposals can act as a curation mechanism for us to find \"the best of\" Nouns. Using this, we can create a high quality Nouns media site showcasing our best work. Ranking on the site can be determined by the popularity of the mint\n\n\n### Funding & logistics\n\n**Funding**\n* We request 20ETH upfront to cover costs\n* Agora will charge a 10% fee on the flagship droposal type, and will return the first 20ETH in fees to the nouns treasury via a [0xSplit waterfall](https://docs.0xsplits.xyz/core/waterfall).\n* Anyone meeting the proposal threshold can create a droposal type with no fee (all dropoasal types will be minted from the same address)\n\n**Timeline**\n* Agora will provide biweekly progress updates\n* Expected to complete all within 2 months\n* When the contract is completed, another proposal will be created to deploy the drops creator and set its name to drops.nouns.eth","proposer":"0xC3FdAdbAe46798CD8762185A09C5b672A7aA36Bb","startBlock":17774104,"endBlock":17810104,"executed":true},"votes":[{"support":1,"voter":"0x3Cbd57dA2F08b3268da07E5C9038C11861828637","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":"Droposals are extremely important because they demonstrate a way for the DAO to signal support without spending funds.

I think it's fun and to some extent a tradition that can evolve to be really legible and inviting. saying \"the art can be updated any time by anyone if it passes gov\" while it sounds open and welcoming can have the inverse affect of paralysis to a newcomer. my hope would be for us to continue this anniversary art update tradition (and iterate on the process) while also being open to serendipitous submissions throughout the year (why not both?). as long as the serendipitous submissions are small in scope and is faced with a high bar (which we'll likely maintain) then I feel the two paths of art updates can coexist.\n\non this prop itself, while I totally see that the submission was more open and community driven this year (basically it seems like the most active and respected pixel artists in the #noundry channel at one point realized that no one else will make the anniversary art submission prop if they don't do it themselves), I do agree with the perspective that the process *feels* a bit closed / opaque / gated (sorry goldy!). would love to think through how to make the process more legible \n and structured while maintaining the same quality and coherence of the outcome.\n\na potential idea:\n- invite heads and accessories to be submitted whenever to a public place (have it be known that if your art gets included on the anniversary art update then you'll likely win X eth in retro funding enforced by tradition)\n- invite competition for curation through a mandated PH round 1-2 months ahead of anniversary. the mandated round selects the winning curation and includes a meaningful eth prize to incentivize and compensate for the work involved.\n- the winning curation team submits the art update prop to coincide with the anniversary (given the legitimacy through the mandated PH round, it will likely pass).\n\nsomething like the above might strike a good balance. anyhow, incredible set of pixels this year! thank you all again for this labor of love.

If you’re new to CC0, it’s a \"no copyright reserved\" option in which all copyright is relinquished and dedicated to the public domain. This enables use of CC0 NFTs with zero legal repercussions, inspiring creative derivatives and remixes of original works. \n\nCC0 may be everywhere, but here’s a lesser-known fact: Creative Commons is also a whole nonprofit organization (see our most recent annual report [here](https://creativecommons.org/2023/04/11/state-of-the-commons-2022/)). \n\nWe’ve been around since 2001 and are a small but mighty team of 22 open access enthusiasts. We not only manage the CC licenses and public domain tools, we run campaigns, programming, and training in Open Education, Culture, Climate, and Journalism; host a CC Global Summit in locations around the world; and tackle major policy issues impacting the Internet and global commons as part of a broad Movement for a Better Internet. \n\nWe’re doing a lot, but it is all in service of the CC licenses, a thriving commons, and a healthy public domain, which can be expanded instantly by contemporary creators embracing the use of CC0, a globally interoperable public domain dedication tool. Like Nouns, we’re big promoters of remix culture, and have been watching (_largely from the sidelines until now!_) as NFT creators bring new energy and enthusiasm to the public domain.  \n\nWe’re excited to bring our two communities together to demonstrate the staying power of open access tools like CC0 even in a technological landscape that’s rapidly changing. Nouns is a prime example of this. You’re an open-source brand merging CC0 with blockchain. Nouns demonstrates the imaginative possibilities of combining public interest tools like CC Licenses with emergent technologies. \n\n# Request\n\nDespite being components of longstanding and emerging technologies, CC licenses are hard to fundraise for–most people are unaware that there’s no underlying revenue stream to maintain their legal and tech infrastructure and continue to advocate for their use. The licenses are not new tech anymore, despite constantly being used in fresh ways, and it’s challenging when most funders are more interested in flashy new projects than supporting the work those ventures build on. \n\nWe are dedicated to preserving and improving our licenses, so that they can continue to be the go-to tool for future technology and creative work. That’s why CC is seeking funding for our general operations and license infrastructure, which would allow us to sustain currently underfunded but foundational areas of work: advocating for the use and adoption of open content at all levels and in all arenas, stewarding and innovating the licensing infrastructure we provide, and training future generations of creators and open advocates. \n\nWith support from Nouns, Creative Commons can prioritize the stewardship of the tools that have unlocked access to an estimated 2 billion works over the past 20 years. We are hoping your community will support us, as our work has supported your creativity.\n\n# Proposed Transactions\n\nDue to challenges that arise when Endaoment smart contracts are paired with Nouns proposal duration, this revised version of Prop 329 sends 100 ETH directly to Creative Commons' hosted wallet: \n\n0xf28ed835261b005C490D9d3D9eaADC54d9737d87","proposer":"0x83fCFe8Ba2FEce9578F0BbaFeD4Ebf5E915045B9","startBlock":17822608,"endBlock":17858608,"executed":false},"votes":[{"support":0,"voter":"0x860B328060180b2A14ae5C018AbA2Dd42D7ab6bA","numberOfVotes":17,"reason":"THEY HAVE $4,000,000.00 IN CASH ALREADY"},{"support":0,"voter":"0x7dE92ca2D0768cDbA376Aac853234D4EEd8d8B5C","numberOfVotes":24,"reason":""},{"support":0,"voter":"0xF7CFc8B249c46eDe9CCCDa3A08ECB58f88262623","numberOfVotes":3,"reason":""},{"support":1,"voter":"0x08cEb8Bba685ee708C9c4c65576837cbE19B9dea","numberOfVotes":1,"reason":"A fitting opportunity to support a non-profit organization whose mission is kindred to a lot of Nounish efforts. 100% support this prop.\n\n*sent from voter.wtf*"},{"support":0,"voter":"0xC9A43964B791e5aBd13B98fAc710132AbFCa873E","numberOfVotes":2,"reason":"SHADY proposal. \n\nfrom https://projects.propublica.org/nonprofits/organizations/43585301 and https://app.endaoment.org/orgs/04-3585301: this nonprofit last year had a net income of $6.73m, net assets for $8.90m, they are paying the executives $800k/year, why do they ask us for $190k to \"support the organization’s general operations\"????
